You can add new files and edit existing files directly in GitHub. If you prefer working locally but aren't familiar with Git, see [using-git.md](using-git.md).

If you aren't familiar with Markdown, a guide to the basic syntax is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
