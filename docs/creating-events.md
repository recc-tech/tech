# Creating BoxCast and Church Online Platform Events

## BoxCast
1. Go to the "New Broadcast" section.
2. Create events for the kids service.
	1. Name the event `Kids Connection LIVE: [date]`. The `[date]` will automatically be replaced by the date of the event.
	2. Make the event recurring on a weekly basis
	3. Set the start time to 10:00 and the end time to 10:25.
	4. Set the video quality to 1080p @30fps.
	5. Set the source to "Primary RECC Stream."
	6. Check the "Enable Live-Only" box.
3. Create events for the main service.
	1. Name the event `Sunday Gathering LIVE: [date]`. The `[date]` will automatically be replaced by the date of the event.
	2. Make the event recurring on a weekly basis
	3. Set the start time to 10:25 and the end time to 11:40.
	4. Set the video quality to 1080p @30fps.
	5. Set the source to "Primary RECC Stream."
4. The events should now be visible in the BoxCast dashboard.

> :warning: __Important!__  \
> Facebook, YouTube, and any other destinations should only be added for the event that will contain the Sunday Gathering content. Do ___not___ add them for any event thay contains Children's Ministry content. This is due to a licensing conflict. The copyright holders only allow us to stream such content to our own website. 

> :warning: __Important!__  \
> Do ___not___ check the "Enable Live-Only" box when creating the main service. If you enable that option, BoxCast will not record the event as the broadcast progresses. The upshot will be that you will have to upload a local recording, BoxCast will have to transcode this recording, and it will take much longer to set up the rebroadcasts. For example, it will take approximately 20 minutes to upload a local recording, and as transcoding is a 1:1 process it will take at least as long as the local recording's file length for it to be ready for rebroadcast. 

## Church Online Platform
