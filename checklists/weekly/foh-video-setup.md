# FOH Setup Checklist

For more details, see the [ProPresenter quick start guide](https://github.com/recc-tech/tech/wiki/ProPresenter-Quick-Start-Guide).

## Setup

- [ ] Turn on the projectors and make sure they're lined up properly.
- [ ] Download any new media from Planning Center Online to `/Users/visuals/Documents/ProPresenter Assets`.
- Set up the standard playlist elements:
    - [ ] Walk-in slides and announcements
    - [ ] Videos (opener, bumper, announcements)
    - [ ] Songs
    - [ ] Message
- [ ] For each slide, make sure you use the correct look:
    - "Lyrics" for song lyrics
    - "Scripture" for Bible verses
    - "Message" for the sermon notes
    - "No NDI" otherwise, especially for slides like the lyrics backgrounds that are likely to be used immediately after lyrics.
- [ ] Look for special events in the plan on Planning Center Online (e.g., baptism, child dedication).
- [ ] Look for special requests or notes (e.g., custom lyrics, scripture to be shown before worship):
    - [ ] On Planning Center
    - [ ] By email (tech@riversedge.life)
- [ ] Once the rehearsal is done, play each video to make sure the sound is working.
- [ ] Turn off the red light and the stage lights.
- [ ] Play some music from Spotify.
- [ ] Show the walk-in slides.
- [ ] Turn on NDI Video Monitor and select NDI > Desktop-D9Q3BCP > vMix - Output 1.

## Checks

If you have time, check these things.

- [ ] Check that all slides look good on the projector and on NDI (e.g., the text isn't too small).
- [ ] Remove walk-in slides and MC announcements that are definitely outdated.

## General Reminders

- Control the lights:
    - Lower MASTER LEVEL to 0 when a video is played and raise it back to 10 afterwards.
    - Lower CROSSFADERS Y to about 5 when the speaker reads scripture and raise it back to 10 afterwards.
- If the speaker goes over time, flash the red light a few times and then leave it on.
