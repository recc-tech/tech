# FOH Setup Checklist

For more details, see the [ProPresenter quick start guide](https://github.com/recc-tech/tech/wiki/ProPresenter-Quick-Start-Guide).

## Setup

- [ ] Turn on both projectors and make sure ProPresenter has the audience screen activated.
- [ ] Download any new media from Planning Center Online. Move the files to `/Users/visuals/Documents/ProPresenter Assets`.
- [ ] Set up the playlist according to the plan on Planning Center Online.
    - [ ] Walk-in slides
    - [ ] Videos
    - [ ] MC welcome, announcements, and goodbye slides
    - [ ] Worship and reprise
    - [ ] Message
- [ ] Look for special events on Church Online Platform.
- [ ] Look for special requests (e.g., custom lyrics, scripture before worship) at tech@riversedge.life.

## Checks

- [ ] Check that all slides have the correct looks.
    - All lyrics should have the lyrics look, scripture should have the scripture look, message notes should have the message notes look, and everything else (especially the background loop at the beginning of each song) should have the "No NDI" look.
- [ ] Check that the message notes have consistent formatting (title vs sentence case, punctuation, etc.).
- [ ] Check that all slides look good on the projector and on NDI.
- [ ] Check that the walk-in slides have their "Go to Next Timer" set to five seconds and that the last one loops back to the beginning.
- [ ] Check that the MC announcement slides do _not_ have a "Go to Next Timer."
- [ ] Check that the verses have the right translation.
- [ ] Check that lyrics slides have the hotkeys set up properly (e.g., the hotkey for the first verse should be on the first lyrics slide, not on the media slide).
- [ ] If you have time, remove walk-in slides and MC announcements that are definitely outdated.
- [ ] Check that the red light is off and the stage lights are on.
- [ ] Once the rehearsal is done, play each video to make sure the sound is working.
- [ ] Check that the screens are level and that the projectors are lined up properly.

## Start

- [ ] Play some music from Spotify.
- [ ] Show the walk-in slides.
- [ ] Turn on NDI Video Monitor and select NDI > Desktop-D9Q3BCP > vMix - Output 1.

## General Reminders

- Control the lights:
    - Lower MASTER LEVEL to 0 when a video is played and raise it back to 10 afterwards.
    - Lower CROSSFADERS Y to about 5 when the speaker reads scripture and raise it back to 10 afterwards.
- If the speaker goes over time, flash the red light a few times and then leave it on.
