# FOH Setup Checklist

For more details, see the [ProPresenter quick start guide](https://github.com/recc-tech/tech/wiki/ProPresenter-Quick-Start-Guide).

## During Rehearsal

- Set up the standard playlist elements:
    - [ ] Walk-in slides and announcements
    - [ ] Videos (opener, bumper, announcements)
    - [ ] Songs
    - [ ] Message
- [ ] Make sure the projectors are lined up well and in focus.
- [ ] Check that all the images and videos on Planning Center are in ProPresenter.
- [ ] In ProPresenter, remove walk-in slides and announcement slides that are definitely outdated.
- [ ] For each slide, make sure you use the correct look:
    - "Lyrics" for song lyrics
    - "Scripture" for Bible verses
    - "Message" for the sermon notes
    - "No NDI" otherwise, especially for slides like the lyrics backgrounds that are likely to be used immediately after lyrics.
- [ ] Make sure the walk-in slides all have their "Go to Next Timer" set and the other slides do not have a timer.
    - For slides with a QR code, set the "Go to Next Timer" to 8 seconds.
    - Otherwise, set the "Go to Next Timer" to 5 seconds.
- [ ] Look for special events in the plan on Planning Center Online (e.g., baptism, child dedication).
- Look for special requests or notes (e.g., custom lyrics, scripture to be shown before worship):
    - [ ] On Planning Center
    - [ ] By email (tech@riversedge.life)

### (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Check that the message notes are up to date (in case some last-minute changes were made).
- [ ] Check that all slides look good on the projector and on NDI (e.g., the text isn't too small).
- [ ] Check that all the songs are correct (in case the wrong CCLI number was provided).
    - For example, check the sheet music.
- [ ] In the `ProPresenter Assets` directory, archive outdated files.

## After Rehearsal

- [ ] Play each video to make sure the sound is working.
- [ ] Turn down the red light and the stage lights.
- [ ] Play some music from Spotify.
- [ ] Show the walk-in slides.
- [ ] Turn on NDI Video Monitor and select NDI > Desktop-D9Q3BCP > vMix - Output 1.
- [ ] Go to the "Services Live" view on Planning Center.

## General Reminders

- Lower MASTER LEVEL to 0 when a video is played and raise it back to 10 afterwards.
