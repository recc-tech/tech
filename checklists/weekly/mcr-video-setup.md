# MCR Setup Checklist

## Essentials

- [ ] The events are properly set up on Church Online Platform and on BoxCast.
- [ ] Sound is working and cameras are responsive.
- [ ] The Kids Connection playlist for this week is ready.
- [ ] Titles are up to date in vMix.
- [ ] All videos and loops have been restarted.
- [ ] The sermon notes are published to Church Online Platform.
- [ ] The tech for the kids is set up in the Annex (*including the laptop charger!*).

## Nice-To-Have

- [ ] Other assets (e.g., announcements, bumper videos) are imported into vMix in case they can't be sent from the FOH station.
- [ ] Backup slides for the message notes and Bible verses are ready in vMix in case they can't be sent from the FOH station.

## General Reminders

- At each scene change (e.g., from worship to announcements):
    - Put up the person's title up
    - Check the sound level
- Keep an eye on the time. If the service is still going at around 11:50, you may need to extend the stream time on BoxCast and Church Online Platform.
