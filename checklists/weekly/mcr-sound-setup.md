# MCR Sound Setup Checklist

## Power Up

The following must be turned on first.

- [ ] FOH sound board
- [ ] Stage box

Then, turn on the MCR sound station.

- [ ] Power on the sound board below the monitor (M32C)
- [ ] Power on the PC and launch the "M32 Edit" app.

## Initial Check

- [ ] Unmute and raise faders for channels that are being used.
- [ ] Mute and lower faders to -oo for channels that are *not* in use (to reduce visual clutter).
- [ ] Check that the input gain (trim) is as expected for each unmuted channel.
  - The expected level is generally -20 to -10 dB, although it depends on the instrument.
    - e.g., the bass tends to be pretty steady, so the trim should be in that range.
    - e.g., the keys can vary a lot depending on how hard the pianist is playing, so you should be a bit more permissive.
- [ ] Check that the channels (especially for speakers and vocalists) are assigned to the right DCA and have the right effects.
