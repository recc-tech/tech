# FOH Video Setup

## Setup

- [ ] Copy the previous week's playlist and rename it.
- [ ] Download any new media from Planning Center Online.
- [ ] Set up the playlist according to the plan on Planning Center Online.

## Checks

- [ ] Check that all slides have the correct look (lyrics, scripture, message notes).
- [ ] Check that the walk-in slides have their "Go to Next Timer" set to five seconds and that the last one loops back to the beginning.
- [ ] Check that the MC announcement slides do _not_ have a "Go to Next Timer."
- [ ] Once the rehearsal is done, play each video to make sure the sound is working.

## General Reminders

- Lower the lights when a video is played and raise them again afterwards
