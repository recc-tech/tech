# FOH Video Setup

For more details, see the [ProPresenter quick start guide](https://github.com/recc-tech/tech/wiki/ProPresenter-Quick-Start-Guide).

## Setup

- [ ] Copy the previous week's playlist and rename it.
- [ ] Download any new media from Planning Center Online.
- [ ] Set up the playlist according to the plan on Planning Center Online.
    - [ ] Walk-in slides
    - [ ] Videos
    - [ ] MC welcome, announcements, and goodbye slides
    - [ ] Worship and reprise
    - [ ] Message

## Checks

- [ ] Check that all slides have the correct look (lyrics, scripture, message notes).
- [ ] Check that the walk-in slides have their "Go to Next Timer" set to five seconds and that the last one loops back to the beginning.
- [ ] Check that the MC announcement slides do _not_ have a "Go to Next Timer."
- [ ] Once the rehearsal is done, play each video to make sure the sound is working.

## General Reminders

- Lower the lights when a video is played and raise them again afterwards.
- If the speaker goes over time, flash the red light a few times and then leave it on.
