# vMix
- [ ] Open last week's preset
- [ ] Turn on both monitors and turn on the external output
    - You may need to turn off the external output and turn it back on if it doesn't work the first time
- [ ] Update titles
- [ ] Import videos and close the previous week's kids video
    - You can drag the videos directly from File Explorer into the "Videos" category
- Set up and test triggers for kids countdown and video
    - [ ] Set up a trigger on the kids countdown loop that fades to the kids video for this week
    - [ ] Set up a trigger on the kids video that fades to the pre-stream title loop
    - [ ] Test the triggers by playing the countdown loop (skip to a few seconds before the end)
    - Once the triggers are set up and tested, you'll be able to set up the kids tech while the videos are being broadcast
- [ ] Restart all videos and loops
    - Do this _after_ testing the triggers so that you don't forget to reset those videos
- [ ] Check cameras and frame shots
- [ ] Check sound
    - If there is no sound:
        - Check that the sound station is sending sound (look at the LR level)
        - Reset the "Audio IN 1-2" input
        - Unplug the sound USB cable and plug it back in

# Kids AV
- [ ] Copy the kids video to the laptop's Desktop
    - You can use the USB from the MCR sound station. Put the USB back at the sound station when you're done.
- [ ] Once the kids broadcast starts, bring the equipment to the Annex
    - As of 2022/08/21, the Kids Connection gathering takes place upstairs, in the first room on the left
- [ ] Set up the laptop, screen, projector, and speakers
    - On the old Dell Latitude, you should be able to log in to the account `David Reader` without a password.
    - On the old Dell Inspiron, use the account `Tech`. The password should be written on a sticky note on the laptop. If for some reason you need the security questions, the answers are all "Montreal".
