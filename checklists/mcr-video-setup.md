# MCR Setup Checklist

## Planning Center Online
- [ ] Download kids video
- [ ] Download sermon notes (if they're present)
- [ ] Move the downloaded files to `D:\Users\Tech\Documents\vMix Assets\By Service\YYYY-MM-DD`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date

## Church Online Platform
- [ ] Copy the sermon notes to the event (if they were on Planning Center Online)
    > :warning: Pay attention to the "Additional Services" section at the end.
    > - For the main event, uncheck every other service.
    > - For the rebroadcasts, check all the other rebroadcasts on the same date but uncheck everything else.
- [ ] Check that all the services have been created and have content

## BoxCast
- _NOTE:_ If you are asked to log in, you may need to refresh the page first
- [ ] Check that the events have been created

## vMix
- [ ] Open last week's preset
- [ ] Turn on both monitors and turn on the external output
    - You may need to turn off the external output and turn it back on if it doesn't work the first time
- [ ] Import videos and close the previous week's kids video
    - You can drag the videos directly from File Explorer into the "Videos" category
- Set up and test triggers for kids countdown and video
    - [ ] Set up a trigger on the kids countdown loop that fades to the kids video for this week
    - [ ] Set up a trigger on the kids video that fades to the pre-stream title loop
    - [ ] Test the triggers by playing the countdown loop (skip to a few seconds before the end)
    - Once the triggers are set up and tested, you'll be able to set up the kids tech while the videos are being broadcast
- [ ] Restart all videos and loops
    - Do this _after_ testing the triggers so that you don't forget to reset those videos
- Update titles
    - [ ] Pre-stream title
    - [ ] Host
    - [ ] Speaker
    - [ ] Special announcer(s), if any
    - [ ] Check that all the titles and the pre-stream title loop look good
- [ ] Save preset as a new file
    - Click "Save As"
    - Name the file `YYYY-MM-DD Live.vmix`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date
- [ ] Check cameras and frame shots
    - [ ] If any of the band members are in a bad position (e.g., blocking someone else), let them know
- [ ] Once it's time for the Kids Connection broadcast, mute other sounds (LR on the sound computer and the NDI source), play the 5 minute countdown _and start the stream_. Check on Church Online Platform that the stream is working.
- [ ] Check sound
    - If there is no sound:
        - Check that the sound station is sending sound (look at the LR level)
        - Reset the "Audio IN 1-2" input
        - Unplug the sound USB cable and plug it back in
- [ ] After the Kids Connection broadcast, start recording

## Kids AV
- [ ] Copy the kids video to the laptop's Desktop
    - You can use the USB from the MCR sound station. Put the USB back at the sound station when you're done.
- [ ] Once the kids broadcast starts, bring the equipment to the Annex
    - As of 2023/02/26, the Kids Connection gathering takes place upstairs, in the second room on the left
- [ ] Set up the laptop and TV
    - On the old Dell Latitude, you should be able to log in to the account `David Reader` without a password.
    - On the old Dell Inspiron, use the account `Tech`. The password should be written on a sticky note on the laptop. If for some reason you need the security questions, the answers are all "Montreal".

## General Reminders
- At each scene change (e.g., from worship to announcements):
    - Put up the person's title up
    - Check the sound level
