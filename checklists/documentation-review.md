# Documentation Review Checklist

Documentation risks becoming outdated if we don't maintain it. Below is a checklist for reviewing the documentation and weekly checklists.

## For Each Article in the Wiki

Check that:

- [ ] All the information is still accurate and relevant.
- [ ] No important information is missing.
- [ ] All screenshots are up to date (esp. UI screenshots).
- [ ] All hyperlinks are still working.

If applicable, add any new information to the articles.

## For Each Weekly Checklist

Check that:

- [ ] All the information is still accurate and reflects current practices (not what we'd _like_ to do).
- [ ] No steps are missing.
- [ ] All hyperlinks are still working.

## For This Checklist

- [ ] If you found any documentation issues not listed above, update this checklist so that we remember to look for that in the future.
