# Documentation Review Checklist

Documentation can become outdated if we don't maintain it. Below is a checklist for reviewing the documentation and weekly checklists.

## For Each Article in the Wiki

Check that:

- [ ] All the information is still accurate, relevant, and consistent with current practices (not what we'd _like_ to do).
- [ ] No important information is missing.
- [ ] All hyperlinks are still working.
- [ ] All screenshots are up to date (esp. UI screenshots).

## For Each Weekly Checklist

Check that:

- [ ] All the information is still accurate, relevant, and consistent with current practices (not what we'd _like_ to do).
- [ ] No steps are missing.
- [ ] All hyperlinks are still working.

## For This Checklist

- [ ] If you found any documentation issues not listed above, update this checklist so that we remember to look for that in the future.
