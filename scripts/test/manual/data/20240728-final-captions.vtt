00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:25.269
Lord, you invited all who are weary to come to you for rest. Today, I come to you for that rest.

NOTE confidence=0.997

2
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:37.989
I bring you the heavy burden of work, the tasks that are incomplete, the plans I want to keep

NOTE confidence=0.996

3
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.390
thinking through and the deadlines that are quickly approaching.

NOTE confidence=0.996

4
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:56.450
I'm tempted to believe that my worth is in my accomplishments. Remind me that I am a valued child of

NOTE confidence=0.999

5
00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:59.649
God based on the work of Christ.

NOTE confidence=0.996

6
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:12.049
And I'm tempted to believe that my security is in my possessions. Remind me of the greater and truer

NOTE confidence=0.998

7
00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:15.350
inheritance that is kept in heaven for me.

NOTE confidence=0.965

8
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:27.369
And on this day of rest help me to slow down, calm my restless heart and anxious thoughts.

NOTE confidence=0.996

9
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:39.528
And on this day of rest help me to enjoy your creation, not as a tool for my productivity, but as a

NOTE confidence=0.705

10
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:50.250
gift to delight in. And on this day of rest above all else help me to be aware of your presence with

NOTE confidence=0.999

11
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.530
me.

NOTE confidence=0.998

12
00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:57.599
You are the one who created this world and placed me in it

NOTE confidence=0.998

13
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:12.429
and you are the one who said it is finished. The work is complete and you are the one who now

NOTE confidence=0.99

14
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.349
invites me into the rest that Christ earned for me.

NOTE confidence=0.998

15
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.330
So help me to enter that rest today.

NOTE confidence=0.996

16
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:45.590
Welcome everyone. We're super excited to worship together. We're just gonna praise him, praise our

NOTE confidence=0.993

17
00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:50.929
way through. Um whatever you came in with, he's here and he loves you. So we're just gonna lay it

NOTE confidence=0.757

18
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:59.289
down. So let's go. Who feel free to shake it off. Whatever you came in with.

NOTE confidence=0.942

19
00:14:57.739 --> 00:15:02.690
right now that you would just cover this room with your love, cover this room with your grace, your

NOTE confidence=0.996

20
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.429
mercy, your peace, whatever the heart in this room needs. You know what it is. I pray that they

NOTE confidence=1.0

21
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.650
would feel it, that they would experience it, that it would be tangible. That dry bones would come to

NOTE confidence=0.517

22
00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:17.190
life in their heart, in their mind and their spirit and their soul. Lord, we love you, we lift you

NOTE confidence=0.996

23
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.840
up as we praise you and you know what? We need and praise is the password for us to just lift, take

NOTE confidence=1.0

24
00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:29.250
yours and your burden is light. We're gonna sing this again. You make all things work together.

NOTE confidence=1.0

25
00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:33.160
Good morning, River's Edge.

NOTE confidence=1.0

26
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:46.849
I guess, I think maybe better. Welcome to the River's Edge. My name is Chris. I'm Amadea.

NOTE confidence=1.0

27
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:24.459
Oh. Ok, I'll give it a minute. So I understand too because I'm on the sound

NOTE confidence=1.0

28
00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:29.219
team. So you guys are doing great. They, they are A+.

NOTE confidence=1.0

29
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:40.109
So, yeah, sorry. I, I'm always a little bit more stressed. We are so blessed to have you here in

NOTE confidence=0.996

30
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:49.089
person. Um We welcome you warmly. We are here to work together um to build each other up and work

NOTE confidence=0.81

31
00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:52.420
towards an auth, authentic life of faith, love and hope,

NOTE confidence=0.709

32
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.540
right?

NOTE confidence=0.795

33
00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:18.030
Amen. I, I'm dressed for it

NOTE confidence=0.654

34
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:30.739
and we know that winter is coming. So as Canadians, we love summertime. So it's a blessing. God is

NOTE confidence=0.563

35
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:38.130
blessing us, right? Amen. Amen. Uh We have a wonderful gathering plan for you. Um We're today, we're

NOTE confidence=0.996

36
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:45.489
continuing the series called Relax and the message is rest through connection. Um We also want to

NOTE confidence=0.511

37
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:52.689
talk to you about um how we can reveal faith uh and bring God's blessing in our lives. Uh And that's

NOTE confidence=0.942

38
00:19:52.699 --> 00:20:00.479
through generosity. Yes. And so we're gonna take a time to read from God's Word. Um And the passage

NOTE confidence=0.732

39
00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:11.619
that I've chosen for today is from Matthew 14 um verses 15 to 21. And it says, as e as evening

NOTE confidence=0.943

40
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:18.300
approached, the disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place and it's already getting late,

NOTE confidence=0.997

41
00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:24.890
send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food. And Jesus replied,

NOTE confidence=0.996

42
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:32.640
they do not need to go away. You give them something to eat. We only have five loaves of bread and

NOTE confidence=0.999

43
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:38.880
two fish. They answered, bring them here to me. He said, and he directed the people to sit down on

NOTE confidence=0.996

44
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:44.920
the grass, taking the five loaves and two fish and looking up to heaven. He gave thanks and broke

NOTE confidence=0.995

45
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:50.449
the loaves and then he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people and they

NOTE confidence=0.87

46
00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:57.329
all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up 12 basket fulls of broken pieces that were

NOTE confidence=0.996

47
00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:05.640
left over. The number of those who ate was about 5000 men besides women and Children. Yeah.

NOTE confidence=0.995

48
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:11.489
Incredible. Right. So the last time I spoke on this topic, we pulled out a few points. We pulled out

NOTE confidence=0.997

49
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:18.469
that Jesus gave thanks first before he multiplied, he called the disciples to go out and to feed the

NOTE confidence=0.904

50
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:25.010
people and that's us and that he provided in excess. Those were the points. But I wanna actually

NOTE confidence=0.983

51
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:32.229
highlight another point from this passage today that it was from the disciples generosity with what

NOTE confidence=0.997

52
00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:40.869
little they felt they had that created a space for an entire group of people. Over 5000 people to

NOTE confidence=0.996

53
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:52.869
stay and hear God speak. They created a community through their generosity with, with the purpose of

NOTE confidence=0.996

54
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.010
allowing people literally to sit at the feet of Jesus and to hear His word. And that is what we are

NOTE confidence=0.996

55
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:06.089
called to do. It was the disciples that had to move in that generosity. They were already a part of

NOTE confidence=0.538

56
00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:13.530
Jesus's crew. So we're speaking to the community of Rivers Edge today. If you consider yourself part

NOTE confidence=0.989

57
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:22.170
of the community, there's a call on us to be generous with what we feel we might be lacking even.

NOTE confidence=0.474

58
00:22:22.489 --> 00:22:29.569
And I want to point out that God did this with the leftovers from their day, the left over of their

NOTE confidence=0.934

59
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:37.359
lunch, not even their first fruits which we are called to give. So imagine what we are capable of

NOTE confidence=0.989

60
00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:45.270
outside of our own community with the generosity that God calls us to have. We're meant to call on

NOTE confidence=0.99

61
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.020
the community outside of these doors. We're meant to touch people and to glue them into this

NOTE confidence=0.524

62
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:58.689
community at the foot of Jesus. And so we have multiple ways to give. There is e transfers. There

NOTE confidence=0.996

63
00:22:58.699 --> 00:23:06.099
are the kiosks at the back. Um You can scan the QR code, there is a mandate on this community and

NOTE confidence=0.996

64
00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:12.739
God wants to do exceedingly more than we can imagine with our generosity. And so with that, we're

NOTE confidence=0.742

65
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:19.760
gonna pray over it. Let let's take the opportunity to pray together. It's our prayer that uh that

NOTE confidence=0.924

66
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:25.359
brings uh that God brings breakthroughs through and meaningful moments for the rest of our lives in

NOTE confidence=0.971

67
00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:34.760
this season. Um So let's pray, Father God, we're all here for a purpose. You didn't lead us here by

NOTE confidence=0.996

68
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:40.800
accidents, whether we're watching online or here in person. We've come with a lot of burdens. We've

NOTE confidence=0.83

69
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.989
come with a lot of, you know, heavy things that we're, we're going through in our lives. But you've

NOTE confidence=0.864

70
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.060
brought us here because you wanna fill us with rest. You wanna fill us with your peace and your love.

NOTE confidence=0.995

71
00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:57.979
I pray over the community here and online, whatever they're going through whatever life is throwing

NOTE confidence=0.907

72
00:23:57.989 --> 00:24:03.500
at them. Um You're always gonna be there. You have always been there. You are our source of strength

NOTE confidence=0.979

73
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:11.180
and our source of peace. Um I pray over everyone and I pray over the gathering and um may your name

NOTE confidence=0.93

74
00:24:11.189 --> 00:24:17.959
be lifted high and that uh we may bring everything that we have, which is just a, a pray a

NOTE confidence=0.845

75
00:24:17.969 --> 00:24:23.599
hallelujah to you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

NOTE confidence=1.0

76
00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:36.099
Our God is so great. The splendor of the king clothed the majesty. Let all the earth rejoice. How

NOTE confidence=1.0

77
00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:39.839
great is our God. And let's sing this beautiful song. It's beautiful.

NOTE confidence=1.0

78
00:43:45.949 --> 00:43:55.870
Hey everybody So good to be with you. You guys are you happy? You're here too. Is it just me? Yeah. You

NOTE confidence=0.995

79
00:43:55.879 --> 00:44:01.879
know one of the things about uh understanding rest is about understanding how it can work best for

NOTE confidence=0.831

80
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:10.419
us. And yet God gives us some pretty clear principles on how it can work, right? But not all of us

NOTE confidence=0.957

81
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:19.419
take rests in the same way, not all of us enjoy rest the same way. Some of us have preferences and

NOTE confidence=0.996

82
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:30.399
we prefer people with whom we can find rest with. But what if rest isn't found in activity? Nor is

NOTE confidence=0.996

83
00:44:30.409 --> 00:44:39.199
it found in inactivity? Have you found that when we are lazy, we can sometimes actually find

NOTE confidence=0.991

84
00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:49.000
ourselves still lacking rest. Have you found that when you actually go to take a rest, you come back

NOTE confidence=0.996

85
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:58.620
and you found and discover that you're still not rested. And that's because rest isn't found in the

NOTE confidence=0.996

86
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:09.939
things that we are driven to experience. But it's rather driven towards an experience with the one

NOTE confidence=0.831

87
00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:18.729
who created and established rest in the first place. And when we understand that it redefines our

NOTE confidence=0.997

88
00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:30.239
understanding, but also in how we experience rest. God gives us an opportunity to have time every

NOTE confidence=0.996

89
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:37.149
day. We have time every day, we have minutes that turn into days, that turn into weeks and look at

NOTE confidence=0.954

90
00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:44.639
us already halfway through the year. And sometimes when we look at where we're at, we can sometimes

NOTE confidence=0.996

91
00:45:44.649 --> 00:45:53.379
feel accomplished, we've done what we set out to do. And other times we look back and we say I'm

NOTE confidence=0.996

92
00:45:53.389 --> 00:46:02.770
actually still so far behind in achieving and accomplishing the things that I set out for myself. At

NOTE confidence=0.999

93
00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:11.429
the beginning of the year, we sometimes find ourselves in this constant struggle of either being

NOTE confidence=0.997

94
00:46:11.439 --> 00:46:24.389
affirmed or in many ways diminished, diminished by ourselves, diminished by others, sometimes given

NOTE confidence=0.99

95
00:46:24.399 --> 00:46:33.649
a task. But we can't seem to muster the energy to actually accomplish it, fulfill it. And even bring

NOTE confidence=0.996

96
00:46:34.169 --> 00:46:46.159
it to the deadline that was given to us a deadline that was external. One that was internal. Either

NOTE confidence=0.997

97
00:46:46.169 --> 00:46:56.590
way we find ourselves struggling to experience rest. We sometimes talk to people and they say I find

NOTE confidence=0.997

98
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:09.159
rest in nature. I find rest in movies. I find rest in reading books. I find rest with having deep

NOTE confidence=0.997

99
00:47:09.169 --> 00:47:17.739
and meaningful conversations. I find rest when I'm with family. I find rest when I'm far, far away

NOTE confidence=0.634

100
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:26.729
from family, I find rest when I'm on vacation. Um, I find rest when I'm away from work. I find rest.

NOTE confidence=0.997

101
00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:38.110
Actually when I'm working, going to the office or going away from home gives me rest. And the more I

NOTE confidence=0.997

102
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:46.010
talk to people and the more I realize everyone has a very different rhythm, understanding and

NOTE confidence=0.996

103
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:53.750
experience of how to achieve rest. I rest most when I'm in the gym, I rest most when I'm eating, I

NOTE confidence=0.997

104
00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:05.860
rest most when I'm sleeping, when I'm napping. When I'm just finding nothing at all to do whatever

NOTE confidence=0.996

105
00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:16.929
we do. Many of us have come to understand this truth. No matter how much rust we take, we still are

NOTE confidence=0.98

106
00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:24.850
far from experience again. Is it possible that what we lack is not time, not interests, not hobbies,

NOTE confidence=0.65

107
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:36.659
not friends, not family. Is it possible that what we lack is actually a true understanding of rest

NOTE confidence=0.9864999999999999

108
00:48:37.629 --> 00:48:46.669
that what we perceive to be rest actually causes more unrest. II, I see people who work four hours

NOTE confidence=0.996

109
00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:56.800
consecutively and then find themselves exhausted. Just like I see someone who can play video games

NOTE confidence=0.997

110
00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:06.959
for four hours continuously and also not find rest. You see both are seeking rest, both are seeking

NOTE confidence=0.892

111
00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:16.479
what the scriptures called. Shalom, what the scriptures call. Rest both are trying to find it in

NOTE confidence=0.971

112
00:49:16.489 --> 00:49:26.919
their activity and in their inactivity, but neither are rest. Both are actually unrest because God

NOTE confidence=0.996

113
00:49:26.929 --> 00:49:33.179
established a rhythm for us to follow. And the interesting thing about our work and our rest is that

NOTE confidence=0.997

114
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:39.780
when God created in the book of Genesis, when we see the sequence of days, he says there was evening

NOTE confidence=0.996

115
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:50.729
and then there was morning and he says this was the first day. This was the first day. What God does

NOTE confidence=0.952

116
00:49:50.739 --> 00:49:59.280
is that God rests in preparation for the next day. I don't know about you, but I often do not do

NOTE confidence=0.8445

117
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:11.810
that. II I have this rhythm of rest that sometimes I, I try to find rest by actually finding myself

NOTE confidence=0.981

118
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:20.260
staying up doing other things, being tired in a different way. And instead of finding and

NOTE confidence=0.996

119
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:30.560
experiencing rest, I find myself still far from it. Why? Because my ceasing from activity has just

NOTE confidence=0.996

120
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:38.320
continued into the evening, anyone else and then we're up, we're not sleeping, we're not resting and

NOTE confidence=0.932

121
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:44.669
we're drained and we're incapable of facing the next day. And so Jesus says, I want you to

NOTE confidence=0.995

122
00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:52.790
understand that when I become your rest, I'm gonna show you and help you to experience a new way to

NOTE confidence=0.996

123
00:50:52.800 --> 00:51:00.860
have this. But before we can get to Jesus, we have to understand how God established this pattern in

NOTE confidence=0.977

124
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:11.590
the first place. And so we see in creation that on humanity's very first full day they rested. God

NOTE confidence=0.564

125
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:19.469
tells them I want you to rest. Why? Because it's important for God. So therefore, it must be

NOTE confidence=0.996

126
00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:28.189
important for us. God sets the example by resting so that we understand that on our first day alive,

NOTE confidence=0.993

127
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:36.899
it's supposed to be a day of rest. We're supposed to enter into a new understanding of rest. God

NOTE confidence=0.996

128
00:51:36.909 --> 00:51:44.750
says, I want you to prioritize it. It's interesting because I don't prioritize rest. I uh prioritize

NOTE confidence=0.859

129
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:53.860
accomplishments. I prioritize getting things done. I, I prioritize doing things that bring

NOTE confidence=0.951

130
00:51:53.870 --> 00:52:01.139
fulfillment to me without realizing that what they're in essence doing is still draining me. But

NOTE confidence=0.996

131
00:52:01.149 --> 00:52:08.600
when God asks me to prioritize rest, he's actually asking me to do something different. So when we

NOTE confidence=0.972

132
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:18.149
talk about having connection with things that give us rest, maybe God doesn't even come onto the

NOTE confidence=0.974

133
00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:26.419
list that we have in our mind of how we experience rest. Maybe spending time with God isn't how we

NOTE confidence=0.996

134
00:52:26.429 --> 00:52:36.379
would envision or imagine what it looks like to have rest. And so in Exodus chapter 20 take a look

NOTE confidence=0.996

135
00:52:36.389 --> 00:52:46.379
at verse eight to verse 11, we receive this commandment and it says, observe the Sabbath day by

NOTE confidence=0.997

136
00:52:46.389 --> 00:52:54.909
keeping it holy. And what God wants us to understand is that the day of rest is a blessed day and it

NOTE confidence=0.997

137
00:52:54.919 --> 00:53:03.750
is a holy day. It is a blessed day and it is a holy day because from the very nature of God, he

NOTE confidence=0.998

138
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:12.040
introduces us to rest and therefore commands us to experience that rest. And when we experience rest

NOTE confidence=0.994

139
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:20.080
his way, well, then that day becomes a date in which is blessed and holy for us. It isn't in the

NOTE confidence=0.997

140
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:31.080
observance of the Sabbath, the way that we would just simply observe any other act or activity and

NOTE confidence=0.997

141
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:42.260
make it an act or an activity that requires us to do something. But it is rather one that helps us

NOTE confidence=0.998

142
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:52.780
to have the correct understanding, the correct openness of mind, the correct way of viewing rest

NOTE confidence=0.998

143
00:53:53.229 --> 00:54:02.280
through practice that enables us to have a connection that we otherwise would not have with God and

NOTE confidence=0.996

144
00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:11.439
His creation. So God wants us to understand that in this passage, we are to keep it holy. In other

NOTE confidence=0.997

145
00:54:11.449 --> 00:54:18.689
words, you are to prioritize it. It means in the light of everything else that is busy and about

NOTE confidence=0.883

146
00:54:18.699 --> 00:54:26.219
activity. God is saying I still want you to take that rest because if you go out and labor on a day

NOTE confidence=0.979

147
00:54:26.229 --> 00:54:30.149
in which you're supposed to be resting, I want you to know you're not gonna achieve more, you're

NOTE confidence=0.945

148
00:54:30.159 --> 00:54:36.270
actually gonna achieve less. You're not gonna accomplish more, you will accomplish less, you're not

NOTE confidence=0.996

149
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.560
gonna harvest more, you're not gonna harvest anything at all. I promise you if you go out on the

NOTE confidence=0.996

150
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:47.780
seventh day, if you do not take the rest, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna have less. Not

NOTE confidence=0.999

151
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.139
more.

NOTE confidence=0.996

152
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:57.580
Now, if we understand this, then we begin to understand that my activity isn't what prospers me. It

NOTE confidence=0.996

153
00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:04.760
is my observance of what he declares to be blessed and holy. If I observe what God says is blessed

NOTE confidence=0.864

154
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:15.070
and holy, then what happens is that I experience blessing and I experienced his holiness. I have a

NOTE confidence=0.996

155
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:26.780
connection that now is not going to be severed because I have created a rhythm of work and rest that

NOTE confidence=0.997

156
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:34.250
God is able to honor. In verse nine. He says, you have six days each week for your ordinary work.

NOTE confidence=0.991

157
00:55:35.949 --> 00:55:44.360
Six days. He's saying I want you to do this six days. I don't want you to add 1/7. I want you to

NOTE confidence=0.997

158
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:52.270
begin to discipline yourself to understand that I didn't do this so that you could just work seven

NOTE confidence=0.992

159
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:59.949
days. I did this so that you would understand that you have to insert that day of rest. It isn't

NOTE confidence=0.989

160
00:55:59.959 --> 00:56:05.459
something that is optional. It's something that I command. It is not something that you can just

NOTE confidence=0.996

161
00:56:05.469 --> 00:56:08.860
choose to avoid, you must obey.

NOTE confidence=0.996

162
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:17.320
And it's hard for us to do that in our society. I think we're just so accustomed to always being

NOTE confidence=0.997

163
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:24.489
active that we don't even know what this looks like. You see, even when I'm lazy, even when I'm

NOTE confidence=0.997

164
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:31.439
inactive, I could be filling up a day and not resting the way that God wants me to do. You guys get

NOTE confidence=0.996

165
00:56:31.449 --> 00:56:40.540
that? See, it isn't because I stopped working. It's because I actually am not resting the way that

NOTE confidence=0.831

166
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:49.169
he tells me to. Now, we're still in this hybrid thing with work and, um, maybe we'll never go back

NOTE confidence=0.945

167
00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:54.429
to a full office thing. And a lot of people say, you know, when I'm at the office, I just take

NOTE confidence=0.987

168
00:56:54.439 --> 00:57:01.610
longer lunches anyways and I talk even more at the water cooler and take more breaks in people's

NOTE confidence=0.943

169
00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:09.449
cubicles. And I don't actually get more done at work probably about the same. So if I'm supposed to

NOTE confidence=0.994

170
00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:15.189
be there for eight hours, I only actually work five, whether I'm at home or whether I'm at work,

NOTE confidence=0.99

171
00:57:15.199 --> 00:57:20.310
it's about the same. And I've had a lot of honest conversations with people and this is what I keep

NOTE confidence=0.937

172
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:26.679
hearing. Sometimes they say actually get more done at home because there's so many distractions at

NOTE confidence=0.766

173
00:57:26.689 --> 00:57:31.209
work. Some people say the opposite. I can't get anything done at home because there's so many

NOTE confidence=0.876

174
00:57:31.219 --> 00:57:39.100
distractions that I need to go to work. And what I've come to understand is that our system is not

NOTE confidence=0.585

175
00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.250
going to provide rest.

NOTE confidence=0.996

176
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.040
The only thing that can provide rest if we do things God's way

NOTE confidence=0.98

177
00:57:48.239 --> 00:57:56.399
and if you wanna see effectiveness really realized in your life, obey God more. And you will see

NOTE confidence=0.998

178
00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:02.639
that when you work for Jesus, when you work for the Lord, when you work to honor God, when he

NOTE confidence=0.997

179
00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:10.090
becomes your employer in all things, and the reason through which you work and rest your life is

NOTE confidence=0.996

180
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.139
truly blessed and holy.

NOTE confidence=0.996

181
00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:22.169
And I believe that God recompenses you. He rewards you. He renews you refreshes you. He replenishes

NOTE confidence=0.996

182
00:58:22.179 --> 00:58:31.360
you. He does all the things that you need him to do when we seek out what it looks like to relax his

NOTE confidence=0.9895

183
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:40.239
way. Look at what it says in verse 10, but the seventh day, well, this is 1/7 day that he says it

NOTE confidence=0.995

184
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:46.489
has to be dedicated to the Lord. Now, what we get from this is that it is a day that is supposed to

NOTE confidence=0.999

185
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.439
be about God.

NOTE confidence=0.462

186
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:58.129
And that means like if I go out and I don't know, I'm on a terrace in old Montreal, sipping a drink

NOTE confidence=0.996

187
00:58:58.139 --> 00:59:04.969
and talking with friends and experiencing rest. I want you to understand if I'm not connecting with

NOTE confidence=0.789

188
00:59:04.979 --> 00:59:16.199
God and if it isn't dedicated to God, that's not rest. That's just leisure. It's a pleasure if, if I

NOTE confidence=0.984

189
00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:23.320
am at the cottage and I'm sitting in an Adirondack chair and I'm facing the lake and I'm drinking a

NOTE confidence=0.996

190
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:28.139
beverage, any beverage I want. And maybe more than one.

NOTE confidence=0.981

191
00:59:33.649 --> 00:59:40.030
And I decide that this is the way that I'm going to rest. But I have no thoughts of God and very

NOTE confidence=0.996

192
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:48.209
little my time. My day, my moment, I'm enjoying creation, but I am not connected to the creator it

NOTE confidence=0.996

193
00:59:48.219 --> 00:59:49.149
is not rest.

NOTE confidence=0.996

194
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:59.090
You see my activity or my inactivity has nothing to do with rest. It actually has everything to do

NOTE confidence=0.996

195
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:07.110
with what I am doing in that moment of rest. And how that is either connected to God or disconnected

NOTE confidence=0.997

196
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:15.639
from Him. Is it dedicated to the Lord or not? So I can meet with someone have conversations, but

NOTE confidence=0.996

197
01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:20.870
they have to be conversations about God that bring me closer to an experience with God. Does that

NOTE confidence=0.996

198
01:00:20.879 --> 01:00:28.510
make sense? Then I retreat and I find personal time and I keep relating and connecting with God. And

NOTE confidence=0.998

199
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.840
I do that through worship and through prayer. And I do that through words and I do that through the

NOTE confidence=0.996

200
01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:40.159
conversations that I've had and I find myself connected to God. Sometimes I just sit in silence and

NOTE confidence=0.971

201
01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:46.169
I let God just speak to me any way that He wants and sometimes in that silence, he says nothing at

NOTE confidence=0.698

202
01:00:46.179 --> 01:00:53.239
all. But I feel connected to God. He doesn't need to speak just like I prefer it sometimes when my

NOTE confidence=0.997

203
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.870
wife next to me doesn't speak,

NOTE confidence=0.996

204
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:04.889
I love her next to me. I love her presence with me. I love being and doing life with her. But I

NOTE confidence=0.997

205
01:01:04.899 --> 01:01:06.379
don't always need her to be talking

NOTE confidence=0.985

206
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:15.510
just like I don't always need to be talking to her. Does that make sense? Say yes and then you have

NOTE confidence=0.996

207
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.909
to deal with her later. And,

NOTE confidence=0.552

208
01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:29.590
but I think you know what I mean? Sometimes when we practice the presence, it is more meaningful

NOTE confidence=0.996

209
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:37.320
than any words that can be shared. There is a threshold of intimacy there that can be crossed and

NOTE confidence=0.959

210
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:49.250
experienced that goes beyond words, but is seen in the trust and experience in the provision, in the

NOTE confidence=0.982

211
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:58.260
care and in the comfort of being with someone who's got your back. And when we experience that with

NOTE confidence=0.987

212
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:07.800
God, God is saying, do you trust me that much that you can stop from all of your activity and rest

NOTE confidence=0.66

213
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:16.520
and connect with me? Let's think about that. What does that day of rest look like for you? And

NOTE confidence=0.962

214
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:22.719
that's interesting because I think when I engage in activities, sometimes I don't know about you,

NOTE confidence=0.976

215
01:02:22.729 --> 01:02:33.280
but it can sometimes lead me into greater temptation just like sometimes by inactivity leads me into

NOTE confidence=0.594

216
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:44.469
temptation. You see, I know from experience firsthand that sometimes when I do nothing and I call it

NOTE confidence=0.838

217
01:02:44.479 --> 01:02:53.080
rest. I am more troubled in my mind and in my spirit and less connected to God than when I am active.

NOTE confidence=0.996

218
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:59.550
But in the same way that I can be active, I'm just active with whatever it is that I'm engaged with,

NOTE confidence=0.998

219
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:06.540
involved in doing and still not connected with God. Anyone else experience that and you find

NOTE confidence=0.996

220
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:11.659
yourself being tempted in your activity just like in your inactivity.

NOTE confidence=0.997

221
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:19.179
Sometimes the people, you end up spending time with the places you end up going, the things you end

NOTE confidence=0.997

222
01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:24.389
up laughing at the things that you end up thinking things that you end up saying the things that you

NOTE confidence=0.482

223
01:03:24.399 --> 01:03:29.340
end up doing those things don't lead you to rest. They lead you to moron rests

NOTE confidence=0.996

224
01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:38.949
even when those things are not sinful in and of themselves.

NOTE confidence=0.674

225
01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:48.179
And that's why Paul says that all things can be permissible but not everything is going to edify.

NOTE confidence=0.908

226
01:03:48.189 --> 01:03:58.320
You, build you up and bring you closer in your relationship with the creator who has given you seven

NOTE confidence=0.996

227
01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:10.550
days of enjoying His creation. Can you take one day and do something different with it and learn to

NOTE confidence=0.996

228
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:19.709
rest? I need to understand that when God says rest, I have six days to work and I have one day that

NOTE confidence=0.996

229
01:04:19.719 --> 01:04:28.280
I have to experience rest. He's saying I want you to experience me and all the gifts of creation

NOTE confidence=0.996

230
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:37.600
that I have given you. And if I can experience God and all the gifts of creation, all of them,

NOTE confidence=0.915

231
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:43.939
whatever they may be, whether they be in the city or in the countryside, whether it be alone or with

NOTE confidence=0.996

232
01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:51.139
people, whether it be drinking or eating or just sleeping or just resting in a way that brings me

NOTE confidence=0.972

233
01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:59.250
not to a place of dishonoring God, but honoring Him, then I know that I am practicing the day of

NOTE confidence=0.908

234
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:05.659
rest, the way that he intended. There was a time when the scriptures say that Adam and Eve were able

NOTE confidence=0.998

235
01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:13.409
to walk in the coolness of the garden with their creator. They had relationship, community

NOTE confidence=0.996

236
01:05:13.419 --> 01:05:20.679
connection. They were able to see everything that it meant to truly be with God. We struggle with

NOTE confidence=0.869

237
01:05:20.689 --> 01:05:26.709
all of those things. There's so many things always vying for our attention. We have internal and

NOTE confidence=0.996

238
01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:34.709
external forces, always working catastrophe in our lives, making sure that we never take rest. I

NOTE confidence=0.996

239
01:05:34.719 --> 01:05:42.080
know this to be true. But what if we are bold enough to act, to seize the moment and to say, I don't

NOTE confidence=0.996

240
01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:50.689
care what happens on the seventh day, I will take my rest and honor God. I will trust him because I

NOTE confidence=0.553

241
01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:56.639
have done everything I can in six days, everything I could do to try to save my marriage. In six

NOTE confidence=0.997

242
01:05:56.649 --> 01:06:02.760
days, I did it everything I could do to improve my relationship with my boyfriend, girlfriend,

NOTE confidence=0.984

243
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:10.449
fiance, whoever that person is, I did it, everything that I could do for my employer in six days, I

NOTE confidence=0.996

244
01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:17.239
did it. Everything I could do for my Children in six days, I offered everything and it's still not

NOTE confidence=0.996

245
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:26.719
enough I need to take my time and rest with God, with the God who gives me rest and gives me his

NOTE confidence=0.996

246
01:06:26.729 --> 01:06:33.370
gift to enjoy. I'm gonna trust God that everything I could do in six days, I've done it. But there's

NOTE confidence=0.991

247
01:06:33.379 --> 01:06:39.629
one day that day will remain blessed and holy and I'm gonna honor God with it. Imagine if we said

NOTE confidence=0.996

248
01:06:39.639 --> 01:06:48.090
those things, if we moved in that direction, something tells me we would experience a level of

NOTE confidence=0.996

249
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:53.439
multiplication that we had never experienced before. A level of blessing, a level of holiness, a

NOTE confidence=0.995

250
01:06:53.449 --> 01:07:05.570
level of connection with God and His creation that is unmatched in Hebrews 410. It promises this all

NOTE confidence=0.996

251
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:13.449
who entered into God's rest and rested from their labors just as God did after creating the world

NOTE confidence=0.996

252
01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:24.979
are going to experience the Sabbath. Rest, the Sabbath rest is for all those who stop working. The

NOTE confidence=0.956

253
01:07:24.989 --> 01:07:33.310
Sabbath rest is for everyone who ceases from their labors. So you're not experiencing a Sabbath rest.

NOTE confidence=0.949

254
01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:39.280
If you're still working, if you're still trying to fix things, if you're still trying to make it

NOTE confidence=0.996

255
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:47.540
happen through your own motivation, your own ingenuity, your own resources or the resources of

NOTE confidence=0.918

256
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:54.939
others, you're trying to bring blessing. When God is saying, why are you trying to bring blessing

NOTE confidence=0.996

257
01:07:54.949 --> 01:07:56.939
into your life when I'm your blessing?

NOTE confidence=0.961

258
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:05.280
Why are you trying to fix this when you can't? I can fix it though? Why are you trying to make it

NOTE confidence=0.996

259
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:11.689
better and improve it every day of the week? When your six days of effort haven't done anything at

NOTE confidence=0.845

260
01:08:11.699 --> 01:08:21.390
all? Not to the extent that they can. Aren't you ready to show me that you really trust me to do

NOTE confidence=0.997

261
01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:29.669
this for you? How many of you are ready to stop and to cease and to finally relax and let God do

NOTE confidence=0.996

262
01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.129
what he needs to do on our day of rest because you see when I rest, here's what you need to

NOTE confidence=0.999

263
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.049
understand God does not rest.

NOTE confidence=0.996

264
01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:51.009
God shows us the pattern of rest, but he doesn't rest from you. But I rest knowing that God

NOTE confidence=0.997

265
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:58.490
continues to be there for you and for me, I rest that I can't fix everything. As a pastor, I can't

NOTE confidence=0.997

266
01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:04.680
fix everything. As a life coach, I can't fix everything with my athletes or my community of faith. I

NOTE confidence=0.997

267
01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:13.330
know that I can't repair this world on my own. But I believe that when I rest, what I can do, God

NOTE confidence=0.999

268
01:09:13.339 --> 01:09:13.729
can

NOTE confidence=0.895

269
01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:23.168
and what I tried to do in six days, he could do it on the day that I just choose to rest and I could

NOTE confidence=0.714

270
01:09:23.179 --> 01:09:30.128
put my faith in Him. Anybody else want to do that today? Anybody else excited to try that. Anybody

NOTE confidence=0.483

271
01:09:30.139 --> 01:09:36.410
else wanna put God to the test. I want to show you something else. And it's in Psalm 46.

NOTE confidence=0.984

272
01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:49.850
And this passage says that he is able to be exalted among the nations and he is exalted in the earth

NOTE confidence=0.912

273
01:09:49.859 --> 01:10:02.370
when he has people, you and me who do this obey him in this be still and know that He is God.

NOTE confidence=0.542

274
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:16.299
The thing about this word be still in the sep in ancient Greek. In this version states this word

NOTE confidence=0.88

275
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:25.600
right here. Can we put it up? And the word is Jesus Chao. And the thing about this word is that

NOTE confidence=0.996

276
01:10:25.609 --> 01:10:34.729
sometimes it gets just interpreted wrongly because the thing about being still sometimes still

NOTE confidence=0.968

277
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:48.100
conveys that there is some kind of activity that is required from us. And that activity can

NOTE confidence=0.996

278
01:10:48.109 --> 01:10:53.520
sometimes be interpreted as I'm gonna do everything that I can. And then I'm gonna let God do

NOTE confidence=0.996

279
01:10:53.529 --> 01:10:59.390
everything that He can, which I think we've seen God says you have six days for that. But on the

NOTE confidence=0.775

280
01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:08.200
seventh day, I want you to rest. When the psalmist writes this, there are external and internal cata

NOTE confidence=0.997

281
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:18.549
catastrophes happening in the world. And this word can actually be translated. Relax. That's why we

NOTE confidence=0.977

282
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:29.729
call the series. Relax because the word be still means relax. It actually means just rest. It means

NOTE confidence=0.996

283
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:39.720
have leisure, it means let go, it means surrender. And so whenever this word keeps coming up, it's

NOTE confidence=0.967

284
01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:48.700
conveying all of these things. And interestingly enough, the Hebrew term for it is Rafa and the word

NOTE confidence=1.0

285
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:58.529
Raphah, be still, is rendered as "let go." "Relax." "Stop."

NOTE confidence=0.996

286
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:05.830
I don't know about you, but stopping has never been my strong suit.

NOTE confidence=0.997

287
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:18.479
Even as a child, as I tortured my parents and my siblings, I would hear the word stop a lot and I

NOTE confidence=0.996

288
01:12:18.779 --> 01:12:27.390
refused to obey it. Even in Montreal, a stop sign just means just roll, slower,

NOTE confidence=0.995

289
01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:42.160
advance cautiously, but don't stop because the person behind you is thinking the same thing and

NOTE confidence=0.624

290
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:43.740
they're just going to hit you if you stop.

NOTE confidence=0.775

291
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:52.879
And so you just keep rolling, not at the same speed, just kind of rolling.

NOTE confidence=0.869

292
01:12:55.899 --> 01:13:04.589
And so we never stopped. Doesn't it feel like we never stop. And yet the commandment here is, are

NOTE confidence=0.997

293
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:12.879
you able to enter into a complete act of surrender, a release of striving and hostility? Are you

NOTE confidence=0.997

294
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:20.459
ready now to finally let go? It doesn't matter what is happening. Do you have an open mind for this?

NOTE confidence=0.996

295
01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:27.520
An open attitude for this? Are you ready to contemplate this? But more important? Are you actually

NOTE confidence=0.996

296
01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:34.189
ready to act on it by ceasing to act and just finally stop?

NOTE confidence=0.948

297
01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:44.620
I look at what it looks like in the scriptures to rest. And I see this steeping

NOTE confidence=0.758

298
01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:58.750
in creation sting in the creator. And it's interesting because I don't like tea,

NOTE confidence=0.977

299
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:10.569
I'll drink it, but I prefer coffee. In fact, this morning before even coming to church, I've already

NOTE confidence=0.757

300
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:21.000
had four. That's how much I love them and espressos, of course. Uh What else would I have? But and

NOTE confidence=0.996

301
01:14:21.009 --> 01:14:26.569
black, no sugar, no milk, just espressos. You want me to relax.

NOTE confidence=0.541

302
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.870
I'm having a very hard time right now.

NOTE confidence=0.903

303
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:44.549
I should probably relax from having so many espressos, but I just love them. And there's this thing

NOTE confidence=0.694

304
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.390
about me and my espresso and just sitting there and as short as they are. Hm, they're just so good.

NOTE confidence=0.597

305
01:14:52.740 --> 01:15:03.689
I just ST in my espresso. I want to ask you, can you deep in the presence of God? You know, you tea

NOTE confidence=0.429

306
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:14.140
drinkers, you like to steep your TB, you like to make sure that you get every ounce out of that

NOTE confidence=0.997

307
01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:21.149
combination. Of herbs and spices and you really taste what's going on there.

NOTE confidence=0.877

308
01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:33.229
I know that you steep it because you want to get every ounce of flavor out of that. I don't know

NOTE confidence=0.765

309
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:40.040
about you, but I am ready to experience every ounce of flavor that God has for all of us in his

NOTE confidence=0.91

310
01:15:40.049 --> 01:15:50.120
creation. And the way that he says that we get to experience that is by sting in his rest, sting in

NOTE confidence=0.987

311
01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:59.490
his presence, ceasing relaxing from all the things that we have worked at for six days. But it's now

NOTE confidence=0.423

312
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:05.689
time to trust him. I'll be ready to do that. I'll be ready to turn our attention to him in that way.

NOTE confidence=0.996

313
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:15.169
When we know God, we truly get to know ourselves. And I think sometimes we stay busy because we're

NOTE confidence=0.996

314
01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.970
scared about what we're about to find out.

NOTE confidence=0.558

315
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.549
We're worried about what he's going to show us. We're concerned about what he's going to be shouting

NOTE confidence=0.997

316
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.709
at us to stop. Imagine if I stop and start taking a day of rest. And then God says, you know that

NOTE confidence=0.552

317
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.959
relationship you're in, I don't want you to be in it. You're like I knew I shouldn't have stopped.

NOTE confidence=0.931

318
01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:44.700
Why did I rest? You know, that thing that you've been doing? I'm telling you that if you keep going

NOTE confidence=0.542

319
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:50.790
this way, it is going to lead to even greater destruction. You're like, but it gives me so much

NOTE confidence=0.406

320
01:16:50.799 --> 01:16:58.629
pleasure. Now, what it gives you is a dopamine hit and what it does is that it takes away more than

NOTE confidence=0.996

321
01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.419
it can ever give.

NOTE confidence=0.954

322
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:08.120
And instead of you experiencing rest, what you're experiencing is more unrest. You see when you stop

NOTE confidence=0.998

323
01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:10.689
and you relax and you let go and you surrender,

NOTE confidence=0.996

324
01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:22.109
you actually get to know God. And here's what happens is that as you know, God, God shows you not

NOTE confidence=0.996

325
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:33.540
just who he is but who you are. And then he says now that you know what I know, how about we walk to

NOTE confidence=0.999

326
01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.240
this new place together

NOTE confidence=0.764

327
01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:42.700
when my kids were little, they never used to want to leave the place they were in. And I discovered

NOTE confidence=0.996

328
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:49.029
that as a father, the only way I could get them to move from that place to another place was to say

NOTE confidence=0.996

329
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.270
these key words. Let's go to a new place.

NOTE confidence=0.809

330
01:17:56.339 --> 01:18:04.290
And my kids understood that a new place meant the unknown adventure, new possibilities and new

NOTE confidence=0.996

331
01:18:04.299 --> 01:18:11.649
experience. And as much as this was amazing, the idea that something could be more amazing

NOTE confidence=0.996

332
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:18.729
was enough to make them leave that place. Let me ask you something, you know why?

NOTE confidence=0.768

333
01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:26.040
OK, I was gonna say, let me ask you something but um we're out of time. So I'm just gonna tell you

NOTE confidence=0.999

334
01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:27.029
something. Is that OK?

NOTE confidence=0.905

335
01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:35.810
I'm just gonna get right to it. I'm gonna tell you something. The reason you don't leave the place

NOTE confidence=0.969

336
01:18:35.819 --> 01:18:39.370
you're in is because you don't think there's a better place to go to.

NOTE confidence=0.643

337
01:18:42.049 --> 01:18:48.580
But when God is the one showing you and telling you and promising to walk with you, guess what?

NOTE confidence=0.982

338
01:18:48.819 --> 01:18:54.080
You're ready to go there. But then you say, but God, the thing I have right now is the best thing

NOTE confidence=0.967

339
01:18:54.089 --> 01:19:02.930
I've had in a really long time. But what if God still says if you let this go? I've got for you a

NOTE confidence=0.999

340
01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:04.040
new place.

NOTE confidence=0.655

341
01:19:06.459 --> 01:19:15.600
Wouldn't you want to go? If God is the one leading you there, not you God, right? Because if it's me,

NOTE confidence=0.987

342
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:17.600
you know, I'm not a great guide.

NOTE confidence=0.763

343
01:19:21.939 --> 01:19:23.500
The best soul guide I know

NOTE confidence=0.998

344
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.080
is and always will be

NOTE confidence=0.998

345
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.120
the Holy Spirit.

NOTE confidence=0.993

346
01:19:33.439 --> 01:19:42.140
The Holy Spirit wants to lead us to that new place. Let's go together and let's experience our rest.

NOTE confidence=0.999

347
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:43.700
God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

NOTE confidence=0.715

348
01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:57.080
Would you stand as we just close in a word of prayer? And I want to pray with you and the service

NOTE confidence=0.86

349
01:19:57.089 --> 01:20:02.810
isn't over, but it's just me wanting to take this moment for us to pray together. The band's coming

NOTE confidence=0.57

350
01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:09.149
back up and they're going to sing a song uh with us that is gonna help us to just make this that

NOTE confidence=0.771

351
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:15.580
much more meaningful for each of us. And then, you know, wait for our M CS to dismiss us. And I just

NOTE confidence=0.699

352
01:20:15.589 --> 01:20:19.540
want to thank you for being a part of this gathering, to being a part of this community for

NOTE confidence=0.93

353
01:20:19.549 --> 01:20:26.740
journeying together for taking time out of your busy life and schedule. Um to make this your, your

NOTE confidence=0.763

354
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:33.290
day of rest and your moment of rest. And I just want to preface this by saying, um,

NOTE confidence=0.981

355
01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:43.330
rest isn't, you know, coming to church for all of us. I cannot rest on a Sunday. Makes sense, right?

NOTE confidence=0.684

356
01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:50.109
I can't rest on a Saturday because I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm working, getting ready for today. In fact,

NOTE confidence=0.998

357
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:58.029
if I don't take a day of rest, I can't function at the level that I need to, to do the things that I

NOTE confidence=0.987

358
01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:04.149
need to do in the same way that Sunday may not be a day of rest for you because you had to get up

NOTE confidence=0.996

359
01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.979
early, you had to come to church,

NOTE confidence=0.998

360
01:21:10.089 --> 01:21:20.899
but it was something that still falls into what is important, but not necessarily giving you that

NOTE confidence=0.996

361
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:27.770
connection and that rest that you need. Sometimes we come to church and something disrupts our

NOTE confidence=0.634

362
01:21:27.779 --> 01:21:33.799
connection and that can happen because community is messy.

NOTE confidence=0.992

363
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:41.470
But I know that God can still teach us and show us

NOTE confidence=0.996

364
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:53.330
how when and where to experience rest. Are you ready to go on that journey together? And so father,

NOTE confidence=0.869

365
01:21:53.339 --> 01:22:02.220
I want to thank you for every person that by you has already been called blessed and holy, created

NOTE confidence=0.996

366
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:14.669
for amazing purposes to accomplish and to do great things. But to also experience a great God. And I

NOTE confidence=0.504

367
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:23.950
pray Lord that we would not settle for accomplish this MS when we can experience relationships and

NOTE confidence=0.996

368
01:22:23.959 --> 01:22:35.779
experience a relationship with you I pray that we would work for those six days and we would find

NOTE confidence=0.996

369
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:45.919
rest on the seventh and that we would find time to connect with you and all the gifts that you have

NOTE confidence=0.996

370
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:56.850
given to us through your creation. I pray that you draw us closer to you and that you would help us

NOTE confidence=0.992

371
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.200
to get to that new place together. And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Would you receive

NOTE confidence=0.836

372
01:23:06.209 --> 01:23:12.229
that blessing and that prayer? And let's sing this song together. Would you welcome the River's Edge

NOTE confidence=0.997

373
01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.810
worship team? Thank you so much.

NOTE confidence=0.991

374
01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.229
Thank you Lord Jesus.

NOTE confidence=0.925

375
01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:16.600
Thank you. Worship team. Well, that brings us to the close of this morning's service as a chronic

NOTE confidence=0.992

376
01:30:16.609 --> 01:30:21.640
busy body. I think there was a word for me in here today. We hope there was one for you as well

NOTE confidence=0.999

377
01:30:22.029 --> 01:30:31.129
before you leave, please do not leave without receiving prayer. We have a prayer team who is ready

NOTE confidence=0.996

378
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:39.009
to pray with you to join with you. Um If there's something on your heart, don't leave with it, still

NOTE confidence=0.997

379
01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:47.660
there, meet with us on my right and they will join with you in corporate prayer and keep in mind

NOTE confidence=0.996

380
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:53.060
that we have next steps. Uh Roots is pretty much everyone's next step. I've actually done it with

NOTE confidence=0.996

381
01:30:53.069 --> 01:30:58.390
the worship team. Uh On Thursday nights, it actually opens up your eyes to a lot of little things

NOTE confidence=0.995

382
01:30:58.399 --> 01:31:02.879
that if you've walked with Christ for a long time, you actually tend to miss some of these key

NOTE confidence=0.995

383
01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:08.470
important things. But uh you got roots that would lead into baptism to alpha boundaries, they're all

NOTE confidence=0.676

384
01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:16.500
very important. Um So it's a, it's a great place to start. Um Also after party, uh there's cold

NOTE confidence=0.978

385
01:31:16.509 --> 01:31:21.580
refreshments. I know it's a little bit hot in here, especially with more people. Um So everyone make

NOTE confidence=0.803

386
01:31:21.589 --> 01:31:28.379
sure you stop by the uh the afterparty and talk to somebody you haven't talked to. Um honest, it's a

NOTE confidence=0.997

387
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:34.859
great place to get connected. And with that, have a great week. Everyone take care, have a great

NOTE confidence=0.997

388
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:35.339
week.
