00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:25.269
Lord, you invited all who are weary to come to you for rest. Today, I come to you for that rest.

NOTE confidence=0.997

2
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:37.989
I bring you the heavy burden of work, the tasks that are incomplete, the plans I want to keep

NOTE confidence=0.996

3
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.390
thinking through and the deadlines that are quickly approaching.

NOTE confidence=0.996

4
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:56.450
I'm tempted to believe that my worth is in my accomplishments. Remind me that I am a valued child of

NOTE confidence=0.999

5
00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:59.649
God based on the work of Christ.

NOTE confidence=0.996

6
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:12.049
And I'm tempted to believe that my security is in my possessions. Remind me of the greater and truer

NOTE confidence=0.998

7
00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:15.350
inheritance that is kept in heaven for me.

NOTE confidence=0.965

8
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:27.369
And on this day of rest help me to slow down, calm my restless heart and anxious thoughts.

NOTE confidence=0.996

9
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:39.528
And on this day of rest help me to enjoy your creation, not as a tool for my productivity, but as a

NOTE confidence=0.705

10
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:50.250
gift to delight in. And on this day of rest above all else help me to be aware of your presence with

NOTE confidence=0.999

11
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.530
me.

NOTE confidence=0.998

12
00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:57.599
You are the one who created this world and placed me in it

NOTE confidence=0.998

13
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:12.429
and you are the one who said it is finished. The work is complete and you are the one who now

NOTE confidence=0.99

14
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.349
invites me into the rest that Christ earned for me.

NOTE confidence=0.998

15
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.330
So help me to enter that rest today.

life in their heart, in their mind and their spirit and their soul. Lord, we love you, we lift you

NOTE confidence=0.641

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.650

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.540
right?

NOTE confidence=0.795

72
00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:18.030
Amen. I, I'm dressed for it

NOTE confidence=0.654

73
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:30.739
and we know that winter is coming. So as Canadians, we love summertime. So it's a blessing. God is

NOTE confidence=0.563

74
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:38.130
blessing us, right? Amen. Amen. Uh We have a wonderful gathering plan for you. Um We're today, we're

NOTE confidence=0.996

75
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:45.489
continuing the series called Relax and the message is rest through connection. Um We also want to

NOTE confidence=0.511

76
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:52.689
talk to you about um how we can reveal faith uh and bring God's blessing in our lives. Uh And that's

NOTE confidence=0.942

77
00:19:52.699 --> 00:20:00.479
through generosity. Yes. And so we're gonna take a time to read from God's Word. Um And the passage

NOTE confidence=0.732

78
00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:11.619
that I've chosen for today is from Matthew 14 um verses 15 to 21. And it says, as e as evening

NOTE confidence=0.943

79
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:18.300
approached, the disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place and it's already getting late,

NOTE confidence=0.997

80
00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:24.890
send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food. And Jesus replied,

NOTE confidence=0.996

81
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:32.640
they do not need to go away. You give them something to eat. We only have five loaves of bread and

NOTE confidence=0.999

82
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:38.880
two fish. They answered, bring them here to me. He said, and he directed the people to sit down on

NOTE confidence=0.996

83
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:44.920
the grass, taking the five loaves and two fish and looking up to heaven. He gave thanks and broke

NOTE confidence=0.995

84
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:50.449
the loaves and then he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people and they

NOTE confidence=0.87

85
00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:57.329
all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up 12 basket fulls of broken pieces that were

NOTE confidence=0.996

86
00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:05.640
left over. The number of those who ate was about 5000 men besides women and Children. Yeah.

NOTE confidence=0.995

87
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:11.489
Incredible. Right. So the last time I spoke on this topic, we pulled out a few points. We pulled out

NOTE confidence=0.997

88
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:18.469
that Jesus gave thanks first before he multiplied, he called the disciples to go out and to feed the

NOTE confidence=0.904

89
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:25.010
people and that's us and that he provided in excess. Those were the points. But I wanna actually

NOTE confidence=0.983

90
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:32.229
highlight another point from this passage today that it was from the disciples generosity with what

NOTE confidence=0.997

91
00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:40.869
little they felt they had that created a space for an entire group of people. Over 5000 people to

NOTE confidence=0.996

92
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:52.869
stay and hear God speak. They created a community through their generosity with, with the purpose of

NOTE confidence=0.996

93
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.010
allowing people literally to sit at the feet of Jesus and to hear His word. And that is what we are

NOTE confidence=0.996

94
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:06.089
called to do. It was the disciples that had to move in that generosity. They were already a part of

NOTE confidence=0.538

95
00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:13.530
Jesus's crew. So we're speaking to the community of Rivers Edge today. If you consider yourself part

NOTE confidence=0.989

96
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:22.170
of the community, there's a call on us to be generous with what we feel we might be lacking even.

NOTE confidence=0.474

97
00:22:22.489 --> 00:22:29.569
And I want to point out that God did this with the leftovers from their day, the left over of their

NOTE confidence=0.934

98
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:37.359
lunch, not even their first fruits which we are called to give. So imagine what we are capable of

NOTE confidence=0.989

99
00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:45.270
outside of our own community with the generosity that God calls us to have. We're meant to call on

NOTE confidence=0.99

100
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.020
the community outside of these doors. We're meant to touch people and to glue them into this

NOTE confidence=0.524

101
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:58.689
community at the foot of Jesus. And so we have multiple ways to give. There is e transfers. There

NOTE confidence=0.996

102
00:22:58.699 --> 00:23:06.099
are the kiosks at the back. Um You can scan the QR code, there is a mandate on this community and

NOTE confidence=0.996

103
00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:12.739
God wants to do exceedingly more than we can imagine with our generosity. And so with that, we're

NOTE confidence=0.742

104
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:19.760
gonna pray over it. Let let's take the opportunity to pray together. It's our prayer that uh that

NOTE confidence=0.924

105
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:25.359
brings uh that God brings breakthroughs through and meaningful moments for the rest of our lives in

NOTE confidence=0.971

106
00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:34.760
this season. Um So let's pray, Father God, we're all here for a purpose. You didn't lead us here by

NOTE confidence=0.996

107
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:40.800
accidents, whether we're watching online or here in person. We've come with a lot of burdens. We've

NOTE confidence=0.83

108
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.989
come with a lot of, you know, heavy things that we're, we're going through in our lives. But you've

NOTE confidence=0.864

109
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.060
brought us here because you wanna fill us with rest. You wanna fill us with your peace and your love.

NOTE confidence=0.995

110
00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:57.979
I pray over the community here and online, whatever they're going through whatever life is throwing

NOTE confidence=0.907

111
00:23:57.989 --> 00:24:03.500
at them. Um You're always gonna be there. You have always been there. You are our source of strength

NOTE confidence=0.979

112
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:11.180
and our source of peace. Um I pray over everyone and I pray over the gathering and um may your name

NOTE confidence=0.93

113
00:24:11.189 --> 00:24:17.959
be lifted high and that uh we may bring everything that we have, which is just a, a pray a

NOTE confidence=0.845

114
00:24:17.969 --> 00:24:23.599
hallelujah to you in jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

NOTE confidence=0.611

115
00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:36.099
Our God is so great. The splendor of the king clothed the majesty. Let all the earth rejoice how

120
00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:25.810
and trample eye

NOTE confidence=0.516

121
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.109
trembles at

NOTE confidence=0.645

122
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:32.489
out

NOTE confidence=0.456

123
00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:56.250
the h to

NOTE confidence=0.725

124
00:26:04.189 --> 00:26:04.550
time

NOTE confidence=0.595

125
00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:41.689
with me.

NOTE confidence=0.529

126
00:27:09.939 --> 00:27:10.180
Now

NOTE confidence=0.704

127
00:27:47.489 --> 00:27:47.800
leaves

NOTE confidence=0.614

128
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.790
when

NOTE confidence=0.756

129
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.800
let's sing it all together just for the voices.

NOTE confidence=0.983

130
00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:26.410
His

NOTE confidence=0.756

131
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.989
sing with me. He

NOTE confidence=0.959

132
00:30:33.869 --> 00:30:34.569
his eye

NOTE confidence=0.711

133
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.510
and always

NOTE confidence=0.91

134
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.199
how great

NOTE confidence=0.519

135
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.619
tears are

NOTE confidence=0.494

136
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:53.969
our.

NOTE confidence=0.377

137
00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:14.719
Wow.

NOTE confidence=0.933

138
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:18.569
Yes.

NOTE confidence=0.003

139
00:31:27.449 --> 00:31:27.459
Oh,

NOTE confidence=0.528

140
00:31:35.739 --> 00:31:36.939
here's a

NOTE confidence=0.544

141
00:31:46.189 --> 00:31:46.319
race.

NOTE confidence=0.986

142
00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:35.739
You are my

NOTE confidence=0.64

143
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.819
everything. Yeah.

NOTE confidence=0.997

144
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.949
Jesus.

NOTE confidence=0.248

145
00:32:54.199 --> 00:32:57.500
Come you in here. Fix our eyes on you. Stay in this atmosphere.

NOTE confidence=0.411

146
00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:09.599
Let's see.

NOTE confidence=0.996

147
00:33:13.469 --> 00:33:13.810
You

NOTE confidence=0.767

148
00:33:17.449 --> 00:33:20.290
have everything you

NOTE confidence=0.796

149
00:33:26.469 --> 00:33:30.020
now forever.

NOTE confidence=0.998

150
00:33:33.209 --> 00:33:33.709
You

NOTE confidence=0.984

151
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.640
bring you.

NOTE confidence=0.595

152
00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:48.770
Oh you

NOTE confidence=0.42

153
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.020
if you want Jesus.

NOTE confidence=0.482

154
00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:58.349
Thank you.

NOTE confidence=0.413

155
00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:23.750
And the

NOTE confidence=0.682

156
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.510
why

NOTE confidence=0.525

157
00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:02.459
J in

NOTE confidence=0.598

158
00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:23.290
you are my home. Pretty man.

NOTE confidence=0.926

159
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.810
I hope.

NOTE confidence=0.546

160
00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:48.199
Yeah.

NOTE confidence=0.527

161
00:37:08.689 --> 00:37:19.550
Now that found men, even the sun will bring you praise. It will follow you

NOTE confidence=0.523

162
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:29.889
when I am lost you on my Jesus man stings you,

NOTE confidence=0.746

163
00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:33.719
you

NOTE confidence=0.546

164
00:37:45.669 --> 00:37:45.820
mhm

NOTE confidence=0.736

165
00:38:20.179 --> 00:38:20.479
So

NOTE confidence=0.896

166
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.760
beyond

NOTE confidence=0.562

167
00:38:54.169 --> 00:38:54.840
was declared

NOTE confidence=0.49

168
00:39:13.909 --> 00:39:14.000
yes

NOTE confidence=0.968

169
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:33.320
in the

NOTE confidence=0.604

170
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.370
I love

NOTE confidence=0.003

171
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.959
and that but

NOTE confidence=0.306

172
00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:55.580
we are.

NOTE confidence=0.59

173
00:40:07.899 --> 00:40:08.520
Thank you.

NOTE confidence=0.477

174
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.800
Be Yeah, it

NOTE confidence=0.729

175
00:41:57.729 --> 00:41:57.860
quality

NOTE confidence=0.993

176
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.770
are you

NOTE confidence=0.466

177
00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:18.879
where he is?

NOTE confidence=0.448

178
00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:29.320
Are you

NOTE confidence=0.973

179
00:43:45.949 --> 00:43:55.870
everybody so good to be with you? You guys are you happy? You're here too. Is it just me? Yeah. You

NOTE confidence=0.995

180
00:43:55.879 --> 00:44:01.879
know one of the things about uh understanding rest is about understanding how it can work best for

NOTE confidence=0.831

181
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:10.419
us. And yet God gives us some pretty clear principles on how it can work, right? But not all of us

NOTE confidence=0.957

182
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:19.419
take rests in the same way, not all of us enjoy rest the same way. Some of us have preferences and

NOTE confidence=0.996

183
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:30.399
we prefer people with whom we can find rest with. But what if rest isn't found in activity? Nor is

NOTE confidence=0.996

184
00:44:30.409 --> 00:44:39.199
it found in inactivity? Have you found that when we are lazy, we can sometimes actually find

NOTE confidence=0.991

185
00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:49.000
ourselves still lacking rest. Have you found that when you actually go to take a rest, you come back

NOTE confidence=0.996

186
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:58.620
and you found and discover that you're still not rested. And that's because rest isn't found in the

NOTE confidence=0.996

187
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:09.939
things that we are driven to experience. But it's rather driven towards an experience with the one

NOTE confidence=0.831

188
00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:18.729
who created and established rest in the first place. And when we understand that it redefines our

NOTE confidence=0.997

189
00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:30.239
understanding, but also in how we experience rest. God gives us an opportunity to have time every

NOTE confidence=0.996

190
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:37.149
day. We have time every day, we have minutes that turn into days, that turn into weeks and look at

NOTE confidence=0.954

191
00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:44.639
us already halfway through the year. And sometimes when we look at where we're at, we can sometimes

NOTE confidence=0.996

192
00:45:44.649 --> 00:45:53.379
feel accomplished, we've done what we set out to do. And other times we look back and we say I'm

NOTE confidence=0.996

193
00:45:53.389 --> 00:46:02.770
actually still so far behind in achieving and accomplishing the things that I set out for myself. At

NOTE confidence=0.999

194
00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:11.429
the beginning of the year, we sometimes find ourselves in this constant struggle of either being

NOTE confidence=0.997

195
00:46:11.439 --> 00:46:24.389
affirmed or in many ways diminished, diminished by ourselves, diminished by others, sometimes given

NOTE confidence=0.99

196
00:46:24.399 --> 00:46:33.649
a task. But we can't seem to muster the energy to actually accomplish it, fulfill it. And even bring

NOTE confidence=0.996

197
00:46:34.169 --> 00:46:46.159
it to the deadline that was given to us a deadline that was external. One that was internal. Either

NOTE confidence=0.997

198
00:46:46.169 --> 00:46:56.590
way we find ourselves struggling to experience rest. We sometimes talk to people and they say I find

NOTE confidence=0.997

199
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:09.159
rest in nature. I find rest in movies. I find rest in reading books. I find rest with having deep

NOTE confidence=0.997

200
00:47:09.169 --> 00:47:17.739
and meaningful conversations. I find rest when I'm with family. I find rest when I'm far, far away

NOTE confidence=0.634

201
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:26.729
from family, I find rest when I'm on vacation. Um, I find rest when I'm away from work. I find rest.

NOTE confidence=0.997

202
00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:38.110
Actually when I'm working, going to the office or going away from home gives me rest. And the more I

NOTE confidence=0.997

203
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:46.010
talk to people and the more I realize everyone has a very different rhythm, understanding and

NOTE confidence=0.996

204
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:53.750
experience of how to achieve rest. I rest most when I'm in the gym, I rest most when I'm eating, I

NOTE confidence=0.997

205
00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:05.860
rest most when I'm sleeping, when I'm napping. When I'm just finding nothing at all to do whatever

NOTE confidence=0.996

206
00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:16.929
we do. Many of us have come to understand this truth. No matter how much rust we take, we still are

NOTE confidence=0.98

207
00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:24.850
far from experience again. Is it possible that what we lack is not time, not interests, not hobbies,

NOTE confidence=0.65

208
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:36.659
not friends, not family. Is it possible that what we lack is actually a true understanding of rest

NOTE confidence=0.9864999999999999

209
00:48:37.629 --> 00:48:46.669
that what we perceive to be rest actually causes more unrest. II, I see people who work four hours

NOTE confidence=0.996

210
00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:56.800
consecutively and then find themselves exhausted. Just like I see someone who can play video games

NOTE confidence=0.997

211
00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:06.959
for four hours continuously and also not find rest. You see both are seeking rest, both are seeking

NOTE confidence=0.892

212
00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:16.479
what the scriptures called. Shalom, what the scriptures call. Rest both are trying to find it in

NOTE confidence=0.971

213
00:49:16.489 --> 00:49:26.919
their activity and in their inactivity, but neither are rest. Both are actually unrest because God

NOTE confidence=0.996

214
00:49:26.929 --> 00:49:33.179
established a rhythm for us to follow. And the interesting thing about our work and our rest is that

NOTE confidence=0.997

215
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:39.780
when God created in the book of Genesis, when we see the sequence of days, he says there was evening

NOTE confidence=0.996

216
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:50.729
and then there was morning and he says this was the first day. This was the first day. What God does

NOTE confidence=0.952

217
00:49:50.739 --> 00:49:59.280
is that God rests in preparation for the next day. I don't know about you, but I often do not do

NOTE confidence=0.8445

218
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:11.810
that. II I have this rhythm of rest that sometimes I, I try to find rest by actually finding myself

NOTE confidence=0.981

219
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:20.260
staying up doing other things, being tired in a different way. And instead of finding and

NOTE confidence=0.996

220
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:30.560
experiencing rest, I find myself still far from it. Why? Because my ceasing from activity has just

NOTE confidence=0.996

221
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:38.320
continued into the evening, anyone else and then we're up, we're not sleeping, we're not resting and

NOTE confidence=0.932

222
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:44.669
we're drained and we're incapable of facing the next day. And so Jesus says, I want you to

NOTE confidence=0.995

223
00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:52.790
understand that when I become your rest, I'm gonna show you and help you to experience a new way to

NOTE confidence=0.996

224
00:50:52.800 --> 00:51:00.860
have this. But before we can get to Jesus, we have to understand how God established this pattern in

NOTE confidence=0.977

225
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:11.590
the first place. And so we see in creation that on humanity's very first full day they rested. God

NOTE confidence=0.564

226
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:19.469
tells them I want you to rest. Why? Because it's important for God. So therefore, it must be

NOTE confidence=0.996

227
00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:28.189
important for us. God sets the example by resting so that we understand that on our first day alive,

NOTE confidence=0.993

228
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:36.899
it's supposed to be a day of rest. We're supposed to enter into a new understanding of rest. God

NOTE confidence=0.996

229
00:51:36.909 --> 00:51:44.750
says, I want you to prioritize it. It's interesting because I don't prioritize rest. I uh prioritize

NOTE confidence=0.859

230
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:53.860
accomplishments. I prioritize getting things done. I, I prioritize doing things that bring

NOTE confidence=0.951

231
00:51:53.870 --> 00:52:01.139
fulfillment to me without realizing that what they're in essence doing is still draining me. But

NOTE confidence=0.996

232
00:52:01.149 --> 00:52:08.600
when God asks me to prioritize rest, he's actually asking me to do something different. So when we

NOTE confidence=0.972

233
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:18.149
talk about having connection with things that give us rest, maybe God doesn't even come onto the

NOTE confidence=0.974

234
00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:26.419
list that we have in our mind of how we experience rest. Maybe spending time with God isn't how we

NOTE confidence=0.996

235
00:52:26.429 --> 00:52:36.379
would envision or imagine what it looks like to have rest. And so in Exodus chapter 20 take a look

NOTE confidence=0.996

236
00:52:36.389 --> 00:52:46.379
at verse eight to verse 11, we receive this commandment and it says, observe the Sabbath day by

NOTE confidence=0.997

237
00:52:46.389 --> 00:52:54.909
keeping it holy. And what God wants us to understand is that the day of rest is a blessed day and it

NOTE confidence=0.997

238
00:52:54.919 --> 00:53:03.750
is a holy day. It is a blessed day and it is a holy day because from the very nature of God, he

NOTE confidence=0.998

239
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:12.040
introduces us to rest and therefore commands us to experience that rest. And when we experience rest

NOTE confidence=0.994

240
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:20.080
his way, well, then that day becomes a date in which is blessed and holy for us. It isn't in the

NOTE confidence=0.997

241
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:31.080
observance of the Sabbath, the way that we would just simply observe any other act or activity and

NOTE confidence=0.997

242
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:42.260
make it an act or an activity that requires us to do something. But it is rather one that helps us

NOTE confidence=0.998

243
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:52.780
to have the correct understanding, the correct openness of mind, the correct way of viewing rest

NOTE confidence=0.998

244
00:53:53.229 --> 00:54:02.280
through practice that enables us to have a connection that we otherwise would not have with God and

NOTE confidence=0.996

245
00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:11.439
His creation. So God wants us to understand that in this passage, we are to keep it holy. In other

NOTE confidence=0.997

246
00:54:11.449 --> 00:54:18.689
words, you are to prioritize it. It means in the light of everything else that is busy and about

NOTE confidence=0.883

247
00:54:18.699 --> 00:54:26.219
activity. God is saying I still want you to take that rest because if you go out and labor on a day

NOTE confidence=0.979

248
00:54:26.229 --> 00:54:30.149
in which you're supposed to be resting, I want you to know you're not gonna achieve more, you're

NOTE confidence=0.945

249
00:54:30.159 --> 00:54:36.270
actually gonna achieve less. You're not gonna accomplish more, you will accomplish less, you're not

NOTE confidence=0.996

250
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.560
gonna harvest more, you're not gonna harvest anything at all. I promise you if you go out on the

NOTE confidence=0.996

251
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:47.780
seventh day, if you do not take the rest, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna have less. Not

NOTE confidence=0.999

252
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.139
more.

NOTE confidence=0.996

253
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:57.580
Now, if we understand this, then we begin to understand that my activity isn't what prospers me. It

NOTE confidence=0.996

254
00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:04.760
is my observance of what he declares to be blessed and holy. If I observe what God says is blessed

NOTE confidence=0.864

255
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:15.070
and holy, then what happens is that I experience blessing and I experienced his holiness. I have a

NOTE confidence=0.996

256
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:26.780
connection that now is not going to be severed because I have created a rhythm of work and rest that

NOTE confidence=0.997

257
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:34.250
God is able to honor. In verse nine. He says, you have six days each week for your ordinary work.

NOTE confidence=0.991

258
00:55:35.949 --> 00:55:44.360
Six days. He's saying I want you to do this six days. I don't want you to add 1/7. I want you to

NOTE confidence=0.997

259
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:52.270
begin to discipline yourself to understand that I didn't do this so that you could just work seven

NOTE confidence=0.992

260
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:59.949
days. I did this so that you would understand that you have to insert that day of rest. It isn't

NOTE confidence=0.989

261
00:55:59.959 --> 00:56:05.459
something that is optional. It's something that I command. It is not something that you can just

NOTE confidence=0.996

262
00:56:05.469 --> 00:56:08.860
choose to avoid, you must obey.

NOTE confidence=0.996

263
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:17.320
And it's hard for us to do that in our society. I think we're just so accustomed to always being

NOTE confidence=0.997

264
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:24.489
active that we don't even know what this looks like. You see, even when I'm lazy, even when I'm

NOTE confidence=0.997

265
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:31.439
inactive, I could be filling up a day and not resting the way that God wants me to do. You guys get

NOTE confidence=0.996

266
00:56:31.449 --> 00:56:40.540
that? See, it isn't because I stopped working. It's because I actually am not resting the way that

NOTE confidence=0.831

267
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:49.169
he tells me to. Now, we're still in this hybrid thing with work and, um, maybe we'll never go back

NOTE confidence=0.945

268
00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:54.429
to a full office thing. And a lot of people say, you know, when I'm at the office, I just take

NOTE confidence=0.987

269
00:56:54.439 --> 00:57:01.610
longer lunches anyways and I talk even more at the water cooler and take more breaks in people's

NOTE confidence=0.943

270
00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:09.449
cubicles. And I don't actually get more done at work probably about the same. So if I'm supposed to

NOTE confidence=0.994

271
00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:15.189
be there for eight hours, I only actually work five, whether I'm at home or whether I'm at work,

NOTE confidence=0.99

272
00:57:15.199 --> 00:57:20.310
it's about the same. And I've had a lot of honest conversations with people and this is what I keep

NOTE confidence=0.937

273
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:26.679
hearing. Sometimes they say actually get more done at home because there's so many distractions at

NOTE confidence=0.766

274
00:57:26.689 --> 00:57:31.209
work. Some people say the opposite. I can't get anything done at home because there's so many

NOTE confidence=0.876

275
00:57:31.219 --> 00:57:39.100
distractions that I need to go to work. And what I've come to understand is that our system is not

NOTE confidence=0.585

276
00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.250
going to provide rest.

NOTE confidence=0.996

277
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.040
The only thing that can provide rest if we do things God's way

NOTE confidence=0.98

278
00:57:48.239 --> 00:57:56.399
and if you wanna see effectiveness really realized in your life, obey God more. And you will see

NOTE confidence=0.998

279
00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:02.639
that when you work for Jesus, when you work for the Lord, when you work to honor God, when he

NOTE confidence=0.997

280
00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:10.090
becomes your employer in all things, and the reason through which you work and rest your life is

NOTE confidence=0.996

281
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.139
truly blessed and holy.

NOTE confidence=0.996

282
00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:22.169
And I believe that God recompenses you. He rewards you. He renews you refreshes you. He replenishes

NOTE confidence=0.996

283
00:58:22.179 --> 00:58:31.360
you. He does all the things that you need him to do when we seek out what it looks like to relax his

NOTE confidence=0.9895

284
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:40.239
way. Look at what it says in verse 10, but the seventh day, well, this is 1/7 day that he says it

NOTE confidence=0.995

285
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:46.489
has to be dedicated to the Lord. Now, what we get from this is that it is a day that is supposed to

NOTE confidence=0.999

286
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.439
be about God.

NOTE confidence=0.462

287
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:58.129
And that means like if I go out and I don't know, I'm on a terrace in old Montreal, sipping a drink

NOTE confidence=0.996

288
00:58:58.139 --> 00:59:04.969
and talking with friends and experiencing rest. I want you to understand if I'm not connecting with

NOTE confidence=0.789

289
00:59:04.979 --> 00:59:16.199
God and if it isn't dedicated to God, that's not rest. That's just leisure. It's a pleasure if, if I

NOTE confidence=0.984

290
00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:23.320
am at the cottage and I'm sitting in an Adirondack chair and I'm facing the lake and I'm drinking a

NOTE confidence=0.996

291
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:28.139
beverage, any beverage I want. And maybe more than one.

NOTE confidence=0.981

292
00:59:33.649 --> 00:59:40.030
And I decide that this is the way that I'm going to rest. But I have no thoughts of God and very

NOTE confidence=0.996

293
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:48.209
little my time. My day, my moment, I'm enjoying creation, but I am not connected to the creator it

NOTE confidence=0.996

294
00:59:48.219 --> 00:59:49.149
is not rest.

NOTE confidence=0.996

295
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:59.090
You see my activity or my inactivity has nothing to do with rest. It actually has everything to do

NOTE confidence=0.996

296
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:07.110
with what I am doing in that moment of rest. And how that is either connected to God or disconnected

NOTE confidence=0.997

297
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:15.639
from Him. Is it dedicated to the Lord or not? So I can meet with someone have conversations, but

NOTE confidence=0.996

298
01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:20.870
they have to be conversations about God that bring me closer to an experience with God. Does that

NOTE confidence=0.996

299
01:00:20.879 --> 01:00:28.510
make sense? Then I retreat and I find personal time and I keep relating and connecting with God. And

NOTE confidence=0.998

300
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.840
I do that through worship and through prayer. And I do that through words and I do that through the

NOTE confidence=0.996

301
01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:40.159
conversations that I've had and I find myself connected to God. Sometimes I just sit in silence and

NOTE confidence=0.971

302
01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:46.169
I let God just speak to me any way that He wants and sometimes in that silence, he says nothing at

NOTE confidence=0.698

303
01:00:46.179 --> 01:00:53.239
all. But I feel connected to God. He doesn't need to speak just like I prefer it sometimes when my

NOTE confidence=0.997

304
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.870
wife next to me doesn't speak,

NOTE confidence=0.996

305
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:04.889
I love her next to me. I love her presence with me. I love being and doing life with her. But I

NOTE confidence=0.997

306
01:01:04.899 --> 01:01:06.379
don't always need her to be talking

NOTE confidence=0.985

307
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:15.510
just like I don't always need to be talking to her. Does that make sense? Say yes and then you have

NOTE confidence=0.996

308
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.909
to deal with her later. And,

NOTE confidence=0.552

309
01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:29.590
but I think you know what I mean? Sometimes when we practice the presence, it is more meaningful

NOTE confidence=0.996

310
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:37.320
than any words that can be shared. There is a threshold of intimacy there that can be crossed and

NOTE confidence=0.959

311
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:49.250
experienced that goes beyond words, but is seen in the trust and experience in the provision, in the

NOTE confidence=0.982

312
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:58.260
care and in the comfort of being with someone who's got your back. And when we experience that with

NOTE confidence=0.987

313
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:07.800
God, God is saying, do you trust me that much that you can stop from all of your activity and rest

NOTE confidence=0.66

314
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:16.520
and connect with me? Let's think about that. What does that day of rest look like for you? And

NOTE confidence=0.962

315
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:22.719
that's interesting because I think when I engage in activities, sometimes I don't know about you,

NOTE confidence=0.976

316
01:02:22.729 --> 01:02:33.280
but it can sometimes lead me into greater temptation just like sometimes by inactivity leads me into

NOTE confidence=0.594

317
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:44.469
temptation. You see, I know from experience firsthand that sometimes when I do nothing and I call it

NOTE confidence=0.838

318
01:02:44.479 --> 01:02:53.080
rest. I am more troubled in my mind and in my spirit and less connected to God than when I am active.

NOTE confidence=0.996

319
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:59.550
But in the same way that I can be active, I'm just active with whatever it is that I'm engaged with,

NOTE confidence=0.998

320
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:06.540
involved in doing and still not connected with God. Anyone else experience that and you find

NOTE confidence=0.996

321
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:11.659
yourself being tempted in your activity just like in your inactivity.

NOTE confidence=0.997

322
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:19.179
Sometimes the people, you end up spending time with the places you end up going, the things you end

NOTE confidence=0.997

323
01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:24.389
up laughing at the things that you end up thinking things that you end up saying the things that you

NOTE confidence=0.482

324
01:03:24.399 --> 01:03:29.340
end up doing those things don't lead you to rest. They lead you to moron rests

NOTE confidence=0.996

325
01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:38.949
even when those things are not sinful in and of themselves.

NOTE confidence=0.674

326
01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:48.179
And that's why Paul says that all things can be permissible but not everything is going to edify.

NOTE confidence=0.908

327
01:03:48.189 --> 01:03:58.320
You, build you up and bring you closer in your relationship with the creator who has given you seven

NOTE confidence=0.996

328
01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:10.550
days of enjoying His creation. Can you take one day and do something different with it and learn to

NOTE confidence=0.996

329
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:19.709
rest? I need to understand that when God says rest, I have six days to work and I have one day that

NOTE confidence=0.996

330
01:04:19.719 --> 01:04:28.280
I have to experience rest. He's saying I want you to experience me and all the gifts of creation

NOTE confidence=0.996

331
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:37.600
that I have given you. And if I can experience God and all the gifts of creation, all of them,

NOTE confidence=0.915

332
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:43.939
whatever they may be, whether they be in the city or in the countryside, whether it be alone or with

NOTE confidence=0.996

333
01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:51.139
people, whether it be drinking or eating or just sleeping or just resting in a way that brings me

NOTE confidence=0.972

334
01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:59.250
not to a place of dishonoring God, but honoring Him, then I know that I am practicing the day of

NOTE confidence=0.908

335
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:05.659
rest, the way that he intended. There was a time when the scriptures say that Adam and Eve were able

NOTE confidence=0.998

336
01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:13.409
to walk in the coolness of the garden with their creator. They had relationship, community

NOTE confidence=0.996

337
01:05:13.419 --> 01:05:20.679
connection. They were able to see everything that it meant to truly be with God. We struggle with

NOTE confidence=0.869

338
01:05:20.689 --> 01:05:26.709
all of those things. There's so many things always vying for our attention. We have internal and

NOTE confidence=0.996

339
01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:34.709
external forces, always working catastrophe in our lives, making sure that we never take rest. I

NOTE confidence=0.996

340
01:05:34.719 --> 01:05:42.080
know this to be true. But what if we are bold enough to act, to seize the moment and to say, I don't

NOTE confidence=0.996

341
01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:50.689
care what happens on the seventh day, I will take my rest and honor God. I will trust him because I

NOTE confidence=0.553

342
01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:56.639
have done everything I can in six days, everything I could do to try to save my marriage. In six

NOTE confidence=0.997

343
01:05:56.649 --> 01:06:02.760
days, I did it everything I could do to improve my relationship with my boyfriend, girlfriend,

NOTE confidence=0.984

344
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:10.449
fiance, whoever that person is, I did it, everything that I could do for my employer in six days, I

NOTE confidence=0.996

345
01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:17.239
did it. Everything I could do for my Children in six days, I offered everything and it's still not

NOTE confidence=0.996

346
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:26.719
enough I need to take my time and rest with God, with the God who gives me rest and gives me his

NOTE confidence=0.996

347
01:06:26.729 --> 01:06:33.370
gift to enjoy. I'm gonna trust God that everything I could do in six days, I've done it. But there's

NOTE confidence=0.991

348
01:06:33.379 --> 01:06:39.629
one day that day will remain blessed and holy and I'm gonna honor God with it. Imagine if we said

NOTE confidence=0.996

349
01:06:39.639 --> 01:06:48.090
those things, if we moved in that direction, something tells me we would experience a level of

NOTE confidence=0.996

350
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:53.439
multiplication that we had never experienced before. A level of blessing, a level of holiness, a

NOTE confidence=0.995

351
01:06:53.449 --> 01:07:05.570
level of connection with God and His creation that is unmatched in Hebrews 410. It promises this all

NOTE confidence=0.996

352
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:13.449
who entered into God's rest and rested from their labors just as God did after creating the world

NOTE confidence=0.996

353
01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:24.979
are going to experience the Sabbath. Rest, the Sabbath rest is for all those who stop working. The

NOTE confidence=0.956

354
01:07:24.989 --> 01:07:33.310
Sabbath rest is for everyone who ceases from their labors. So you're not experiencing a Sabbath rest.

NOTE confidence=0.949

355
01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:39.280
If you're still working, if you're still trying to fix things, if you're still trying to make it

NOTE confidence=0.996

356
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:47.540
happen through your own motivation, your own ingenuity, your own resources or the resources of

NOTE confidence=0.918

357
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:54.939
others, you're trying to bring blessing. When God is saying, why are you trying to bring blessing

NOTE confidence=0.996

358
01:07:54.949 --> 01:07:56.939
into your life when I'm your blessing?

NOTE confidence=0.961

359
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:05.280
Why are you trying to fix this when you can't? I can fix it though? Why are you trying to make it

NOTE confidence=0.996

360
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:11.689
better and improve it every day of the week? When your six days of effort haven't done anything at

NOTE confidence=0.845

361
01:08:11.699 --> 01:08:21.390
all? Not to the extent that they can. Aren't you ready to show me that you really trust me to do

NOTE confidence=0.997

362
01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:29.669
this for you? How many of you are ready to stop and to cease and to finally relax and let God do

NOTE confidence=0.996

363
01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.129
what he needs to do on our day of rest because you see when I rest, here's what you need to

NOTE confidence=0.999

364
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.049
understand God does not rest.

NOTE confidence=0.996

365
01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:51.009
God shows us the pattern of rest, but he doesn't rest from you. But I rest knowing that God

NOTE confidence=0.997

366
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:58.490
continues to be there for you and for me, I rest that I can't fix everything. As a pastor, I can't

NOTE confidence=0.997

367
01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:04.680
fix everything. As a life coach, I can't fix everything with my athletes or my community of faith. I

NOTE confidence=0.997

368
01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:13.330
know that I can't repair this world on my own. But I believe that when I rest, what I can do, God

NOTE confidence=0.999

369
01:09:13.339 --> 01:09:13.729
can

NOTE confidence=0.895

370
01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:23.168
and what I tried to do in six days, he could do it on the day that I just choose to rest and I could

NOTE confidence=0.714

371
01:09:23.179 --> 01:09:30.128
put my faith in Him. Anybody else want to do that today? Anybody else excited to try that. Anybody

NOTE confidence=0.483

372
01:09:30.139 --> 01:09:36.410
else wanna put God to the test. I want to show you something else. And it's in Psalm 46.

NOTE confidence=0.984

373
01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:49.850
And this passage says that he is able to be exalted among the nations and he is exalted in the earth

NOTE confidence=0.912

374
01:09:49.859 --> 01:10:02.370
when he has people, you and me who do this obey him in this be still and know that He is God.

NOTE confidence=0.542

375
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:16.299
The thing about this word be still in the sep in ancient Greek. In this version states this word

NOTE confidence=0.88

376
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:25.600
right here. Can we put it up? And the word is Jesus Chao. And the thing about this word is that

NOTE confidence=0.996

377
01:10:25.609 --> 01:10:34.729
sometimes it gets just interpreted wrongly because the thing about being still sometimes still

NOTE confidence=0.968

378
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:48.100
conveys that there is some kind of activity that is required from us. And that activity can

NOTE confidence=0.996

379
01:10:48.109 --> 01:10:53.520
sometimes be interpreted as I'm gonna do everything that I can. And then I'm gonna let God do

NOTE confidence=0.996

380
01:10:53.529 --> 01:10:59.390
everything that He can, which I think we've seen God says you have six days for that. But on the

NOTE confidence=0.775

381
01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:08.200
seventh day, I want you to rest. When the psalmist writes this, there are external and internal cata

NOTE confidence=0.997

382
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:18.549
catastrophes happening in the world. And this word can actually be translated. Relax. That's why we

NOTE confidence=0.977

383
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:29.729
call the series. Relax because the word be still means relax. It actually means just rest. It means

NOTE confidence=0.996

384
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:39.720
have leisure, it means let go, it means surrender. And so whenever this word keeps coming up, it's

NOTE confidence=0.967

385
01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:48.700
conveying all of these things. And interestingly enough, the Hebrew term for it is Rafa and the word

NOTE confidence=0.367

386
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:58.529
Rafa be still is rendered as let go. Relax. Stop.

NOTE confidence=0.996

387
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:05.830
I don't know about you, but stopping has never been my strong suit.

NOTE confidence=0.997

388
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:18.479
Even as a child, as I tortured my parents and my siblings, I would hear the word stop a lot and I

NOTE confidence=0.996

389
01:12:18.779 --> 01:12:27.390
refused to obey it. Even in Montreal, a stop sign just means just roll, slower,

NOTE confidence=0.995

390
01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:42.160
advance cautiously, but don't stop because the person behind you is thinking the same thing and

NOTE confidence=0.624

391
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:43.740
they're just going to hit you if you stop.

NOTE confidence=0.775

392
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:52.879
And so you just keep rolling, not at the same speed, just kind of rolling.

NOTE confidence=0.869

393
01:12:55.899 --> 01:13:04.589
And so we never stopped. Doesn't it feel like we never stop. And yet the commandment here is, are

NOTE confidence=0.997

394
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:12.879
you able to enter into a complete act of surrender, a release of striving and hostility? Are you

NOTE confidence=0.997

395
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:20.459
ready now to finally let go? It doesn't matter what is happening. Do you have an open mind for this?

NOTE confidence=0.996

396
01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:27.520
An open attitude for this? Are you ready to contemplate this? But more important? Are you actually

NOTE confidence=0.996

397
01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:34.189
ready to act on it by ceasing to act and just finally stop?

NOTE confidence=0.948

398
01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:44.620
I look at what it looks like in the scriptures to rest. And I see this steeping

NOTE confidence=0.758

399
01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:58.750
in creation sting in the creator. And it's interesting because I don't like tea,

NOTE confidence=0.977

400
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:10.569
I'll drink it, but I prefer coffee. In fact, this morning before even coming to church, I've already

NOTE confidence=0.757

401
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:21.000
had four. That's how much I love them and espressos, of course. Uh What else would I have? But and

NOTE confidence=0.996

402
01:14:21.009 --> 01:14:26.569
black, no sugar, no milk, just espressos. You want me to relax.

NOTE confidence=0.541

403
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.870
I'm having a very hard time right now.

NOTE confidence=0.903

404
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:44.549
I should probably relax from having so many espressos, but I just love them. And there's this thing

NOTE confidence=0.694

405
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.390
about me and my espresso and just sitting there and as short as they are. Hm, they're just so good.

NOTE confidence=0.597

406
01:14:52.740 --> 01:15:03.689
I just ST in my espresso. I want to ask you, can you deep in the presence of God? You know, you tea

NOTE confidence=0.429

407
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:14.140
drinkers, you like to steep your TB, you like to make sure that you get every ounce out of that

NOTE confidence=0.997

408
01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:21.149
combination. Of herbs and spices and you really taste what's going on there.

NOTE confidence=0.877

409
01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:33.229
I know that you steep it because you want to get every ounce of flavor out of that. I don't know

NOTE confidence=0.765

410
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:40.040
about you, but I am ready to experience every ounce of flavor that God has for all of us in his

NOTE confidence=0.91

411
01:15:40.049 --> 01:15:50.120
creation. And the way that he says that we get to experience that is by sting in his rest, sting in

NOTE confidence=0.987

412
01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:59.490
his presence, ceasing relaxing from all the things that we have worked at for six days. But it's now

NOTE confidence=0.423

413
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:05.689
time to trust him. I'll be ready to do that. I'll be ready to turn our attention to him in that way.

NOTE confidence=0.996

414
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:15.169
When we know God, we truly get to know ourselves. And I think sometimes we stay busy because we're

NOTE confidence=0.996

415
01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.970
scared about what we're about to find out.

NOTE confidence=0.558

416
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.549
We're worried about what he's going to show us. We're concerned about what he's going to be shouting

NOTE confidence=0.997

417
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.709
at us to stop. Imagine if I stop and start taking a day of rest. And then God says, you know that

NOTE confidence=0.552

418
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.959
relationship you're in, I don't want you to be in it. You're like I knew I shouldn't have stopped.

NOTE confidence=0.931

419
01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:44.700
Why did I rest? You know, that thing that you've been doing? I'm telling you that if you keep going

NOTE confidence=0.542

420
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:50.790
this way, it is going to lead to even greater destruction. You're like, but it gives me so much

NOTE confidence=0.406

421
01:16:50.799 --> 01:16:58.629
pleasure. Now, what it gives you is a dopamine hit and what it does is that it takes away more than

NOTE confidence=0.996

422
01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.419
it can ever give.

NOTE confidence=0.954

423
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:08.120
And instead of you experiencing rest, what you're experiencing is more unrest. You see when you stop

NOTE confidence=0.998

424
01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:10.689
and you relax and you let go and you surrender,

NOTE confidence=0.996

425
01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:22.109
you actually get to know God. And here's what happens is that as you know, God, God shows you not

NOTE confidence=0.996

426
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:33.540
just who he is but who you are. And then he says now that you know what I know, how about we walk to

NOTE confidence=0.999

427
01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.240
this new place together

NOTE confidence=0.764

428
01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:42.700
when my kids were little, they never used to want to leave the place they were in. And I discovered

NOTE confidence=0.996

429
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:49.029
that as a father, the only way I could get them to move from that place to another place was to say

NOTE confidence=0.996

430
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.270
these key words. Let's go to a new place.

NOTE confidence=0.809

431
01:17:56.339 --> 01:18:04.290
And my kids understood that a new place meant the unknown adventure, new possibilities and new

NOTE confidence=0.996

432
01:18:04.299 --> 01:18:11.649
experience. And as much as this was amazing, the idea that something could be more amazing

NOTE confidence=0.996

433
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:18.729
was enough to make them leave that place. Let me ask you something, you know why?

NOTE confidence=0.768

434
01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:26.040
OK, I was gonna say, let me ask you something but um we're out of time. So I'm just gonna tell you

NOTE confidence=0.999

435
01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:27.029
something. Is that OK?

NOTE confidence=0.905

436
01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:35.810
I'm just gonna get right to it. I'm gonna tell you something. The reason you don't leave the place

NOTE confidence=0.969

437
01:18:35.819 --> 01:18:39.370
you're in is because you don't think there's a better place to go to.

NOTE confidence=0.643

438
01:18:42.049 --> 01:18:48.580
But when God is the one showing you and telling you and promising to walk with you, guess what?

NOTE confidence=0.982

439
01:18:48.819 --> 01:18:54.080
You're ready to go there. But then you say, but God, the thing I have right now is the best thing

NOTE confidence=0.967

440
01:18:54.089 --> 01:19:02.930
I've had in a really long time. But what if God still says if you let this go? I've got for you a

NOTE confidence=0.999

441
01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:04.040
new place.

NOTE confidence=0.655

442
01:19:06.459 --> 01:19:15.600
Wouldn't you want to go? If God is the one leading you there, not you God, right? Because if it's me,

NOTE confidence=0.987

443
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:17.600
you know, I'm not a great guide.

NOTE confidence=0.763

444
01:19:21.939 --> 01:19:23.500
The best soul guide I know

NOTE confidence=0.998

445
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.080
is and always will be

NOTE confidence=0.998

446
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.120
the Holy Spirit.

NOTE confidence=0.993

447
01:19:33.439 --> 01:19:42.140
The Holy Spirit wants to lead us to that new place. Let's go together and let's experience our rest.

NOTE confidence=0.999

448
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:43.700
God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

NOTE confidence=0.715

449
01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:57.080
Would you stand as we just close in a word of prayer? And I want to pray with you and the service

NOTE confidence=0.86

450
01:19:57.089 --> 01:20:02.810
isn't over, but it's just me wanting to take this moment for us to pray together. The band's coming

NOTE confidence=0.57

451
01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:09.149
back up and they're going to sing a song uh with us that is gonna help us to just make this that

NOTE confidence=0.771

452
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:15.580
much more meaningful for each of us. And then, you know, wait for our M CS to dismiss us. And I just

NOTE confidence=0.699

453
01:20:15.589 --> 01:20:19.540
want to thank you for being a part of this gathering, to being a part of this community for

NOTE confidence=0.93

454
01:20:19.549 --> 01:20:26.740
journeying together for taking time out of your busy life and schedule. Um to make this your, your

NOTE confidence=0.763

455
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:33.290
day of rest and your moment of rest. And I just want to preface this by saying, um,

NOTE confidence=0.981

456
01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:43.330
rest isn't, you know, coming to church for all of us. I cannot rest on a Sunday. Makes sense, right?

NOTE confidence=0.684

457
01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:50.109
I can't rest on a Saturday because I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm working, getting ready for today. In fact,

NOTE confidence=0.998

458
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:58.029
if I don't take a day of rest, I can't function at the level that I need to, to do the things that I

NOTE confidence=0.987

459
01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:04.149
need to do in the same way that Sunday may not be a day of rest for you because you had to get up

NOTE confidence=0.996

460
01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.979
early, you had to come to church,

NOTE confidence=0.998

461
01:21:10.089 --> 01:21:20.899
but it was something that still falls into what is important, but not necessarily giving you that

NOTE confidence=0.996

462
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:27.770
connection and that rest that you need. Sometimes we come to church and something disrupts our

NOTE confidence=0.634

463
01:21:27.779 --> 01:21:33.799
connection and that can happen because community is messy.

NOTE confidence=0.992

464
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:41.470
But I know that God can still teach us and show us

NOTE confidence=0.996

465
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:53.330
how when and where to experience rest. Are you ready to go on that journey together? And so father,

NOTE confidence=0.869

466
01:21:53.339 --> 01:22:02.220
I want to thank you for every person that by you has already been called blessed and holy, created

NOTE confidence=0.996

467
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:14.669
for amazing purposes to accomplish and to do great things. But to also experience a great God. And I

NOTE confidence=0.504

468
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:23.950
pray Lord that we would not settle for accomplish this MS when we can experience relationships and

NOTE confidence=0.996

469
01:22:23.959 --> 01:22:35.779
experience a relationship with you I pray that we would work for those six days and we would find

NOTE confidence=0.996

470
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:45.919
rest on the seventh and that we would find time to connect with you and all the gifts that you have

NOTE confidence=0.996

471
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:56.850
given to us through your creation. I pray that you draw us closer to you and that you would help us

NOTE confidence=0.992

472
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.200
to get to that new place together. And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Would you receive

NOTE confidence=0.836

473
01:23:06.209 --> 01:23:12.229
that blessing and that prayer? And let's sing this song together. Would you welcome the river's edge

NOTE confidence=0.997

474
01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.810
worship team? Thank you so much.

NOTE confidence=0.579

475
01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:34.339
Create a stare at the stone. Before again,

NOTE confidence=0.458

476
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:48.700
spoke to the dark and fleshed out the

NOTE confidence=0.765

477
01:23:56.129 --> 01:23:56.830
that you

NOTE confidence=0.925

517
01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:16.600
Thank you. Worship team. Well, that brings us to the close of this morning's service as a chronic

NOTE confidence=0.992

518
01:30:16.609 --> 01:30:21.640
busy body. I think there was a word for me in here today. We hope there was one for you as well

NOTE confidence=0.999

519
01:30:22.029 --> 01:30:31.129
before you leave, please do not leave without receiving prayer. We have a prayer team who is ready

NOTE confidence=0.996

520
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:39.009
to pray with you to join with you. Um If there's something on your heart, don't leave with it, still

NOTE confidence=0.997

521
01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:47.660
there, meet with us on my right and they will join with you in corporate prayer and keep in mind

NOTE confidence=0.996

522
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:53.060
that we have next steps. Uh Roots is pretty much everyone's next step. I've actually done it with

NOTE confidence=0.996

523
01:30:53.069 --> 01:30:58.390
the worship team. Uh On Thursday nights, it actually opens up your eyes to a lot of little things

NOTE confidence=0.995

524
01:30:58.399 --> 01:31:02.879
that if you've walked with Christ for a long time, you actually tend to miss some of these key

NOTE confidence=0.995

525
01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:08.470
important things. But uh you got roots that would lead into baptism to alpha boundaries, they're all

NOTE confidence=0.676

526
01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:16.500
very important. Um So it's a, it's a great place to start. Um Also after party, uh there's cold

NOTE confidence=0.978

527
01:31:16.509 --> 01:31:21.580
refreshments. I know it's a little bit hot in here, especially with more people. Um So everyone make

NOTE confidence=0.803

528
01:31:21.589 --> 01:31:28.379
sure you stop by the uh the afterparty and talk to somebody you haven't talked to. Um honest, it's a

NOTE confidence=0.997

529
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:34.859
great place to get connected. And with that, have a great week. Everyone take care, have a great

NOTE confidence=0.997

530
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:35.339
week.
