Jesus, thank you for loving us. Lord. We lift our praise to you. Lord, you alone are worthy. You are

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.159
alone. All the applause, all the adulation. Father, meet us today. Lord, you bless your name.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.679
Hey, while we're at it, would you guys welcome our new, our shiny new toy Ian. He's on the perks. It

35
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.369
is the first time with us today. We got double trouble on the, on the drums.

100
00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:13.540
Hey man, you got some praise this morning.

101
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:49.530
Alright, good morning River's Edge. Thank you, worship team for finishing the goodness of God. I don't know,

102
00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:57.969
be crying and I haven't even started my presentation. So thank you, worship team. All right. My name

103
00:24:57.979 --> 00:25:06.630
is Patricia and I'm here today to speak about a beautiful mission that God has graced me with. Um

104
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:13.829
five years ago, I started a little foundation and I actually started this foundation before knowing

105
00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:20.500
Jesus. So what I want to share with you today is how God revealed himself to me through this work.

106
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:25.349
And I'll also talk about the actual projects that we are working on today.

107
00:25:27.969 --> 00:25:36.849
And so the name of the foundation is Anna and Anna is a Hebrew word from the Bible meaning meek,

108
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:43.670
humble afflicted. And you can find it throughout the Bible, for example, sermon on the Mount Matthew

109
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:52.569
55 blessed are the meek blessed are the Anna for they shall inherit the earth. And another

110
00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:58.680
translation that I like that is close to my heart is outcast for, I feel these are the types of

111
00:25:58.689 --> 00:26:04.829
communities that God has been leading me to. It's also a feeling that I struggled a lot when I was

112
00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:12.589
younger and I think it's something that we can all relate to at least once in our lives. So how did

113
00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:18.219
this all start? Well, it all started with me being completely delusional and having ideas of

114
00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:25.780
grandeur that I will go to Tanzania and I will open an orphanage and I will save lots of kids. But

115
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:35.229
God, God had another plan. And while I was in Tanzania, he led me to volunteer at this outdoor

116
00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:41.250
traditional medicine men herbalist hospital. It was a very difficult place. There were many, many

117
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:49.199
sick people, but this is where I met Maliki, this beautiful boy Maliki is partially paralyzed and he

118
00:26:49.209 --> 00:26:57.420
was abandoned by his family except for Bibi, his grandmother who was taking care of Maliki. And so I

119
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:05.199
would spend every day, all day with B B in Maliki and with many, many other Children, of course, um

120
00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:12.420
it did not take long for God to humble me and to show me that I did not deserve to be next to these

121
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:18.979
beautiful kids. And I certainly didn't deserve to take care of them. And it didn't take long for God

122
00:27:18.989 --> 00:27:27.260
to show me that I was the one that truly needed saving. So he humbled me 100 times a day. And I have

123
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:33.760
so many stories, I wish I could share with you. But one that I do like is um BB and Maliki were

124
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.900
very poor. So they would eat boiled green bananas for breakfast, boiled green bananas for lunch and

125
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:44.359
same thing for dinner. And the first time that they asked me to eat with them, I remember both of

126
00:27:44.369 --> 00:27:50.180
them just like digging through the pot and arguing with each other. And when I came to realize that

127
00:27:50.189 --> 00:27:57.020
they were looking for the best green banana to offer me. Now, I know it sounds very trivial. But

128
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.780
when this kind of thing happens like 100 times a day and God is showing you who you truly are and

129
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:07.349
it's actually not that nice and you're not that good because I was more kind of like Joey from

130
00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:13.250
friends. I don't know if you remember him, but he didn't like to share his food. That was who I was.

131
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:22.500
So, especially not my French fries. And uh the next slide is our little friend Isa. Now I remember

132
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:30.520
meeting Isa and I was just in awe of him, his humility. You can see it in his eyes, in his demeanor.

133
00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:40.219
I had never seen that before and I had certainly not seen it in me. He's just so beautiful. And then

134
00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:46.900
God led me to Sri Lanka. And it's in Sri Lanka that he taught me about joy. So I was volunteering at

135
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:53.920
the rubber plantation for six months. A kind priest was gracious enough to let me stay at his parish,

136
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.180
which we can see in that middle picture, the big building is the rubber factory. And then next to it

137
00:28:59.189 --> 00:29:05.459
was our church which was obviously really far in the middle of nowhere. And so he would leave during

138
00:29:05.469 --> 00:29:10.939
the week and come back on the weekends. Um So I would be in charge of all the kids and I would try

139
00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:16.310
to organize activities for them. But there were so many Children and we had the Hindu kids and the

140
00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:21.689
Catholic kids, they would come, they would fight, they'd be climbing on the roof, they'd be going

141
00:29:21.699 --> 00:29:26.500
through my things sometimes all of this at the same time. And it was really, honestly just me and I

142
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:34.239
didn't speak the language, obviously. Um It was extremely chaotic but it was also the most fun six

143
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:41.479
months of my life because these kids were just so joyful. Um I would say that they took better care

144
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:47.790
of me than I did of them. The girls would be braiding my hair, cooking and cleaning for me. The boys

145
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.500
would be walking me through the jungle, holding my hands, carrying my bags and you could just see it

146
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:59.680
from the pictures, how they're just filled with joy. And the next video I really love. I look at it

147
00:29:59.689 --> 00:30:07.920
all the time. It just shows how I spent my days for six months with them having fun. Well, it's

148
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.030
better with the sound but it's still pretty awesome. Oh, there they are.

149
00:30:20.869 --> 00:30:27.849
Then COVID happened and God brought me back home to Canada and he led me to work as a high school

150
00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:33.650
math teacher on the First Nations Reserve. And this is the year that God taught me about

151
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:41.160
faithfulness. This is the year that God basically rid me and emptied me of anything that might get

152
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:48.209
in the way between Him and I and this mission. And I, because you see up to this point, I still had

153
00:30:48.219 --> 00:30:54.510
my own dreams and my own plans and my own idea of how my life should be. But God got rid of that

154
00:30:54.750 --> 00:31:03.319
that year. And this is also the year where I was very, very mad at God, but we made it through and

155
00:31:03.329 --> 00:31:10.750
he led me to Madagascar and in Madagascar is where I learned how to trust Him. I learned how to hear

156
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:18.030
his voice to follow it and to obey. Madagascar is a very, very poor country. It's the fourth poorest

157
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:24.410
country in the world. And there are many, many street Children. And when I arrived, I saw this one

158
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:31.280
boy begging and God placed him on my heart and he told me you must find him again. And I looked and

159
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:37.609
searched for him for weeks until this beautiful, beautiful blessed day where God brought us together

160
00:31:37.619 --> 00:31:44.349
again. And I remember this day so well, I remember I bent down, he was looking at the ground, so he

161
00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:52.089
lifted his head up and our eyes met and he just gave me the most magnificent smile and we didn't say

162
00:31:52.099 --> 00:31:58.839
anything at all for, for a long time. And it was really just as if we had known each other forever.

163
00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:07.290
And as if we had told each other that we would meet here at this day, at this place at this time and

164
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:13.349
I knew it was all God. So you have to understand like I know that God doesn't need me. I know that

165
00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:20.280
God can do this all by himself, but he is so good that he wants to share this with us. He wants to

166
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:29.560
share it with you. The joy of knowing these kids and the joy of loving these Children. Ok? The next,

167
00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:35.969
the next slide is a bit graphic. So please, if you don't want to see it, just close your eyes. So

168
00:32:35.979 --> 00:32:43.130
our little friend, he had leprosy and tuberculosis. So he was losing his fingers, his toe toes. He

169
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:51.280
was covered in sores. That, that one you can see. Um at night he would get eaten, bitten by rats

170
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:57.540
every night. He's from a family of big of 10 kids. So he was out on the streets begging for money

171
00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:05.369
for the family. Um He's doing so well today and we'll talk more about that later. But what I do want

172
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:11.359
to talk about first is just how again, amazing God is. So I admit I had a bit of a panic attack at

173
00:33:11.369 --> 00:33:16.680
the beginning. So I was in my room and here I was, I didn't know anything about leprosy other than

174
00:33:16.689 --> 00:33:22.800
what I had read in the Bible. So I'm thinking, I'm freaking out actually, it's like 10 minutes. But

175
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:29.979
I'm thinking, oh, and there is also an outbreak of the plague in Madagascar which gets spreads to

176
00:33:29.989 --> 00:33:35.780
through rats. So I was freaking out thinking what if I'm not gonna be the girl who's helping kids,

177
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.969
but I'm gonna be the girl who brings the plague back to Canada. And God is so good. He did not

178
00:33:40.979 --> 00:33:46.599
entertain me, my craziness for too long. He answered me right away. I was reading the Book of Acts

179
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.579
and he told me do not call anything impure that I have made clean. And he was telling me that this

180
00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:57.619
boy was healed and he might not look healed. The doctors might not think he's healed, but he was

181
00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.430
healed by the power of Jesus.

182
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:09.949
And then after all that, God brought me home and here I am. So what do we actually do? So remember

183
00:34:09.959 --> 00:34:15.110
at the beginning, I said I wanted to open an orphanage. When I started the process, I came to

184
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:20.939
realize that most Children that are in these institutions actually have living family members that

185
00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:26.290
would take care of them. Sometimes even living parents. When I was on the plantations, I saw the

186
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:33.020
moms leave for work for the Middle East as house cleaners, maids sometimes never coming back. And in

187
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:38.629
Madagascar, I saw the kids on the streets and terrible things can happen to these Children,

188
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:45.909
kidnappings and much, much worse. So what we are trying to do as a mission is to keep these families

189
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:52.969
together because we know that the enemy's plan is to destroy the family unit. So how do we do that?

190
00:34:54.938 --> 00:35:01.989
So we work with our local leaders and in Tanzania, we have a, he's been with us since even before we

191
00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:07.549
started. I know him where we would dream about it together in Tanzania and he's been nothing but

192
00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:13.779
faithful and perseverant. I think he's had malaria at least a dozen times since we started. His

193
00:35:13.789 --> 00:35:21.790
heart is set on this mission and nothing else in Madagascar. We work with Dina and who founded M M F

194
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:27.300
Music Changes Lives. It's a beautiful, beautiful place where the street kids can come and learn how

195
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:34.370
to read and write and play music and this is where a little friend is today. It's a wonderful place

196
00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:43.489
filled with the love of Jesus. In Sri Lanka, we work with who a few years ago had a vision from God

197
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.510
about the work that she was called to do on these foundations um on these plantations, sorry

198
00:35:49.719 --> 00:35:56.530
plantations are difficult places where child abuse child marriages are common. So she's fighting

199
00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:05.379
this through uh sharing the gospel, providing teachers, family counseling and community kitchens. We

200
00:36:05.389 --> 00:36:09.949
have our different programs that we adjust depending on each family. So we have our monthly food

201
00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:16.510
baskets. We provide health care emergency aids. So anything from transportation to medication skills

202
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:23.449
training. So um like for example, tailoring for single moms or gardening shoe making for disabled

203
00:36:23.459 --> 00:36:29.639
young people. And we have our school program where we provide uniforms, books, pencils, anything a

204
00:36:29.649 --> 00:36:32.129
child needs to go to school for a whole year.

205
00:36:35.449 --> 00:36:41.699
Our current project is we want to renovate M M F the Center for the street kids in Madagascar

206
00:36:41.709 --> 00:36:46.520
because unfortunately, as I said, there are many more out there and we just want to accommodate more

207
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:55.189
Children. Ok, everyone's favorite section. How can you help before I continue? I just want to

208
00:36:55.199 --> 00:37:00.629
clarify one thing with you guys. I'm not here trying to make anyone feel guilty about anything.

209
00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:05.120
That's not what I'm trying to do. But what I am trying to do is to show you guys that we have an

210
00:37:05.129 --> 00:37:13.080
opportunity. We have an opportunity to be the hands and feet of Jesus. We have an opportunity to put

211
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:20.330
our faith at work and to show this world to show this city what Jesus can do through broken people

212
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:30.030
like me and like you. Um because one day you'll hear my testimony and you'll understand everything

213
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:36.860
that God has delivered me from. And everything that he's forgiven me of and that all this the kids,

214
00:37:36.899 --> 00:37:43.959
the foundation, but especially me, especially me is, is a miracle. It's a miracle that only Jesus

215
00:37:43.969 --> 00:37:44.489
can do.

216
00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:52.270
Ok. Last thing almost done. So remember, OK. No, wait, how can you help? Let's talk about that.

217
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:59.429
Prayers. Please pray for us, pray for the kids, pray that God will lead us to more Children. Um Pray

218
00:37:59.439 --> 00:38:07.189
for the, for, for our leaders, pray for me donations. Obviously, we need money to do what we do. Um

219
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:13.090
Sometimes I don't like the word donate. I see it more as an exchange because God has been so good to

220
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:20.989
us. And when we give back what he gives back or what the kids give back is just so much better. Uh

221
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.320
Follow us on Instagram and donor. See, donor see is this really amazing donation platform where we

222
00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:34.189
can put up videos. Please forgive me because I'm very new to this social media game. So it's taking

223
00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:40.639
me time. I'm learning on my own and oh, please come and talk to me because today I gave you this

224
00:38:40.649 --> 00:38:46.360
sweet short version and I left out all the fear and the loneliness and the hopelessness. All the

225
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:53.729
times I called crying to my mom like a big baby. I left out all the the fever, the malaria, the

226
00:38:53.739 --> 00:39:01.040
diarrhea, the mosquito bites, the skin rashes, the hair loss. That was a really hard one, but it's

227
00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:08.860
OK. Now praise the Lord. Um I left out all the snakes and the scorpions and the wild dog attacks and

228
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.149
the false accusations, the blackmail. So please come and talk to me because I love to talk about

229
00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:21.479
this, obviously. Ok. So now we're almost done. So remember a little friend of the boy with leprosy

230
00:39:22.739 --> 00:39:27.709
at the beginning, it was really hard to find the right help for him because they haven't had a case

231
00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:32.620
in a long time. So they say, and we couldn't find the medication. There was a shortage. So we had to

232
00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:38.280
wait for a shipment. So I was encouraging him every day. I would see him and I'm like, when you're

233
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.469
better and the doctor says it's ok, you're gonna be able to go to M M F, they're gonna teach you how

234
00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:46.709
to dance. They're gonna teach you how to play music. Um, and I was like, do you know how to dance?

235
00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:50.979
He's like, I don't know how to dance. I was like, ok, it's ok. We have time to practice if you want,

236
00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:57.560
I could show you my moves. So it became like our daily joke. And just last month they sent me this

237
00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:06.469
beautiful video of him and the other Children at the center in the park and he is dancing with his

238
00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:06.959
friends.

239
00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:12.510
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

240
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:21.429
Now, I don't know if I said it enough, but only Jesus can do that. Thank you.

241
00:40:32.629 --> 00:40:35.050
She did pretty good eh?

242
00:40:38.129 --> 00:40:44.040
And it's an amazing work um that she's doing with uh and through Ana and this is the foundation that

243
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:49.620
she actually started. And so I'm so impressed with this uh woman right here. And one of the things

244
00:40:49.629 --> 00:40:56.209
that we wanted to do as a community of faith as we keep, you know, just taking the next steps is

245
00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:01.810
taking the next step, even with our women's ministry here at River's Edge. And so I wanted to just

246
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:09.239
take this opportunity to announce that uh Patricia is now going to be our women's ministry leader uh

247
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.189
at River's Edge. Can we welcome her?

248
00:41:15.149 --> 00:41:21.489
Um And the ministry is called uh girls. And the reason we call it girls is because it's for women of

249
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:29.600
all ages. It's really for anyone who's 18 and up 17 even. And uh and it's sometimes women's ministry

250
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:35.229
in the past has always been geared towards uh married women and maybe geared towards motherhood and,

251
00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:41.929
and to older women. But really our ministries is geared to women of all ages. And so that's why it's

252
00:41:41.939 --> 00:41:48.060
called girls. And we have also two events that we're gonna uh share more about and that's gonna be

253
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:52.189
over the next little bit. But the first one that we're gonna talk to you about is it's called

254
00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:58.290
unlikely royalty. And um and then Emma Day is gonna come up and just share more about uh this event

255
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:05.469
as well. And the other one that we have coming up is in August and that one is going to be a larger

256
00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:10.320
event, which is a simul cast. It's gonna be a live event that we're going to do right here um at

257
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:15.550
Rivers Edge and it's gonna be August the 26th. And so just before we continue with the rest of the

258
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:21.800
gathering, I want to take this opportunity uh to ask you to just stand for one moment and pray with

259
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:27.870
me as we pray over Patricia, we're ready to do that as she takes on this huge role here at River's

260
00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:32.739
Edge and it's gonna be an important one. Um And then if you want to just encourage her and speak to

261
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.530
her, whether it be about the women's ministry or her foundation, uh she'll be available at the back

262
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.840
table at the end. And so father, we want to thank you for Patricia for her life for the way that you

263
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:48.090
have blessed her to start this foundation, but also put her on her heart to lead this ministry at

264
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.610
our community. And we thank you for the way that you're going to bless her in her teaching gift and

265
00:42:53.810 --> 00:43:00.189
in her leadership gift and also in her ability to continue to be compassionate and caring for

266
00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:08.010
whoever it is that would need that advice and wisdom and experience from both her past, but also

267
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:14.600
from the scriptures as she continues to study them so that she can give the right word for the right

268
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:22.649
season in the woman's life as she would need it. We thank you for these events that she's planned

269
00:43:22.659 --> 00:43:27.790
and, and that she will be promoting and, and just for the work that she's going to be doing with the

270
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:33.310
women that are going to surround her and do this ministry with her. It's a new season for our

271
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:39.750
community of faith, a new season, even a ministry for her life as she steps into this new and

272
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.139
powerful role here, we thank you God that it's powerful, not because of the position, but because of

273
00:43:45.149 --> 00:43:51.290
your presence, because of your spirit and because of your word in her life, shining through,

274
00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:57.810
touching the lives of those that need it most. And we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.

275
00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.739
Thank you everybody.

276
00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.270
And um Emma is gonna come out and just continue with some announcements,

277
00:44:18.949 --> 00:44:25.149
announcements, announcements, announcements. So kids, you can be dismissed parents, you can take the

278
00:44:25.159 --> 00:44:31.060
Children to the annex for their programming for the morning. There are some excellent teachers

279
00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.100
waiting on your kids.

280
00:44:35.169 --> 00:44:41.540
So um we're so thankful for Patricia and everything that she's doing here. And we're really excited

281
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:51.399
to announce our first women's ministry event. Uh June 17th, unlikely royalty. Please, ladies come on

282
00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:59.620
out to that invite a friend to come with you. Uh There will be food and worship and uh teaching and

283
00:44:59.629 --> 00:45:05.399
it's just gonna be a really lovely time to get to know other women in the community and to just

284
00:45:05.409 --> 00:45:14.179
again, have an encounter with God um as a unit together on June 17th Saturday here at 10 AM. Uh So

285
00:45:14.189 --> 00:45:20.989
please come out to that. And our second uh event is August 26th. I'm not gonna tell you too, too,

286
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:29.080
too, too much about that. But if you don't know Priscilla Schrier, she is a powerful speaker. We did a

287
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:35.750
a similar event a few years ago and it was an amazing success. Again, food, the church was filled

288
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:43.350
with women and it was a lovely, lovely time. So mark your calendars. August 26th, prepare to come

289
00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:51.129
and join us for that event. Uh We have a praise report. We're so so thankful that we finally have

290
00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:58.110
all of the volunteers that we need for the children's ministry. So that's amazing. Yes, let's clap

291
00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.649
for that. That's a blessing.

292
00:46:02.379 --> 00:46:11.100
So we have all of the teachers and now we are looking for musical people perhaps uh to rotate

293
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:18.820
through week to week, to do children's worship. So we want to teach the Children how to worship God

294
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:25.939
in music and in song. And so if you were musically inclined, uh we would love your talents uh to

295
00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:33.750
play some music for our kids in the annex on Sunday on a rotational basis. So keep that in mind tech

296
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:41.560
team, we do still have a need for volunteers in the tech team. It takes a community to put on on the

297
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:48.300
church events on Sundays and to do our tech, you do not have to know what you were doing. So you are

298
00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:54.280
going to be trained. Ok? So there's no pressure, you're gonna be completely trained and supported in

299
00:46:54.290 --> 00:47:03.350
that. And we would love to have you help us and finally community kitchen. So we're having another

300
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:11.169
brunch here on Sunday May 26th after the gathering. And if you have not participated in a community

301
00:47:11.179 --> 00:47:17.725
kitchen lunch, you have missed out. It is an excellent time again to come and meet people after the

302
00:47:17.735 --> 00:47:26.955
service. Have a fantastic meal and uh just enjoy each other's company. So May 26th, after the

303
00:47:26.965 --> 00:47:34.919
gathering, do not run away, we have food for you and we always have four ways to give here at

304
00:47:34.929 --> 00:47:40.870
River's Edge. You're not obliged. However, it is an act of faith and we do have a vision for the

305
00:47:40.879 --> 00:47:46.350
church and our ministries inside and outside of the church. So it is also an act of unity to

306
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.510
participate in the vision if you believe in what we are doing and what we are saying and how we are

307
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:57.719
reaching out to people beyond us. So there are four ways to give to make it convenient for you. But

308
00:47:57.729 --> 00:48:04.260
as always pray about it and see what God puts on your heart to help us with. So let's prepare

309
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:10.020
ourselves. Pastor Lorenzo is coming back out with his message for us today. Have a good service.

310
00:48:19.649 --> 00:48:26.620
I'm so bored. I wish I had something to do. Thanks for letting me sleep in kids. If you make a mess

311
00:48:26.629 --> 00:48:32.600
in the kitchen, please let me know so I can clean it up. Raising kids is so easy. I just love

312
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:38.000
driving around all day. Oh, I never have to repeat myself. They always listen so carefully. Oh, look

313
00:48:38.929 --> 00:48:44.969
an empty box of cereal. Love it. Just wipe it on your sleeve. It's pretty cold. But you don't need a

314
00:48:44.979 --> 00:48:49.879
coat. Oh, you don't have to push in your chair. Don't make your bed. You're just gonna sleep in it

315
00:48:49.889 --> 00:48:54.580
again later. I think I'll skip the coffee today. You know, these throat pillows look way better on

316
00:48:54.590 --> 00:49:00.209
the floor. I'm really not that busy. Well, you haven't showered in three days but I think you smell

317
00:49:00.219 --> 00:49:05.699
great. We do have food at home, but let's just go out to eat, just brush your teeth whenever you

318
00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:09.889
feel like it here. Take my phone charger and go put it in your room. Oh, just leave your dirty

319
00:49:09.899 --> 00:49:16.840
dishes on the counter in Jesus' name. We pray. Amen. All right, let's all pull on our phones. Youth

320
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:23.590
sports are so cheap. Braces are so cheap. School fees are so cheap. Hey, can you come call in bed

321
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.310
with me around two AM? Thanks. Ok. I just spent two hours making dinner. But if you don't like it,

322
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.949
that's fine. Just let me know and I'll make you something else. Don't even bother looking for that.

323
00:49:33.959 --> 00:49:39.169
I'm sure it's lost and gone forever. Can somebody please throw something at my head? I mean, I can

324
00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:44.659
keep track of every single go one of your things. I get a ton of sleep. I get a ton of gratitude

325
00:49:44.669 --> 00:49:49.530
from my Children. I get a ton of unsolicited help at the housework. Oh, you don't have to hurry up.

326
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.110
We're gonna be right on time. Can someone please throw something at the TV? Thanks for doing the

327
00:49:54.120 --> 00:50:00.419
laundry. Everyone. I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Can you use your outside voice? Fight, fight, fight.

328
00:50:00.429 --> 00:50:06.030
The floor of this vehicle is so clean. I can't believe it. Oh, good. Another trip to the grocery

329
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.399
store today. Let's go.

330
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:18.340
I'm gonna hop in the shower. Does somebody want to come use the bathroom while I'm in here?

331
00:50:29.629 --> 00:50:36.419
A lot of you can relate on both sides of that? Maybe experience. We're so glad that you could be

332
00:50:36.429 --> 00:50:41.070
here for Mother's Day. I think it's amazing. Can you applaud yourselves for being here and just

333
00:50:41.239 --> 00:50:49.169
being a part of, of this gathering? And uh we're excited to, to give you guys um a gift at the end.

334
00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:54.429
Uh for all the women in the house, we just want to give that and bless you with something that um

335
00:50:54.449 --> 00:51:00.060
our team has put together and we're just so blessed to be able to do that today. Um Just to say that

336
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:05.340
we appreciate you and uh we love you in whatever, you know, phase of life that you find yourself in

337
00:51:05.649 --> 00:51:09.939
and uh that you would be able to enjoy that on this day. We know that this day is not easy for

338
00:51:09.949 --> 00:51:17.409
everyone. It's not something that we can all just participate in and just feel good about. And we

339
00:51:17.419 --> 00:51:24.110
wanna be sensitive to that and also know that God is with you no matter what your childhood has been

340
00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.050
like, no matter what your present life is like, whether your kids, you know, have been respectful

341
00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:35.500
and honoring of you and maybe not, um whether your mom was maybe absent in your life and, and maybe

342
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:40.810
you just haven't even experienced motherhood and, and that's been maybe something that's been quite

343
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:46.379
painful and difficult in your life and in your journey because of the way that things have gone so

344
00:51:46.389 --> 00:51:52.620
far, whatever the situation and the circumstance, I want you to know that that God always has a

345
00:51:52.629 --> 00:51:59.870
purpose. And even when we learn about things that we may not think this is for me. I want you to

346
00:51:59.879 --> 00:52:04.979
understand that scriptures doesn't work like that. When we study the scriptures, it's all for you

347
00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:12.169
because everything that you learn for yourself, you also have the greatest opportunity in this world

348
00:52:12.179 --> 00:52:17.959
to be able to bless someone else with it. And so today, even if we talk about mothers and you may

349
00:52:17.969 --> 00:52:24.260
maybe just check out and disconnect from the topic, don't do that because you need to understand

350
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:28.899
this because these principles are not just for you, they're for someone else and more importantly,

351
00:52:28.909 --> 00:52:34.439
they can be for you at a phase and time in your life in which God may bring someone or something

352
00:52:34.449 --> 00:52:40.209
into your life at that specific moment in time where everything you're about to hear today is going

353
00:52:40.219 --> 00:52:47.750
to possibly even save your life. That was a joke. But uh but you'd never know.

354
00:52:50.379 --> 00:52:58.889
Yeah. So I know that the scriptures have saved me and my marriage many times. This kind of wisdom

355
00:52:58.899 --> 00:53:03.300
has made it possible for me to be not only a better man, but a better husband and a better father,

356
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:11.370
but also just a better person to be the person who supports and encourages my wife. I want to speak

357
00:53:11.379 --> 00:53:17.169
to you today about this topic that I think we can all connect and relate to no matter what and that

358
00:53:17.179 --> 00:53:23.370
is cultivating gifts and talents. And I think one of the things that we sometimes underestimate is

359
00:53:23.379 --> 00:53:31.209
how important this is in the role of just motherhood. In fact, the Bible does speak a lot about this

360
00:53:31.219 --> 00:53:37.419
topic and I wanted to focus and zero in on just three specific areas that I think can really speak

361
00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:42.979
to you about the role that God has given you. But also the person that you need to be, even if you

362
00:53:42.989 --> 00:53:49.969
haven't had that role in your life, how God can be this person in your life. And it's hard to talk

363
00:53:49.979 --> 00:53:56.679
about God as a mother. But God is seen as a mother in the Scriptures in many instances. And we need

364
00:53:56.689 --> 00:54:02.040
to understand that God overall is spirit. And while we use the pronoun as he, and obviously, we're

365
00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:09.179
talking about him as a father, we're also unsure of why we never ever talked to about God in the

366
00:54:09.189 --> 00:54:16.250
context of motherhood. But Jesus himself when he wept over Jerusalem over a city that God had given

367
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:25.919
him to be king over and a future Jerusalem that would one day be ushered in in the future. He says

368
00:54:26.439 --> 00:54:39.000
that he wanted to gather his people under his wings, like a hen gathers her chicks. And this is

369
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:46.429
Jesus speaking, but we don't like to talk about that because we, we don't want to see God in that

370
00:54:46.439 --> 00:54:53.149
context because it kind of disturbs us or bothers us. But we need to understand that that God

371
00:54:53.159 --> 00:55:01.010
allowed Jesus to say something that was very much about motherhood in the context in which he's only

372
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:10.010
seen as a powerful father and God in a patriarchal society. And that was intentional on his part.

373
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:18.939
And so when we look in Proverbs in chapter 22 verse six, it says that we are to start Children off

374
00:55:18.949 --> 00:55:27.550
on the way that they should go and even when they are old, they will not turn from it. And that's

375
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:37.060
encouraging because sometimes we see our kids not interested, not caring about what role God is to

376
00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:43.239
have in their life. And I was actually one of those kids. So it's, it's, it's more shocking to me

377
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:50.250
than it is to anyone else that I'm up here on this stage because no one would ever have figured that

378
00:55:50.260 --> 00:56:00.860
that would have been who I would become. Now, my grandmother prayed for that. My mom believed in

379
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:09.840
that, but I resisted that for as long as I could because I didn't want that. But it didn't change

380
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:20.239
the fact that what had been put in me and sew it into me. God was all along cultivating as were

381
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:30.719
these women that were in my life. So that one day I would turn from my darkness to the light and I

382
00:56:30.729 --> 00:56:38.610
need you to see that it can sometimes become overwhelming to do that kind of thing. And so we have

383
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:45.270
to still be able to cultivate talents and purpose. And so one of the key things about this passage

384
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:51.449
is that it says that we are to help a child in the way that it should go so that when they get old,

385
00:56:51.459 --> 00:56:58.250
they don't turn from it. And, and the idea here is not just speaking faith and scriptures and

386
00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:05.199
telling them about God and Jesus. But it's also about cultivating the very talents and the purpose

387
00:57:05.209 --> 00:57:12.070
of their life. And I remember that my mom and grandmother would often talk to me about my purpose

388
00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:17.419
and they would talk about it in a way that I didn't want, but it was something that they had

389
00:57:17.439 --> 00:57:24.860
received as a revelation from God for my life. And I always said, I don't feel that's fair. I feel

390
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:29.949
like I don't have a choice in this. I feel like what you've done is that you've predestined me in a

391
00:57:29.959 --> 00:57:36.889
way to, to an outcome that I'm very much not interested in. And often when we think about our

392
00:57:36.899 --> 00:57:43.320
talents and purpose, I feel like we can go sometimes our entire lives not understanding what any of

393
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:48.699
those are. Isn't that true? It wasn't long ago that I was communicating with someone who's now in a

394
00:57:48.709 --> 00:57:55.030
different part of the country. And we were talking about, um, assessments like spiritual assessments

395
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.689
and gifts assessments. Have you ever taken any spiritual assessments or done any kind of gifts

396
00:57:59.699 --> 00:58:05.000
assessments? Have you ever done any of those? And, and I would encourage you to do it because it,

397
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:11.010
it's kind of like holding up a mirror in a way that the person that looks back at you, you, uh, more

398
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:18.429
often than not will not want to agree with. Sometimes what is being seen in those assessment is not

399
00:58:18.439 --> 00:58:23.780
what you want to be. It's not what you want to hear. It's not necessarily what you envision your

400
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:30.379
life to be about, but it speaks profoundly about the way that you're answering and what it does is

401
00:58:30.389 --> 00:58:36.469
that in different stages of your life when you take these assessments, the answers do change because

402
00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:44.330
ultimately, there is a shifting that takes place in, in our life in the different stages of life.

403
00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:50.110
And, and I've often talked to people about spiritual assessments. The Bible talks about so many

404
00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:56.260
spiritual gifts and, and they're, and they're found in, in, in the 12th chapters of like Romans and,

405
00:58:56.270 --> 00:59:00.310
and, and first Corinthians and, and you can go through them and you can see that there are certain

406
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.669
things that when it's described there, you kind of look at it and you say, well, what does this mean

407
00:59:04.679 --> 00:59:11.879
for me? Well, one of the things that we have to do is to be able to identify a person's talent, a

408
00:59:11.889 --> 00:59:20.729
purpose and passion. I, I, as a father who loves sports, I put my kids in sports, I want them to be

409
00:59:20.739 --> 00:59:26.570
athletes and I wanted them, I imagine that they would love it as much as I did. I thought for sure

410
00:59:26.739 --> 00:59:33.479
they would also inherit, you know, some of my, uh, you know, just talent when it came to sports

411
00:59:33.489 --> 00:59:37.840
because when I was a kid, I was really good at different things and, and especially in sports and I

412
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:42.800
just thought that they would have that and I had a son, his name was Josiah and his name is still

413
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:50.060
Josiah. I don't know why I said it like that. And, and I brought him with me and I put him in soccer

414
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:55.040
and then, you know, I gave him golf lessons and I took him to tennis lessons and put him in, I tried,

415
00:59:55.050 --> 01:00:00.719
tried everything, you know, and, and he just didn't really take to any of those things. It just

416
01:00:00.729 --> 01:00:07.179
wasn't what his thing was. And I remember that he was like, you know, just geared towards technology

417
01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:13.939
and then I started to notice that he was really good at writing and, and I, and I stopped pushing,

418
01:00:13.949 --> 01:00:17.780
you know, in sports and I started pushing in writing and he would come to me and say, dad, I, I want

419
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:22.780
more time on the computer and I'd say it's, it's really good. But your mom and I, you know, we only

420
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:26.699
want to give you so much time and, and at the time, we had bought an Apple computer because at the

421
01:00:26.709 --> 01:00:32.290
time, the Apple computer could, would log you out, it would just log you out. And so the only thing

422
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:38.540
you log back in was was if the parent came along and then gave the kid more time. So five minutes,

423
01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:44.409
10 minutes, 30 minutes an hour, it was the best thing. And so he was always coming back. And so when

424
01:00:44.419 --> 01:00:49.290
he'd come back, I'd say, uh, and, and my wife would say, well, we want to cultivate your, your

425
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:57.070
talent in writing. So why don't you go and write a story and then come back, we'll read it and then

426
01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:05.459
we'll give you more time on the computer. And my son today is an excellent writer. He already was an

427
01:01:05.469 --> 01:01:10.860
excellent writer, but he is like an amazing writer and, and part of that is, is because he was

428
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:13.040
motivated by more computer time

429
01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:22.520
and not, not for writing. Does that make sense? So, and it's real, it's true. Right. He didn't care

430
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:29.040
about writing a short story. Um, he didn't want to do that. He wanted just more time on the computer

431
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:35.020
to do what he was interested in. And I want you to understand that today. It's, it's, it's amazing

432
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:44.570
to see how cultivating talent and, and purpose really has a key role in how we do things. And here's

433
01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:53.860
why because faith nurtures destiny. And I think that when we think about what it takes to have a

434
01:01:53.870 --> 01:02:01.239
person of faith in our household or to be a person of faith, I think that you need to understand

435
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:12.209
that your destiny goes beyond the ordinary because your God is extraordinary. Your destiny is also

436
01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:23.020
extraordinary because God does and creates only great things. Then your life purpose is to do great

437
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:32.610
things. But God wants you to understand this and for this to be cultivated in you. And some of us,

438
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:38.030
we just never got that kind of an encouragement or we got the kind of encouragement where no matter

439
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:45.479
how well we did, it just was never good enough. And sometimes we just found ourselves repeating

440
01:02:45.489 --> 01:02:56.300
those parents voice in our lives and also in the lives of our own Children. But God says, I want you

441
01:02:56.310 --> 01:03:04.810
to support their destiny through faith. And so start Children off on the way that they should go so

442
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:13.139
that they will not depart from it. And there in it lies this support throughout one's life. And I

443
01:03:13.149 --> 01:03:19.699
have to encourage people that if they haven't been this way when their Children were young and you

444
01:03:19.709 --> 01:03:27.669
know, better now, it is never too late for you to start. It is never too late for you to do this,

445
01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:33.570
for someone else to be this person that you wish you would have had in your own life. Does that make

446
01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:40.199
sense? It's like you didn't have that. But God is putting someone in your life where they can have

447
01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:46.719
that through you and it puts you in a position and an opportunity to be able to accomplish that in a

448
01:03:46.729 --> 01:03:53.530
way that you didn't see possible. Sometimes it isn't your kid. It's someone else's kid. But God

449
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:59.770
brings that kid into your life so you can do the very thing that you wish that had been done with

450
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:06.659
you. You can take this verse this powerful promise from God and implement that in someone else's

451
01:04:06.669 --> 01:04:11.379
life and it doesn't matter if you're married, it doesn't matter if you're single. It doesn't matter

452
01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:15.590
if that kid belongs to you and you just borrowed him from someone else's house. No, I'm just joking.

453
01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:22.310
You, you obviously can't do that. But you know what I mean? There's so many ways that we can support

454
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:29.310
and volunteer and being involved in other people's lives. It could be a cousin, it could be a nephew,

455
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:36.149
a niece. It could be someone that you get to cultivate that relationship with and encourage them on

456
01:04:36.159 --> 01:04:44.280
a spiritual journey that you yourself may not have had that same opportunity with. I want you to

457
01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:52.850
think about how mothers are also stewards of God's gifts and the responsibility that God speaks of.

458
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:59.520
This is found in Proverbs chapter one in verse eight and nine. And it says this, listen my son to

459
01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:05.280
your father's instruction. And then it says, and do not forsake your mother's teaching

460
01:05:07.459 --> 01:05:14.689
because they are a garland to grace your head and they were a chain to adorn your neck. Isn't that

461
01:05:14.699 --> 01:05:23.439
beautiful as the teaching that you've received when it speaks to you of your talent, when it speaks

462
01:05:23.449 --> 01:05:29.330
to you of your purpose, when it speaks to you of your destiny, when it speaks to you of faith, that

463
01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:37.969
God has made promises. And what this passage reminds us of is that mothers are stewards of God's

464
01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:45.600
gifts, that their responsibility is to uncover, but also to help develop that potential. It's not

465
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:52.989
just to speak to them of their destiny, but it's also to help them to develop their potential. And

466
01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.709
everything that we do is about giving the people in our life, the opportunity to shine, to grow, to

467
01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:07.510
become more and, and if people didn't do that in my life and they didn't do it in my wife's life,

468
01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:13.889
then, then we wouldn't have gotten to where we are today. We would never have been able to achieve

469
01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:20.409
what we achieved. And, and it was primarily because of faith, of people, of faith who invested in us

470
01:06:20.419 --> 01:06:28.270
and, and who took the time to help us to discern what it was that God had put in us in terms of

471
01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:35.080
potential. A lot of us today are thinking about. But what is my potential? I know that no one can

472
01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:43.080
discover their destiny and potential without understanding how that is tied in with our relationship

473
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:49.360
with the Father. You know, at different times of life, we, we, we understand things differently and

474
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:56.679
God creates opportunities for us in moments of life that we never would have imagined would be what

475
01:06:56.689 --> 01:07:02.399
we would be doing today. You know, sometimes you study something and you imagine this is gonna be

476
01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:09.570
your career and you study it and then you end up out in life and, and all of a sudden, it's, it's

477
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:17.179
not even that what you're doing because as much as that information and that knowledge and even that

478
01:07:17.189 --> 01:07:23.810
degree could have possibly just done something in terms of providing direction. It really didn't

479
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:31.209
speak to your purpose. You see, God has a way of going beyond all those things and, and redefining

480
01:07:31.219 --> 01:07:39.540
our purpose. And so sometimes we can put so much emphasis on education that we don't put enough

481
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:47.110
emphasis and understanding on potential and purpose. We think that the only way that a person is

482
01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.729
going to succeed is going to be because of the classroom and because of the degree and that's gonna

483
01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:59.000
open up opportunities and, and, and, and let's, let's be honest, there's a lot of educated people

484
01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:08.389
even in this country who just are lost and don't know what their talent potential and even purpose

485
01:08:08.399 --> 01:08:14.929
is, they're still trying to figure out their destiny. And, and I, I'll tell you that when you live

486
01:08:14.939 --> 01:08:20.930
your purpose and, and God helps bring people into your life to discover and uncover that purpose.

487
01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:30.180
Here's what happens even when things have not fallen in place just yet, you still feel like you are

488
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.689
empowered to go forward

489
01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:42.229
that even though things are not as you had wished them or planned them or prayed for them because

490
01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:49.778
God is with you, you know that your future is greater than anything that is in your past.

491
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.720
And we have to teach that and instill that because in the story that we're talking about the

492
01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:07.000
teaching that we sometimes don't have is that guidance towards divine purpose. And I want you to

493
01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:15.129
imagine that, that we may spend a lot of time emphasizing a lot of things. But if we're not spending

494
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:25.430
more time emphasizing the divine and emphasizing our destiny as seen and understood through the

495
01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:34.540
power and the presence of God, then whoever we are in this room at whatever age and whatever role we

496
01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:43.279
may have, we will never achieve the fullness of God's purpose because we are not doing this very

497
01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:52.139
thing. God is saying, do you want to live your life with divine purpose? Well, then here's what I

498
01:09:52.148 --> 01:09:59.720
want to encourage you to do. I want you to spend time talking about God. You know, we, we have a

499
01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:06.939
kids program here and we've taken incredible steps and strides and we're gonna be adding worship as

500
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:13.109
you heard. Um Today, I'm so proud of that and so proud of our team. Isn't that exciting for our

501
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.040
church and for our kids ministry.

502
01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:26.790
But, but here's what I know if I don't spend the majority of my day talking to my kids about God.

503
01:10:28.459 --> 01:10:33.149
The two hours on a Sunday is not what's going to give them the experience of God.

504
01:10:35.359 --> 01:10:40.180
We may not have the best program of any church in the city.

505
01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:47.720
But if I am not the best parent in teaching my kids about God, my kids are not going to know Jesus.

506
01:10:47.729 --> 01:10:56.339
Does that make sense? My son is 25. My daughter is 19 and they still come to church with me every

507
01:10:56.350 --> 01:11:02.700
single week. I never have to ask them to come. I never have to make it an issue or it's never a

508
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:07.529
problem in our household. It's not something that we ever have to discuss. They just want to do it.

509
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.729
They want to be here, they want to serve, they want to help. They want to be a part of this because

510
01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:16.560
they love God. And the reason they love God is because their parents love God. And they taught them

511
01:11:16.569 --> 01:11:21.810
about God and they spoke to them about God no matter what the situations and the circumstances were.

512
01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:27.509
And they were real about God, even when they were struggling, even when they weren't good at being a

513
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.319
father or a mother or as parents, even when they had their doubts and even when we didn't always

514
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:38.319
make good choices and even when we had to have deep discussions about Brokenness in our own lives in

515
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:44.509
our own household. Does that make sense? Not hiding any of those things? Or even when people were

516
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:51.129
not nice to us as, as pastors or they weren't good to us and, and at times when we weren't good as

517
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:57.520
pastors towards people and we could have done better. Does that make sense? See when you don't hide

518
01:11:57.529 --> 01:12:02.709
those things and you talk about those things and, and, and you talk about purpose and destiny and

519
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.680
you talk about potential and talent and you talk about how God has put us on this earth to

520
01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:12.160
accomplish great things. Here's what's gonna happen. God is always going to be real. You're not

521
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:18.290
gonna have to convince your Children that God is real. They're gonna see it every day and I want you

522
01:12:18.299 --> 01:12:23.850
to be able to do the same thing. Just be real about your relationship with God. Be real. How you

523
01:12:23.859 --> 01:12:30.120
didn't have the mother you wanted to have, be real about how you didn't have the kind of life that

524
01:12:30.129 --> 01:12:37.080
you wish you had. It's ok, it's ok even now it's ok if it's not going as planned. But here's what

525
01:12:37.089 --> 01:12:45.040
God is trying to remind you of that. You are still a steward of God's gifts and that you are still

526
01:12:45.049 --> 01:12:50.939
put in a position where you can uncover and develop potential and also guide towards divine purpose.

527
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:56.080
And I know that's so important for us to be well surrounded. And that's why I want to speak to you

528
01:12:56.089 --> 01:13:05.160
about this last point. And it's found in Ezekiel 19 in Ezekiel 19 and verse 10 and 11, it says your

529
01:13:05.169 --> 01:13:11.359
mother was like a vine in your vineyard and it says that she was planted by the water and it was

530
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:20.290
fruitful and it was full of branches because of abundant water and its branches were strong and it

531
01:13:20.299 --> 01:13:28.129
was fit for a ruler's sector and it towered high above the thick foliage and it was conspicuous for

532
01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:36.479
its height and it's for its many branches. And what this passage of scripture speaks to us about is

533
01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:42.419
how when we are well surrounded, when we are well supported, when we are well planted, when we have

534
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:51.399
a steady supply of water that we are going to be able to do amazing things. And in the same way that

535
01:13:51.410 --> 01:14:00.899
we need this, we can see that how God has placed mothers in the household so they can be celebrated

536
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:09.129
and supported. Can we say amen to that? We need that? We need to do that and we need to be the ones

537
01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:16.500
who are for that, that we need to acknowledge their efforts in, in all that they do in in nurturing

538
01:14:16.509 --> 01:14:22.959
those talents and, and talking about destiny and potential and, and showing them how life is going

539
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:28.339
to be hard. But you can get back up because God is someone who is still faithful and he's going to

540
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:34.500
fulfill His promises that your purpose is not done, that he has something great still in store for

541
01:14:34.509 --> 01:14:41.120
your life, that it doesn't matter at what age you find yourself in, that you can still accomplish

542
01:14:41.129 --> 01:14:47.830
amazing things for the Lord. This is what God is reminding us of. And today it's, it's more

543
01:14:47.839 --> 01:14:53.959
important than ever to be reminded of it as we celebrate mothers and motherhood because we see the

544
01:14:53.970 --> 01:15:00.319
importance that they have in encouraging Children in shaping their future. And I know that we are

545
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:07.640
people that are about the future. We are very much about God just helping us to deal with the past

546
01:15:07.649 --> 01:15:13.459
and the present. But we are also people who are helping create the future. And I know that as we

547
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:20.020
invest as a community of faith in the Children of this church that as we serve with children's

548
01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:27.290
ministries or we serve with youth ministry that as we make programming and activities available to

549
01:15:27.299 --> 01:15:33.479
people that that would never step foot in a church and never get to discover any of these things

550
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:39.819
that we are talking about. We can all do that. You see the motherhood of God through these

551
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:47.799
ministries and programs can be seen and evidenced and we too can be those who help others have

552
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:54.470
access to the very things that will help them flourish and fulfill their divine purpose and destiny.

553
01:15:55.209 --> 01:16:03.450
As we create this environment, as we create this space, we can be the the mothers to this community

554
01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:10.390
in a way that they may never experience anywhere else. And God is saying you can do this in your

555
01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:16.819
home, you can do this in your household. You can be this for your Children, but we can also be this

556
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:24.689
for whoever needs it. And these principles aren't just for mothers, they're just for us. But today,

557
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:30.879
as we celebrate mothers and we see how they need to be supported. We need to come alongside women

558
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:38.770
and help them to fulfill their destiny, to reach their purpose and to do the very things that God

559
01:16:38.779 --> 01:16:47.080
has put on their hearts to do. That's why we focused on our girls women's ministry. Today. We, we

560
01:16:47.089 --> 01:16:53.120
believe in this so powerfully and so strongly, we know that this is gonna make a huge difference in

561
01:16:53.129 --> 01:16:58.100
our community and in our surrounding community, I know it's gonna impact not just the people in this

562
01:16:58.109 --> 01:17:04.009
church, but it's gonna impact our entire city. Can you see that with me? Can you believe in that

563
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:10.589
with me? You see when we take the very things that we wish we had and don't have but can find a way

564
01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:17.229
to give back and to serve and to still make possible, we can still fulfill a purpose and a destiny.

565
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:24.109
We can still use our talents and our giftings in a way that is just different than the way that we

566
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:32.189
maybe have envisioned them. I look at how Patricia today talked about her foundation and how she has

567
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:39.029
all these Children that she's a mother too. And that's a way that you can still make a difference in

568
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:45.120
the world. It may not be the way that God calls you to make a difference in the world. But isn't it

569
01:17:45.129 --> 01:17:52.390
amazing that that's possible? And that motherhood gets redefined in a way that we never thought

570
01:17:52.399 --> 01:17:59.959
possible? See, that's what we get stuck with. We get stuck with the definitions of what we think.

571
01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:06.459
Motherhood is what we think being a mother is like. And we don't give God the opportunity to shine

572
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:13.930
those attributes in new found ways in new situations and circumstances that we had never possibly

573
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:22.919
envisioned or imagined. But there they are in front of us and God is still calling on us to be like

574
01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:34.029
that vine in the vineyard that is planted by the water, bringing fruit full of branches because of

575
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:40.080
the abundant water. And I pray that you would come alongside those that are doing that kind of thing

576
01:18:40.089 --> 01:18:46.740
as well that you would see the person who is in need, the person that is struggling, the person who

577
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:52.509
needs that encouragement because they're not getting it from anywhere else. But when God puts us in

578
01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:59.930
community, it's so that we can see what the needs of one another are and say this person needs a

579
01:18:59.939 --> 01:19:01.589
mother. I'm gonna be a mother to them.

580
01:19:04.459 --> 01:19:10.500
I'm gonna be in their life. I'm gonna speak to them in the way that they need it. I'm gonna be their

581
01:19:10.509 --> 01:19:16.830
encouragement. I'm gonna remind them of their talent. I'm gonna speak to them about their purpose.

582
01:19:17.069 --> 01:19:26.959
I'm gonna once again, push them towards their destiny. And so God is putting us in a position to not

583
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:35.140
just do this in our households, but he's showing us how it can be possible even in community, in a

584
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:39.839
community of faith just like this. And I just want to say, thank you for being a part of it. Thank

585
01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:45.500
you for stepping out and volunteering and having an open mind and open heart and seeing how God is,

586
01:19:45.509 --> 01:19:51.410
is calling on you to, to maybe make a difference in someone's life and for our God is, is ready to

587
01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:56.890
make a difference also in yours and the healing that you need in the area that you need it. Most

588
01:19:56.919 --> 01:20:04.729
some of us need healing in our lives today. Some of us need our wombs to be open so that we can have

589
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:12.140
Children. Some of us need a relationship so that we can enter into motherhood. Other others of us,

590
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:18.520
we hear what is being said and, and being explained and described and God needs to redefine that for

591
01:20:18.529 --> 01:20:24.859
us in a new way. He needs to speak to us about what this means in our life practically like what is

592
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:29.100
it that God, you want me to be? What is it you want me to do? How do you want me to put this into

593
01:20:29.109 --> 01:20:34.950
practice? Because this is your word and it speaking to me about what I have to do in the next steps

594
01:20:34.959 --> 01:20:40.029
that I have to take. And I need you to see that these principles, they're applicable, whether they

595
01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:45.770
be male or female, whether it be mothers or not. They're principles that when God speaks them, he

596
01:20:45.779 --> 01:20:52.220
speaks them even to mothers because in a time in which mothers were always relegated to an inferior

597
01:20:52.229 --> 01:21:01.169
position in the household, an inferior position in the church, an inferior position in society. God

598
01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:09.640
was making it clear, this is not my plan, this is not my heart, this is not what I want. I want

599
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:15.779
women and I want mothers, I want them to shine. They have a great purpose and we serve a God who

600
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:26.580
loves, loves you and wants to help you fulfill your destiny, your purpose, use your talents and your

601
01:21:26.589 --> 01:21:32.660
giftings and make your calling clear in this life so that you can make a difference. God bless you

602
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:33.750
guys. Thank you so much.

603
01:21:40.879 --> 01:21:46.799
The band's just gonna come back up and, and just play something for us at the end and, and it's

604
01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:52.660
gonna give us an opportunity um to hand out the gifts at the end as well. And so wait for a day as

605
01:21:52.669 --> 01:22:01.500
she comes for that. And uh we have uh some mother's day uh cake and, and treats there uh for you.

606
01:22:01.589 --> 01:22:07.410
It's gonna be a great opportunity for us to just hang out at the end and just talk. And so I'm

607
01:22:07.419 --> 01:22:14.120
excited for today and for you and for the blessings that God has in store for you. And so let's just

608
01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:21.250
pray that God can just make His word, just come alive for each of us today. And father, I thank you

609
01:22:21.259 --> 01:22:28.640
for each person and for the way that you have brought them into community with us today and, and for

610
01:22:28.649 --> 01:22:37.299
the way that you have blessed them in the role and in the motherhood that you have given them. I

611
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:43.259
wanna pray for the moms today and we wanna pray your blessing upon them and the principles that they

612
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:48.209
have heard today and the things that they could do better and differently and, and things that they

613
01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:54.160
can commit to and implementing in their own lives and in their own household with their own Children,

614
01:22:54.390 --> 01:23:04.910
no matter what age they have, no matter if they're still close or far, whether there's a family that

615
01:23:04.919 --> 01:23:11.049
still is held together by love or maybe it's just torn apart

616
01:23:13.069 --> 01:23:22.250
just by Brokenness and by mistakes that have been made. Lord, I pray that whatever the healing is

617
01:23:22.259 --> 01:23:30.509
and whatever the steps that need to be taken to experience restoration, that every person here would

618
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:37.459
have that in a new and powerful way. Lord, you know their, their thoughts, you know their, their

619
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:43.439
hearts, you know what every woman here is, is thinking about and

620
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:54.470
having faith for but also maybe struggling with, I pray that you would speak to them today in a deep

621
01:23:54.479 --> 01:24:02.350
and profound way that you would help them to, to heal and to recover. And but more importantly to,

622
01:24:02.479 --> 01:24:09.160
to see the purpose and the great destiny that they have to use the talents and the gifts that you've

623
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:18.259
given them to do incredible things. And today we, we honor them, we bless them, we pray for them and

624
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:28.180
we uphold and support them. So we know that they are truly world changers and we ask these things in

625
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:34.879
Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank you guys. Can we just welcome the team?

626
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:37.419
OK.

627
01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:49.620
As they sing this song, did you guys stand and respond to this song? Make this your prayer to God.

628
01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:57.379
We look to God for our strength, our source, our provision to protect us. Look to him for wisdom.

655
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:14.479
thank you so much worship team. Can we give it up for the worship team one more time? Gentlemen,

656
01:31:19.779 --> 01:31:26.160
so we hope that you were encouraged today. You heard a good word today? I don't know about you, but

657
01:31:26.169 --> 01:31:33.100
I might watch that one again. And I think yeah, it was awesome today. So um I think that's a

658
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:38.740
