We've made it to March. Can you believe it? Apparently. I'm told that the clocks go forward next

2
00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:28.109
week. Who's ready for that? Not yet. I'm a skier. So it's bittersweet. I love a tan, but at the same

3
00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:33.779
time, I'm hoping snow stays a little bit longer. Um So we welcome everybody that's in the house

4
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:40.079
today. Everybody that's online. Thank you for joining us today. We are starting a new two part

5
00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:47.829
series with our beloved Johan this morning called Living with the End in mind. So we hope you tune

6
00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:54.200
in for part two next week. Um We want to remind you that river's edge is a place where you belong

7
00:07:54.209 --> 00:08:00.750
before you believe. We really want to encourage you that we want people to live an authentic life of

8
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:07.160
love and faith and hope. And it's a community where really you can just show up as you are. God

9
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:13.549
loves you that way. We wanna love you that way. So join us. So let's prepare our hearts. Let's stand

10
00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:18.279
up. Let's get ready to worship with our worship team. Let's do it

11
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:33.340
It's a miracle. It's good to be together in the house of the Lord. Um Yeah, just encourage week to

12
00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:40.130
week people showing up. Um We're a, we're a smaller little band this morning, but uh the Lord

13
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.140
provides, I see, see a big, beautiful bunch of angels, a nice little choir that we can uh that we

14
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.520
can use together. So our hope is that, you know, you guys can feel invited and, and you wanna

15
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:58.070
participate in, in singing these songs. Um Yeah, so I kind of wanted to, I guess because we're,

16
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.590
we're, we're kind of stripped down. Um We're, we're gonna keep things simple and uh yeah, I think

17
00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:07.440
any anybody could use more simple in their lives. a little bit.

18
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:18.210
Amen. Amen. And um when I, when I think of God and uh and, and at least being in true relationship

19
00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:24.989
with him. Um I think of just just how, how, how, how easy, not, not necessarily the Christian walk

20
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.179
is easy, but his invitation to come to him is, is so simple. And there's a verse that ties that all

21
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:36.210
together and you might know what it's called John. It's, it's John 3 16. We're gonna have it up on

22
00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:43.179
there if you guys want to read it out loud with me for this is how God loved the world. He gave his

23
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:49.909
one and only son. so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. That's

24
00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:55.650
the gospel. That's the good news. It's that easy. We have that in Jesus. We have that in our church

25
00:09:55.659 --> 00:10:01.500
and in fellowship. And so, uh yeah, I just wanna invite you guys um to sing these songs with us to

26
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:07.599
sing about how, how good and amazing our God is. And so father, we just, there will be no other God

27
00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:14.049
before you this morning, Lord rain in this place in our hearts, uh speak to us. Lord lead us, guide

28
00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:19.590

29
00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:23.780
great your grace is and how beautiful your name is. Lord. We just want to be close to you today.

So if you are at all interested in helping Talita out, please, there's a sign up sheet at the back.

167
00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:37.604
She'll be at the back after the service. And if you've never thought about working with kids, maybe

168
00:30:37.614 --> 00:30:43.425
this is your opportunity to give it a go and see how, uh how you find it anyway, needs a little bit

169
00:30:43.435 --> 00:30:50.849
of help. So let's rally together and see if we can do that for her. Um And finally, there are four

170
00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:58.420
ways to give. So it takes some finances to make our community run and for us to do outreach outside

171
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:04.339
of these walls, which is particularly important to us. And so we just ask and encourage that if

172
00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:11.130
whatever God puts on your heart. Um If you wanna donate that, it does go to the needs of this

173
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:18.069
community. And outside there are programs in place and uh we need everybody's contribution for, for

174
00:31:18.079 --> 00:31:22.780
a little bit of help. So there are four ways to make it as convenient for you as possible. So let's

175
00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:29.250
prepare our hearts. Now. Um Joan will be coming out to uh to speak with us and encourage us today.

176
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.280
Have a great service,

177
00:32:51.829 --> 00:32:58.670
Hey, good morning, River Sedge. Hey, wow, you're really already warmed up. You don't want to do

178
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.859
exercise this morning and that's the reason why you're answering me that way. So I really appreciate

179
00:33:03.869 --> 00:33:09.750
that. So, for those of you who aren't aware. Sometimes I made some exercise, uh asking people to do

180
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:16.239
some flexibility, exercise, yoga, stretching just to make sure that we are warm and prepare for the

181
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:26.319
gathering. But uh today's uh today, in fact, uh Lorenzo is in vacation with his family. So Michelle

182
00:33:26.329 --> 00:33:34.489
and Josiah and Kaya are away for the next two weeks. So right now, we're opening thing, all of that

183
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:41.770
wonderful service without their help, but with their legacy and they're probably looking at us right

184
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:49.260
now. So I won't do too much folly, are a fool of myself. I'm as I'm usually doing, but seriously,

185
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:55.530
we've been extremely privileged to have them. If it wasn't from them in the pandemic, they really

186
00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:01.250
were holding that church and that service all together as a family, there was a couple of people

187
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:09.139
that volunteer. Uh, but if it wasn't from their core family, we wouldn't have a gathering today. In

188
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:16.370
fact, I think, I think I'm sure that it's the first gathering physical in prisons where the four of

189
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:24.850
them are awake. So, so it's a well deserved rest and I think we can really acknowledge them by doing

190
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.610
a short applause this morning.

191
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:36.370
So it's my privilege to be with you this morning. I don't know if it will be your privilege or not.

192
00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:44.540
You'll see after and you can come and comment as always as you know, I'm always receiving ample

193
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:51.439
comments about the announcement that I'm doing. And uh today is finally the Sunday where we're going

194
00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:56.550
to do only announcements. So for the next 30 minutes, it will be announcement after announcement is

195
00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.979
going to be awesome. uh be so excited, but just before we start uh as a touch of humor, I was going

196
00:35:03.989 --> 00:35:11.040
when I left after the worship. I just was going to for a short healthy pause and I thought after

197
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:17.540
that my mic was open but I know it was muted there. So I thought that, oh my gosh, that would be

198
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:23.919
some kind of, or inconvenient. But the good thing you would have heard is that I washed my hand

199
00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:32.340
after. So I just wanted you to know that, ok, But anyway, so coming back to the most serious thing,

200
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:39.780
uh, this morning, what I wanted to share with you, uh, it's a kind of a micro theory, uh, about, uh,

201
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:47.429
doing life with the end in mind. and that's the micro series because I'll be with you. Uh God

202
00:35:47.439 --> 00:35:53.620
willing next Sunday as well for the, the, the next part of that series that we're gonna start today

203
00:35:53.629 --> 00:36:01.500
together. So, and where that does that name come from? Uh Essentially it was a uh a reading that

204
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:09.050
I've done recently uh about uh psychiatrist. So why do I'm reading that kind of stuff? Uh It says a

205
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:17.699
lot on, my life and what is happening between my two years. But um seriously about that psychiatrist

206
00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:27.399
named uh Elizabeth Kubler Ross, uh who did uh research and studies on uh dying and people near death.

207
00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:35.425
Uh So she did that basically. like in the mid fifties and a little bit later as well and we owe to

208
00:36:35.435 --> 00:36:42.145
that women, uh, the five stages of grief that you probably already heard about. The, the denial, the

209
00:36:42.155 --> 00:36:52.540
anger, the, um, the, uh, Patricia. Yeah. Exact, bargaining, exact Depression? Exactly. And thank you,

210
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:58.050
uh Judy and Patricia and everyone that know that way better than I. So we owe that to that women,

211
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:06.100
that women, these concepts and these phases. So she really studied that carefully. And one of the

212
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:14.409
other things that she found having done many interview with people dying at their, at the end of

213
00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:24.330
their days It's that people were, were seeing or were thinking about A relationship most people and

214
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:32.219
not necessarily and don't wanna be uh do doing gene uh general general generality. Anyway,

215
00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:39.209
generalization So thank you, everyone. So yeah, it's an interactive message just pausing right now.

216
00:37:39.219 --> 00:37:45.520
So yes, you can fill the blanks and that's really on purpose. Just first take, making sure you're

217
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:56.840
still awake and following as well. And uh thirdly helping me also. OK. So uh so yes, so don't want

218
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:04.300
to generalize, but still what she said was mostly people. when they were about to die. They were

219
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:12.550
thinking mostly about two things first, a right relationship with God. and second a right

220
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.979
relationship with the one they love. And this is what you have at the next sentence. If you are more

221
00:38:18.989 --> 00:38:26.669
kind of a visual, not a sentence, but at, at the next slide. So that's really what she found. People

222
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:34.090
are thinking at the end of their life about a right relationship with God and a right relationship

223
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:41.540
with people they love. And that was mostly what I've read about that woman. Uh I, I because that

224
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:48.560
wasn't the topic of the book that I was reading, but it still captured my mind about one thing

225
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:58.040
because what I was thinking about is if we are kind of most people, we probably will ask this

226
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:04.340
question at the end of our days. So I guess we are probably kind of most people here. We're a pretty

227
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:10.899
good varied group. So we probably will have to fight with those thoughts at some point in our life.

228
00:39:10.909 --> 00:39:17.020
And I hope the later will be the better for all of us. But I, I was also thinking that it would be a

229
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:27.889
good thing to figure this question some answer a little bit sooner than later because, you know,

230
00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:35.520
when we're dealing with the project, our life project It's a good thing I think to be more careful

231
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:46.000
than less. Uh, and just giving you a quick example. I, I, um, 4434 years ago, four years. I, oh, I

232
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:53.389
forgot to start my timer. My gosh. I'm sorry, guys How would you say I'm talking for how long right

233
00:39:53.399 --> 00:39:59.050
now? I know someone will say it's an hour long. I want to quit. So it's OK. But except for those,

234
00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:06.689
those who have a more accurate uh 10 minutes. OK. Perfect. 10 minutes. Spark. So I'm already late.

235
00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:09.010
So forgot about that story

236
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.649
yeah. Do you want to hear the story about my pool or not?

237
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:28.260
yes, you want that story. So don't blame me if it's a 35 minutes message length. OK. So just because

238
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:33.610
you choose it, it's kind of interactive. So you decide the length of the message as well. So talking

239
00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:41.010
about my pool project, uh it was a Out Ground Pool project and usually we meticulously calculate and

240
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:46.919
my wife is there with me and we were both in that wonderful project together out ground pool that we

241
00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:53.669
will do ourselves. But uh use out ground pool that we wanted to strip from the old paint and paint

242
00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:59.879
it back and uh yeah, I'm seeing some faces and he's completely full. Yes, absolutely. Uh Doesn't

243
00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:09.060
make any sense. And we figured this out. going through the project. OK. So fly, after fly decided to

244
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:16.050
buy a new piece, buy this, this new piece by the old pool, buy a brand new pool and say so again and

245
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:24.560
again and again. So really the name of that project was after a word. Apocalypse. It gives you an

246
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:34.399
example of how bad it went. OK. But, but that's, that's one project in our life. And then we learn

247
00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:42.219
from these mistakes or, and, and we try to correct the trajectory, but that's one thing to miss a

248
00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:51.159
project in our life. That's another to miss to Miss the project of our life. OK. And this is the

249
00:41:51.169 --> 00:41:58.659
reason why and I've written that quote there. It's just coming from me. I thought it would work

250
00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:05.639
something eventually on the internet, Instagram post something I'll try to remember that. But so

251
00:42:05.649 --> 00:42:12.530
that's the idea about that message today is that we don't want to miss the project of our life. We

252
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:19.139
want to make sure to have some kind of success and not missing the mark. So if we're gonna ask

253
00:42:19.149 --> 00:42:27.979
ourselves the question about a relationship, a right relationship with God, what does it look like

254
00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:34.899
and how, what can we do to maintain it? And that's the question that I wanted to ask ourselves this

255
00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:42.500
morning So If we're looking and skimming through the scriptures about some verse, to understand a

256
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:48.580
little bit more about a right relationship with God, we will encounter some verse that describe us.

257
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:56.979
Well, what it is not a good relationship with God and on purpose, I will give you some verse that.

258
00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:03.010
And without reading the old chapter, because you will have already the answer. And the idea is

259
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:10.139
really to keep you until the end. So on purpose, I've chosen some verse that are really more

260
00:43:10.149 --> 00:43:16.209
puzzling than a censor. But again, it's on purpose and I don't want to misuse the scripture. It's

261
00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:22.580
just because I want to uh lengthen a little bit the, the challenge and be having you an appetite for

262
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:27.649
the rest of the message. So one of the first passage that I wanted to cover with you is a passage

263
00:43:27.659 --> 00:43:30.649
that we discover in Asia.

264
00:43:36.639 --> 00:43:36.820
Isaiah,

265
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.110
Isaiah. OK, perfect. Thank you. You understand what I'm talking about? let's call him Bob for the

266
00:43:47.120 --> 00:44:01.370
purpose of this message. OK. So the prophet Bob also known as um was used by God to give some words.

267
00:44:01.379 --> 00:44:09.290
And, and it started really harsh in that first passage and, and remember that prophet was talking to

268
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:18.199
the people, the chosen people of God. So Israel is playing a key part in the history and the is the

269
00:44:18.209 --> 00:44:27.129
story of humanity. God has chosen that those people to be able to accomplish his rescue plan for

270
00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:33.409
humanity. OK. So, so he had something in mind for these people because he had a plan and eventually

271
00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:39.659
that plan is just unfolding with the person of Jesus. But then it takes a long time to accomplish

272
00:44:39.669 --> 00:44:48.010
that plan. So Bob wasn't it? We're talking about 3000 years ago when Bob was used by, by God to talk

273
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:56.120
to the Jewish people. And what he said was this. So God is talking, what makes you think? Oh, I want

274
00:44:56.129 --> 00:45:04.010
all your sacrifices. Say the Lord, I am sick of your burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened

275
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:13.379
cattle. I get no pleasure from the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. And this uh is obviously

276
00:45:13.389 --> 00:45:21.850
referring to some of the law's requirement at that time. That's where what was asked is to offer

277
00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:30.530
some of these sacrifices for the sin or for any other uh situation. So there was kind of observance

278
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:37.810
regarding that. What what God is saying is that I am sick of that. He's just tired of this. You find

279
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:45.370
no pleasure in that. So if we do the parallel with what we're maybe seeing today in our life,

280
00:45:45.379 --> 00:45:54.129
switching in my head about the two languages, always fun but uh adapt. But so what, what are the

281
00:45:54.139 --> 00:46:01.020
parallel that we can do with our life today about these kind of sacrifices is that it's any maybe

282
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:07.310
spiritual act that we can see in our life, maybe that will be prayer, maybe that will be uh

283
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:14.405
attending to church, maybe that will be other task. And the parallel is really not really good. But

284
00:46:14.415 --> 00:46:21.725
the thing is that we could consider these acts as some kind of sacrifices that we do to God or

285
00:46:21.735 --> 00:46:28.985
strict up servants of do if there is an because obviously, there is do with when we're following the

286
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:38.879
example of Jesus. But I'm just trying to do parallel here. So Apparently this is not what is a good

287
00:46:38.889 --> 00:46:45.429
relationship, a right relationship with God. So let's move forward 1000 year after in the time of

288
00:46:45.439 --> 00:46:54.969
Christ. Uh So Jesus himself when he was engaging also with the pharisee uh in uh when he was here on

289
00:46:54.979 --> 00:47:02.550
earth uh in his physical form, He had an encounter with them and he had really some kind of harsh

290
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:09.800
comment to uh the Pharisees and the responsible doctor of the law and what he mentioned to them in

291
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:17.239
Matthew 23, that's the, the, the verse that is there at the screen. is that again, really harsh,

292
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:24.540
what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees hypocrites for you are careful to

293
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:31.070
tide even the tiniest income from your herb garden. But you ignore the more important aspect of the

294
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:42.459
law, justice, mercy and faith. You should. Yes, but do not neglect the more important things. hm So

295
00:47:43.699 --> 00:47:50.159
in that verse, what Jesus is saying is again, like these tricks of servants of the law, there's the

296
00:47:50.169 --> 00:47:59.100
the commandments that they receive in the law and, and, and taking a super attention to that at the

297
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:08.479
end is saying, you should see it's a good thing. OK? And again, bear with me, we're talking about

298
00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:15.169
Old Testament here and not necessarily the New Testament. And like when Jesus died, all that law

299
00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:22.610
principle and all these elements just fades away. OK? But the thing is saying yeah, law is good. But

300
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:29.330
again, you should not neglect more important things. So it's ease pointing us to something bigger

301
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:37.000
than following strict observance of the law. And another another passage, Jesus again, And, and that

302
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:43.959
one is a really interesting one uh that I found for many, many years and still to this day when

303
00:48:43.969 --> 00:48:50.080
Jesus ends up his message on the mountains, uh the sermon on the mountain, he, he, he, he said to

304
00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:56.379
the the the the crowd that was there saying at the end of the day and this is what you find in

305
00:48:56.389 --> 00:49:02.800
Matthew seven in the next slide. Uh Matthew seven, he said on judgment day, many will say to me,

306
00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:08.669
Lord Lord, we prophesized in your name and cast out demons in your name and perform many miracles in

307
00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:16.580
your name. But I will reply. I never knew you get away from me you who breaks God's luck. and that's

308
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:23.110
really interesting because on the other verse, we say God, Jesus was saying, you should not ignore

309
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:29.699
mercy and uh and justice, these are also extremely important aspect. And I would have think that

310
00:49:29.709 --> 00:49:41.399
doing such miracles, such incredible acts of spiritual acts would be enabling God a right

311
00:49:41.409 --> 00:49:47.320
relationship or not necessarily enabling, but describing a right relationship with God. But

312
00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:53.639
obviously, in this case, there's something lacking again because Jesus is saying, I never knew you.

313
00:49:53.649 --> 00:50:00.679
There's a component where Jesus wants us to know Him. and it's on, not only yes, it's worth a name

314
00:50:00.689 --> 00:50:06.159
and I think, yes, not because of what I've said, but because of what you said. But, but that's

315
00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:11.919
really the, the principle. There's really some kind of a clue here. So if we unfold that and fast

316
00:50:11.929 --> 00:50:22.899
forward that to that, what is really, a a good way to encapsulate what is a right relationship with

317
00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:29.010
God. And again, it's right relationship with God that we're talking here. And because, and, and just

318
00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:37.300
as a little side note about that Having a relationship with God is something. And from that

319
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:45.030
relationship came a lot of wonderful things and, and this, having a relationship with God is as

320
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:53.600
simple as saying God, I give you the control of my life. I surrender. I've tried many ways alone

321
00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:59.949
trying to figure things out on my way. But I need your help. The minute you decide that the minute

322
00:50:59.959 --> 00:51:05.419
you enter in the relationship with God and that's it. And that's all. That's no, there's no more,

323
00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:13.860
there's no complexity and this is opening you uh a new realm of possibility. It's as simple as that.

324
00:51:14.439 --> 00:51:20.989
but then if you want to deepen that new relationship that you've just started, this is what we're

325
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:28.169
talking about this morning. So a right relationship with God is described again by Jesus himself.

326
00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:33.879
When some again Pharisees and doctor of the law because they were puzzled with that Jesus guy. He

327
00:51:33.889 --> 00:51:42.530
was just mixing everyone. because they figured out what was religion about. It was so simple before

328
00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:53.729
Jesus. Ok? Because they were just having to follow strict law, spiritual activities were entangled

329
00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:59.310
or attached to do this. Do not that do this, do this and that and don't and this, they were

330
00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:05.929
specialists and that doctor of the law. Imagine. So it was super complex and they were building

331
00:52:05.939 --> 00:52:13.169
their life around that as well. Ok? So it was a wonderful, a wonderful world. But when Jesus came,

332
00:52:13.179 --> 00:52:21.580
it just dismiss all of that and see these harsh words about you miss the bold guys. What I miss the

333
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:29.459
bold man. I have 101,000 per following of this. Are you not man? We have, what could I have missed?

334
00:52:29.469 --> 00:52:33.489
What could we have missed whatever you understood me? But

335
00:52:39.129 --> 00:52:48.949
So anyway, so you got the point So it was so easy before Jesus came. OK? And now he's complex,

336
00:52:48.959 --> 00:52:56.860
fighting to their eyes, everything with that statement because the pharisee want to, to, to really

337
00:52:57.399 --> 00:53:04.330
narrow it down and, and to trap Jesus in like saying, you, you're gonna say Jesus that something in

338
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:09.439
the light is not good. OK? And the minute he's gonna say that there will be other reason. They, they,

339
00:53:09.449 --> 00:53:15.689
they found another reason, but that one was their plan. A to be able to get rid of Jesus. He said,

340
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:28.340
let's make it as we Uh come on, if we let's make him admit exactly that the law is not good in any

341
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:33.149
way. So they ask him that question. So again, next, first that we have,

342
00:53:35.959 --> 00:53:41.919
again an expert in religious law because you needed to be an expert. OK. That's, that's, that's the

343
00:53:41.929 --> 00:53:48.310
extent of what was required. So imagine having a right relationship with God require to be an expert

344
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:55.989
in the law. That's kind of an understanding in a, just up to a certain extent. So try to trap him,

345
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.290
as I mentioned, teacher, which is the most important commandment in the love of Moses. Jesus replied,

346
00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:11.939
you must love the Lord, your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind. This is

347
00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:19.919
the first and greatest commandment, and then he adds a 2nd 2nd is equally important. Love your

348
00:54:19.929 --> 00:54:27.850
neighbor, neighbor as yourself, the entire law and the demands of all the prophets are based on

349
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:37.169
these two commandments. So completely revisiting their understanding and bringing that back to is

350
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:45.709
simplicity and the original intent of God for humanity. and that the original intent of God for

351
00:54:45.719 --> 00:54:53.510
humanity. And if we want to grasp this morning and not a arriving at the end of our day saying, do I

352
00:54:53.520 --> 00:55:01.399
have a right relationship with God? We have the two principles illustrated here. The first one is

353
00:55:01.409 --> 00:55:11.300
love, God, love God. The, the, the first principle, if we want to have a right relationship with God

354
00:55:11.959 --> 00:55:20.540
is to answer the question. Are we crazy in love with them? Think about a couple relationship. It's

355
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:29.840
to that extent that you need to be able to evaluate your relationship with God. On one aspect, you

356
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:37.649
have a loving relationship that you nurture. If you want to have a right relationship with God, this

357
00:55:37.659 --> 00:55:46.340
needs to be construct around a simple thing. Just a loving relationship that we nurture with Him

358
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:52.350
with all the behavior that comes with that kind of relationship, the kind of relationship that we

359
00:55:52.360 --> 00:56:00.189
have with our Children, our loved one. But Jesus or God is being our loved one when we choose to

360
00:56:00.199 --> 00:56:07.399
have that relationship with him. And so we need, when we want to evaluate a right relationship with

361
00:56:07.409 --> 00:56:15.219
God, we need to evaluate our passion, the passion, no meter if you want with God, are you still

362
00:56:15.229 --> 00:56:21.860
crazy in love with God. You spend time with God. Do you like his presence? We're talking, we were

363
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:28.610
talking a lot about mindfulness, meditation. That's something is really ha ha. Awesome. And again, I

364
00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:36.050
really, uh I'm uh for an apostle, but I really see the benefits of that. That's really awesome. You

365
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:43.020
want to bring that to another level mindfulness, meditation on God and Jesus and his love for you,

366
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:54.320
ask him to ask him. to, to reveal you his beauty, ask him to reveal you how much He loved. You, ask

367
00:56:54.330 --> 00:57:01.979
him to reveal you how much He want to help you, ask him to know, to reveal you to yourself, being

368
00:57:01.989 --> 00:57:12.129
able to just who He is. If you want to Have that full benefits of mindfulness, benefit, mindfulness,

369
00:57:12.139 --> 00:57:19.350
meditation. Try to meditate on these things. And this will obviously nurture your relationship with

370
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:26.590
God and the, the passion that is there. If and that's what, what Jesus was having with the religious

371
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:35.969
leader and the doctor of the Law. When you're, you're, you're, you're uh summarizing. God's story to

372
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:45.800
principles and love. That's, that's a major offense. It's like that's no matter. Yeah, Jesus was not

373
00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:54.179
a fool when he decided to enter in the temple with a, he was not like it was just like, oh my gosh,

374
00:57:54.189 --> 00:58:02.850
they missed the point so much. OK? I love you guys. I love you to that extent. OK. Do, do you

375
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:09.919
realize that love? And this is something that's not just a one night trip? OK? It's a life trip and,

376
00:58:09.929 --> 00:58:18.179
and even if the love fades and fades out, we're building that love with him, that's always the basis

377
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:25.750
of evaluating a right relationship with God and the second components. And this is really super

378
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:32.739
important. They were having kind of the second components pretty well. But summarizing that again,

379
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:39.320
answering to some principle or some practices. But the second principle is, is really talking about

380
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:48.479
fruits about action. It needs to bloom, it needs to have an effect because otherwise it becomes

381
00:58:48.489 --> 00:58:56.860
something like kind of etheric virtual kind of, oh, I'm in love with my God and it's, oh, it's, wow,

382
00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:04.229
wonderful. I'm so blessed to have him and he's so blessed to have me. And we feel that circle of

383
00:59:04.239 --> 00:59:10.879
love and I'm just in love with him and love with a solo relationship with And again, it defeats the

384
00:59:10.889 --> 00:59:19.030
purpose that love is created to flow. It's not a static love. It's a, it's a love that needs to flow

385
00:59:19.179 --> 00:59:27.550
in us through others. And that's the reason why Jesus said to, to people at that time, extremely

386
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:36.770
important. Love your God, passion, romance, be amazed by who he is. And if you, if you're not, not

387
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:43.149
sure about why we should be amazed, ask him, he will reveal that and you'll, you'll be, you'll feel

388
00:59:43.159 --> 00:59:47.919
that love, you'll be in that love. You'll sense that you'll feel that and it will be something that

389
00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:54.729
is really tangible in your life then and only then you'll be able to have some fruit and some action

390
00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:02.760
that will uh flow from that relationship. And that's really the other part that is as important as

391
01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:08.429
the first one. If we want to have a right relationship with God, we need to be crazy in love with

392
01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:17.300
him. And we also need to have the fruits in our life that are flowing from that love. OK? And we

393
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:23.959
have many examples in the Bible. Let's just take the passages, the passage in Galician, Uh chapter

394
01:00:23.969 --> 01:00:31.500
five, verse 22 23. This we found that in. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. So the Holy Spirit produces many

395
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:35.610
fruits and those are the fruits that we are that, that we are here.

396
01:00:40.189 --> 01:00:45.500
Joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control. To name only few.

397
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:54.040
Ok. But the thing is ok and this is really important, having a right relationship with God enables

398
01:00:54.060 --> 01:01:03.600
us to change. We can be a different person. The only limit that we have in our life and we can

399
01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:12.060
decide to do to have a right relationship with God. A 20% relationship with God, right? It's right,

400
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.879
You are, you obtain 20% of the benefits with that relationship and you live your life to use

401
01:01:17.889 --> 01:01:23.229
percentage doesn't make any sense. But you, you, you got the point again. I hope for any of you who

402
01:01:23.239 --> 01:01:29.379
didn't get the point eventually just tell me after I'll revisit my example. OK? But anyway, coming

403
01:01:29.389 --> 01:01:36.340
back to that level of relationship, Then you can say that for God, it will never be able for you to

404
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:42.610
forgive that person. OK? You can see in your mind that God will never help you to uh seize that

405
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:50.100
dependence, to move over certain things that happen in your life to maybe bring consolation about

406
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:54.899
something that you have lived, whatever it is, you can choose to do that. And obviously God is a

407
01:01:54.909 --> 01:02:04.120
gentleman. It won't force you to do this. OK? But if you want, there's no limit to the extent and

408
01:02:04.129 --> 01:02:10.870
the power that that relationship can do in your life. So there's no limit and that's really the full

409
01:02:10.879 --> 01:02:17.679
potential that we can use. So having a right relationship with God is really having, it's having

410
01:02:17.689 --> 01:02:24.469
that passionate relationship, but also having these action, these fruits that our life can bear and

411
01:02:24.479 --> 01:02:33.439
that helps us to improve as a person to always develop, to always be able to move forward, to be

412
01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:40.229
able to be a better person. Day after day that the good work that has been started in our life can

413
01:02:40.429 --> 01:02:47.679
eventually flourish and bloom even more and more and more and more to the example of Jesus. That's

414
01:02:47.689 --> 01:02:53.419
the intent. That's having a right relationship with God. That's the full power that we have

415
01:02:53.429 --> 01:03:02.419
available. now, I thought that sometimes I may be unclear. OK. And I know that because sometimes in

416
01:03:02.429 --> 01:03:09.739
my life, my kids, my wife at work everywhere when I'm talking here. So people are saying, oh boy,

417
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:18.479
what is that? So I thought to include an example, OK? It may be even fuzzier. Uh but it may help

418
01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:25.550
some people also. So let's try with the example. Do you want the example or no? OK? Only one person.

419
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.669
Thank you so much,

420
01:03:28.709 --> 01:03:40.340
We'll continue uh just um uh alone, OK? You and me. about the example. next slide you just before.

421
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:48.790
Yeah. Do you remember that movie? The Notebook Women uh women say yes. Yeah. Notebook the male alpha

422
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:56.790
male in the room. Remember the new book Nope, Thank you. Alpha male. No, never look at that kind of

423
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.709
movie. So anyway, to summarize that being a male and obviously sorry, I just don't want to do the uh

424
01:04:04.719 --> 01:04:13.610
extensive review of that movie but romantic relationship between a man and a woman. for many, many,

425
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:22.459
many years, ups and downs, but they're crazy in love together kind of, eventually dementia uh when

426
01:04:22.469 --> 01:04:30.010
the hay is the woman in that movie, uh Dementia Alzheimer, she's no longer recognizing his husband.

427
01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:36.669
So a really sad story. But that guy who's there is still crazy in love with Ali. His name is Noah

428
01:04:37.239 --> 01:04:43.429
that gave the name of our son by the way. So uh so Noah is still crazy in love and she's visiting

429
01:04:43.439 --> 01:04:50.600
her Daily at the hospice and making sure she and care and recounts many, many times their love

430
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:54.719
stories, so wonderful romantic uh passage in that movie.

431
01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:03.070
The example is the following is that if you're opening that movie only at that scene where you

432
01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:10.530
seeing Noah taking care for allies, that's something really good. It's an old man volunteering for

433
01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:21.810
United Way or hide uh helping an old lady to cross the street or read them some stories. So just

434
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:29.979
good deeds really interesting like our spiritual activities that we can do. OK. And then you look at

435
01:05:29.989 --> 01:05:36.929
that movie and said, wow, that's a good movie about volunteer and being able to do good things in

436
01:05:36.939 --> 01:05:44.300
your life. But if you look at that movie with that component, only you missed the whole point. He

437
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:53.540
did that not because he was a volunteer for uh United Way or he did that out of an extensive

438
01:05:53.649 --> 01:06:01.040
romantic, crazy love that he had and that he is still having for that woman. so when you look at

439
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:07.129
that movie, only on that scene, you're missing the old point of that relationship that was so

440
01:06:07.139 --> 01:06:13.300
important also to entangle and you can't disentangle one with the other because you're missing the

441
01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:20.090
old point. And that's exactly the story about having a right relationship with Jesus. The two

442
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:26.820
components need to be tied together. Having an emphasis only on one or the other is missing the old

443
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:35.110
point missing the old story is it helps or no. and keep it the reason why I set a partially good

444
01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:40.770
example is just for you if you're looking at the movies tonight and saying, oh my gosh, let's do

445
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:48.100
this the following the follow up on that message this morning by looking at that that section and

446
01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:55.020
not really good, the section before it's not necessarily the best romantic and couple relationship.

447
01:06:55.030 --> 01:07:02.510
OK. So I just wanted to mention that. So just don't overuse the example. OK, this morning. So that's

448
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.889
it for the announcement period. OK.

449
01:07:07.929 --> 01:07:18.659
So, having said all of that. If you want to experiment, uh if, if we want to experiment uh a right

450
01:07:18.669 --> 01:07:26.429
relationship with God and when we arrive at the end of our days, making sure that we, we've lived

451
01:07:26.439 --> 01:07:33.090
that life, we need those two components that are tied together. When we evaluate our relationship,

452
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:40.159
our level of relationship, You can even use a grid for a couple relationship and you will be able to

453
01:07:40.169 --> 01:07:45.610
have some criteria to help you discern where you stand and what could be improved with your

454
01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:53.229
relationship with God. And you can look also at the, the action and your life. How do you progress

455
01:07:53.239 --> 01:08:02.639
in terms of fruit that are uh flowing from that love from God? So Having said all of this, this

456
01:08:02.649 --> 01:08:12.580
morning, Jesus, why is it so important it's just because he showed us a way, he paved the way to a

457
01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:19.629
new life. He opened that he made that relationship possible. That's really what Jesus did. OK. He

458
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:30.350
made that relationship possible. Because initially trying to live that there was two concept look at

459
01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:36.009
what the Jewish people were living before they were entangled in something way different way, much

460
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:45.580
complex that were, was not this at all. And now he opening us that new door for that kind of life

461
01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:53.069
that is now available for all of us. And as I mentioned earlier, it's only at the reach of a

462
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.970
decision to say, I want to be in relationship with you, Jesus. I give you my life, I certainly up

463
01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:04.209
control over my life. And this could be one prayer for you this morning. If you want to experiment

464
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:10.810
that kind of relationship with God, another prayer topic for us this morning is certainly the fact

465
01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:16.869
that if you're not in love with God, if you maybe lose sight of that, OK? Or, or less in love

466
01:09:16.878 --> 01:09:23.829
because obviously, you see at the intellectual level, we're always say, yes, I love Jesus because

467
01:09:23.838 --> 01:09:29.429
you're in a relationship with him and you love him, but maybe it's not as passionate as it was

468
01:09:29.438 --> 01:09:36.458
before. Let's prefer that also this morning. That's certainly something that is at your reach and

469
01:09:36.469 --> 01:09:43.169
lastly if in your life. You said there's a and there's still problem that you're trying to fix and

470
01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:47.939
that you're struggling with and you're still doing that maybe on your own effort. And I have not

471
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:55.549
think about surrounding, surrounding this, surrounding this yet to Jesus or maybe some Maria that

472
01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:03.830
you've just said It's out of his cope. He can't do anything about that situation. I invite you also

473
01:10:03.839 --> 01:10:10.419
to pray for that this morning because there's nothing out of his reach. It's a matter of are we

474
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:19.910
share and leaving that to him or not? And let him also show us how we want to untangle these things

475
01:10:19.919 --> 01:10:26.089
in our lives. So that will be the three prayer topics. Does it make sense? Yeah. So let's stand up

476
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.390
together and we'll finish with a word of prayer

477
01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:45.319
So thank you Jesus for uh the opportunity we're having here uh to just be able to explore a little

478
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:52.000
bit more what you've done here on earth, what the example you gave to us and what you're still doing

479
01:10:53.180 --> 01:11:01.729
and want to do I pray you this morning for any person here that has never took the decision to

480
01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:09.910
answer to your love and you're pursuing us day after day from the foundation of the earth. to be

481
01:11:09.919 --> 01:11:18.160
able to accept, your love. So I pray you this morning for the person this morning that would like to

482
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:19.729
have that relationship with you

483
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:29.310
and this, as I mentioned is as simple as saying Jesus, I give you my life. for those of us who are

484
01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:36.040
struggling in your passion with you, in that love that we have for you in that experience when we're

485
01:11:36.049 --> 01:11:42.729
praying or when we're singing or coming to the church or trying all pairings of stuff and we're no

486
01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:50.859
longer feeling the love and we're not no longer having that passion I'm praying for all of us this

487
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:58.310
morning also. and for some of us that may have given up on some aspect in our lifes saying that it's

488
01:11:58.319 --> 01:12:04.290
too big for you to handle or that we no longer have the strength to overcome these difficulties or

489
01:12:04.299 --> 01:12:11.720
those problems, I pray for all of us also this morning to help us and just give us like the, the,

490
01:12:11.729 --> 01:12:19.979
the faith, the renewed uh vision for these elements to be solved with your help because we're no

491
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:29.779
longer alone. so in your name, we pray amen Jesus. I mean, And

492
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.890
but seriously comments and salt feedback. Always welcome. Have a wonderful Sunday.

493
01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:45.700
he

494
01:12:48.089 --> 01:12:52.149
And Lorenzo and Michelle are watching like now we can stay on extended vacation. We're, we're, we're

495
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.169
in good hands.

496
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:04.810
um So I'm a little shook. That was, I really needed to hear that word personally. Um Feels a little

497
01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:09.430
bit like inappropriate to kind of sing after that. Like because singing means nothing without

498
01:13:09.439 --> 01:13:18.729
surrender. Service means nothing without surrender. Um So yeah, like let's let's kind of maybe

499
01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.790
instead of outwardly, let's look inwardly for a minute. If you have, if you're here with your loved

500
01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:30.100
ones, uh if you need to make something right with somebody, if you need healing. Let's just let's

501
01:13:30.109 --> 01:13:35.470
just kind of open up this space for, for some prayer um for some quiet time with you, one on one

502
01:13:35.479 --> 01:13:42.140
with the Lord. Um yeah, and nobody leave. I see some of y'all we, we see you, some, some people

503
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:49.089
might be trying to sneak out but take this moment seriously, take this moment. Um And this is in,

504
01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:54.720
you know, together like we can do these moments at home by ourselves but so beautiful to have a

505
01:13:54.729 --> 01:14:03.009
moment like this in community, you know, with everyone together. So band will keep playing. That's

506
01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:07.299
just, let's just rest in God's presence, whatever that looks like for you

507
01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:37.399
And there's nothing

508
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:42.459
some but

509
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.750
I've seen this one together.

510
01:15:55.799 --> 01:15:57.069
I've got a friend,

511
01:16:00.509 --> 01:16:01.580
or so then

512
01:16:05.069 --> 01:16:10.850
There is no judgment or how he knows. I've got a friend

513
01:16:13.959 --> 01:16:15.859
he is my dream

514
01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:28.490
I sure he's with me in the valley, with me in the fire, with me in

515
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:45.419
who

516
01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:50.680
