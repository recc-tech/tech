00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.510
about Samson and redemption. So that's the theme for today. We want to know that. I want you to know

3
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:11.410

6
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.600
today is "Yes He Can." Let's get the groove going.

20
00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.180
Alright. We're gonna sing this new song called "The One" from Mosaic. We've only done it one time

21
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.340
before. It's got a nice groove.

35
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.760
We're gonna sing the song "Everlasting Light." It's another Mosaic song.

57
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:36.840
How we doing today, River's Edge? We can do a little bit better. How we doing today guys? Yes sir. Yes sir.

61
00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:03.670

65
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:30.320
God is for you. He's not a statue, he's not vibe, he's not an energy, he's the living reigning king

66
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:36.460
of kings and Lord of lords. And so this song, this song is anthemic for that, whatever you're going

166
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:20.670
So the kids program is happening in the annex for the young adults as well and the Children. But

167
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:25.490
instead of rushing off to do that now we are waiting for Lorenzo to come after doing the Bible study

168

172
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:49.850
the party.

173
00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.870
Well, I should say welcome to myself.

174
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:45.440
I missed the whole first part, but I'm glad that you guys were here for it. Um, sorry for the bit of

175
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:52.950
different type of gathering. I'm sure you guys didn't mind it at all enjoy the refreshing break.

176
00:55:52.960 --> 00:56:00.200
It's always good, right? I just came from the stadium because the Alouettes were having their first

177
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:07.260
home playoff game and I don't know how long it never happens that it's on a Sunday. And so I had to

178
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:13.480
go there first and then I made my way here and thank you to the worship team and to a refreshment

179
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:19.420
break team. Then we have just the best volunteers of River's Edge that can pull this off and make

180
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:28.440
this happen. And so as the kids in the youth just make their way to the annex for their classes,

181
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:35.030
we're gonna wrap up this series. But this time for Reals, I said that last week. But then when I

182
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:42.220
thought about it, as I was preparing for the next series, I said, you know what? There's one message

183
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:48.290
that I really feel God is putting on my heart to share with all of you in regards to this fresh

184
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:58.270
start series. And it's on the subject of redemption and there's such a great redemption story in the

185
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:06.200
scriptures that I wanted to share with you and it's a story of Samson. Samson was set apart from

186
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:19.820
birth so that he would be a prophet, a judge. And in many ways he would be the voice and the heart

187
00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:31.110
of God protecting his people from their enemies. And so an angel of the Lord appeared to Samson's

188
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:38.380
parents and told them that they had to be different in the way that they were going to raise this

189
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:47.260
son. That this son would be different than other sons that had been born in their tribe before. That

190
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:53.810
he would be set apart with a set of vows. And these vows would be the vows that he would have to

191
00:57:53.820 --> 00:58:04.120
maintain the rest of his life so that God would bless him and through him, his people. And so his

192
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:13.250
parents did what they were supposed to do. And they imparted all of this information to their son.

193
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:22.370
And they made it clear who he was to be and and who he had been called to even become and everything

194
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:34.200
that they did was now come to an end. And Samson had to now lead his own life. And I think there's a

195
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:42.300
moment for all of us when we feel like we're ready to set off on our own, we're ready to do our own

196
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:50.230
thing, be our own person, live our own life. And the things that have been imparted to us those

197
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:58.140
things, we take them into consideration. But there may be no longer the boundaries by which we live

198
00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:06.350
our lives. There are no longer the set of instructions by which we decide how we are going to make

199
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:15.420
decisions in the day to day. And so we take the opportunity with this newfound freedom to set our

200
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:23.240
own course to lay out our own path, to make our own decisions, to choose our own friends and be in

201
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:33.670
the relationships that we want to be in. And Samson never experience what it was like to not have

202
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:43.510
God with him, that even when he was making poor decisions and even when he was selecting the wrong

203
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:56.930
relationships, God's power, when Samson called upon God to intervene, God always did. And so Samson

204
00:59:56.930 --> 01:00:06.260
got into the pattern and habit in his life that he could keep testing God,

205
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.980
pushing the boundaries,

206
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:24.170
living the way that he wanted, but still love God and be obedient to him. When it came to fighting

207
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:40.230
Israel's enemies. And so Samson went out into the world with an invisible armor, an armor that no

208
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:52.150
one could physically see on him, but an armor that was always on him. And no one could understand

209
01:00:52.150 --> 01:01:01.570
where the power and the strength was coming to defeat his enemies, the way that he would do it. It

210
01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:11.500
didn't matter how many there were or what he had or didn't have at his disposal, he was always able

211
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:23.620
to win. And it didn't make sense to those around him and everyone tried to get to his secret. And so

212
01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:35.590
they inserted a woman into his life by the name of Delilah and this woman was being paid as a spy to

213
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:47.010
be in Samson's life and to make sure that he would eventually divulge his secret of what gave him

214
01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:58.410
this power. What gave him this strength and how he was always able to defeat his enemies without

215
01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:04.280
realizing it. Samson was sleeping with the enemy

216
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:17.040
and he didn't see all that was planned and schemed and orchestrated to bring him down and the

217
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:28.880
scriptures tell us that eventually, that's exactly what happens. Samson is defeated And in judges 16

218
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:39.690
In verse 23 we see that the philistine rulers held a great festival and they were offering

219
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:49.510
sacrifices and they were praising their God Dagon and they said our God has given us victory over

220
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:57.750
our enemy Samson And when the people saw him they praised their God saying our God has delivered our

221
01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:06.280
enemy to us. The one who killed so many of us is now in our power. And now the people have drunk by

222
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:14.160
now demanded bring out Samson so that he can amuse us. And so he was brought from the prison to

223
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:21.000
amuse them and they had him stand between the pillars and they were supporting the roof and Samson

224
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.030
said to the young servant who was leading him by the hand place my hands against the pillars that

225
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:33.990
hold up the temple and I want to rest against him And now the temple was completely filled with

226
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:39.820
people and all the philistine rulers were there and there were about 3000 men and women on the roof

227
01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:47.690
who were watching as Samson amused them. And then Samson prayed to the Lord this prayer, he said,

228
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:53.690
Sovereign Lord! Remember me again. Oh God! Please strengthen me just one more time with one blow.

229
01:03:53.700 --> 01:04:01.770
Let me pay back the Philistines for the loss of my two eyes. And then Samson put his hands on the

230
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:08.420
two center pillars that held up the temple and pushing against them with both hands. He prayed, let

231
01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:15.960
me die with the Philistines. And the temple crashed down on the philistine rulers and all the people.

232
01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:27.990
And so he killed more people when he died than he had during his entire lifetime. Mhm. In the

233
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.410
passage that we just read,

234
01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:45.310
we see the destruction but we also see the redemption of a life. We see what happens when we take

235
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:51.780
God for granted and we take the power that he has given us and the armor that he has put on us and

236
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.960
we live our life believing that we cannot be touched.

237
01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:09.530
And we make assumptions about what that looks like for each of us through the decisions that we make

238
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:19.500
without realizing that each one of those decisions is leading us further and further from the very

239
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:33.640
power and armor that is enabling us to live victorious. And as Samson didn't notice it leaving him

240
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:47.470
So too, it is true with us. And so we are going to now revisit the story but we're gonna do it now

241
01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:59.280
in reverse. You see in judges 16 verse 15 and 16 it says that Delilah pouts how can you tell me? I

242
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:07.400
love you when you don't share your secrets with me, you've made fun of me three times now and you

243
01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:16.910
still haven't told me what makes you so strong. And she tormented him with her nagging day after day

244
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:27.720
until he was sick to death of it. The scriptures show us in this passage that Samson so full of the

245
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:39.020
spirit is slowly being worn down and when you think that you are resisting the enemy, what you don't

246
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:50.070
understand about the enemy is that the enemy never ever gives up on bringing you down that for every

247
01:06:50.070 --> 01:07:00.010
time you resist, the enemy just digs in and goes further and further and is willing to go longer and

248
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:09.130
longer and is willing to do more and more. Each and every time that it is required. The nagging that

249
01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:16.430
we see here isn't a woman nagging a man in the way that we would understand it, but it is a woman

250
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:24.920
determined to defeat her enemy. She has a mission. That mission is to destroy Samson who's been

251
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:33.510
destroying her people. She doesn't love Samson. Samson has somehow fallen in love with her. But what

252
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:40.730
is happening in the story is that instead of Samson staying in love with God, he is choosing someone

253
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:47.780
else to share his secrets with and put his trust in

254
01:07:49.900 --> 01:08:00.680
and rely on and depend on for his future and the moment that we do that without realizing it in

255
01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:12.100
incremental steps. We are being worn down until we finally give in. And what happens in the story is

256
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:19.280
that on three different occasions Sampson tells her something that's going to take away his strength,

257
01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:29.220
but each one of those things was not true and amazingly, every time the Philistines show up based on

258
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:37.170
his instructions of how he should be tied up and what should be done with his hair, that all of a

259
01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:46.270
sudden he is able to break free each time. And yet each time Samson does the unthinkable, he goes

260
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:54.400
back into the arms of Delilah and we've done this, we've been there, we've seen ourselves do. The

261
01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:02.520
very thing that we know is ultimately bringing about our own destruction. We know what it looks like

262
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:11.750
to give in and essentially to give up into what we believe are are just passions and desires and and

263
01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:18.930
ultimately our decisions, which we feel in the moment, they're just better to live with than to live

264
01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:19.770
without.

265
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:28.220
We've all been there, We've all done this. But what we don't understand is that we can be so full of

266
01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:35.110
the Holy Spirit when this happens that the Holy Spirit can't be taken out of us all at once. And so

267
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:43.150
the enemy comes and just takes it out a bit at a time and I wonder where is it in my life that I am

268
01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:54.490
leaking the Holy Spirit, the way that we can sometimes leak air and no longer hold our original form

269
01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.540
and purpose.

270
01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:06.390
And it's so true that in the story that in verses 17 and 19 finally we see that Samson shares his

271
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:12.670
secret with her and then he just lets it out. And I think there's a moment in which we just become

272
01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:19.810
so worn down and so vulnerable. But more importantly, we are so emptied of the one thing that holds

273
01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:26.130
us strong which is the presence of God that we are willing to go the whole way when before we were

274
01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:34.180
still resisting it, most of it, we're giving in now and the reason we're giving in is because

275
01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:42.810
there's nothing left to fight. The Spirit is gone, the armor is gone. And now Samson gives up his

276
01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:53.330
secret and he says, my hair has never been cut for I have dedicated myself to God as a Nazareth from

277
01:10:53.340 --> 01:11:00.090
birth. And if my head were shaved, my strength would leave me and I would become as weak as anyone

278
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:08.690
else. And the moment that he says this, look at what happens next. Delilah lulled Samson to sleep

279
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:17.710
with his head in her lap. And then she called in a man to shave off the seven locks of his hair and

280
01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:28.230
in this way she began to bring him down and his strength left him. That's something, it didn't

281
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:34.170
happen all at once did it happened over a period of time and that's the way the enemy works. That's

282
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:39.790
what he does, and this is how he does it. This is what he tries to do with all of us. And I'm

283
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:45.160
wondering, are we ignorant to the schemes and to the activities of the enemy in our own life right

284
01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.600
now? Are we like somehow just so enamored with ourselves, our decisions, the person, we're with the

285
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.420
choices. We're making the path that we're on. The journey that we've taken. The destination that we

286
01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:06.290
believe is ultimately where we are supposed to end up. That we just are willing to give it all away.

287
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:16.750
And I don't think that if you were brought to your senses in a moment in which you were at your

288
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:25.410
weakest, that you would possibly most probably not even have the strength to say, I do not have it

289
01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:36.380
in me to resist anymore, because that's exactly what happened to Samson. So Samson shares his secret

290
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:42.880
and he shares his life purpose. But look at this, he does it with the wrong one.

291
01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:54.900
And I I believe that God has someone for all of us. I truly do believe that. I also believe that God

292
01:12:54.900 --> 01:13:02.980
has someone that we have to be willing to wait for when God brings that person into our life. That

293
01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:09.680
if we do not wait the way that God has instructed us to wait and we try to bring this in by our own

294
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.470
means or by their own insistence.

295
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:24.020
Then in that moment you have to understand that there are two things that are at work here. One,

296
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:28.990
this person wants this more than me. There's a reason for that

297
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:35.380
two, I want this more than them. There is a reason for that.

298
01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:46.430
And I tell you that anytime you see in the scriptures, any one of those two things happening,

299
01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.630
it is never God in the midst of it.

300
01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:09.580
Yeah, but when you are brought together God's way there is this connection that happens and it

301
01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:19.420
happens because not because you forced it and not because someone else insisted on it, but because

302
01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:30.880
God's plan has brought you together. Sometimes that plan comes about in the most unexpected of ways.

303
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:40.810
It comes in a way that you never would have prepared yourself for. I went to high school with my

304
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.720
wife and I never noticed her,

305
01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:58.140
I left Montreal. I went to Italy studied theology, I met a girl there, I was engaged to be married.

306
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:05.150
I pastored in Italy I pastored in boston through a series of circumstances, my mom got sick, I

307
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:10.950
decided to come back to Montreal to be home and to help my parents. I thought this would be one of

308
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:15.380
the opportunities there. At that same time I had an opportunity to pastor in new york and in

309
01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:21.530
philadelphia and all these things were happening and during this season of my life where things were

310
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:29.660
so confusing and I was torn in pieces literally between people and cities and churches and

311
01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:38.620
opportunities. I made the decision that unless God made it abundantly clear, I would not make a

312
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:44.140
decision because I knew that I could not trust my heart,

313
01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:56.560
everything in my life was teaching me and telling me that there was a better opportunity here and

314
01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:06.510
there was a lot of pressure for there, but none of it would sit right with me when I was alone and

315
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:13.720
it was just me and God trying to figure this out. And I knew that if I had listened to the pressures

316
01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.170
that were around me and were coming at me, that would make the wrong decision, I would make the

317
01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.210
wrong choice.

318
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:31.940
And so the relationship in Italy ended, I didn't go back to boston, I did not take the positions

319
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:39.190
available to me in philadelphia and in new york and I stayed in Montreal instead

320
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:48.950
and every day I wondered if I had made the right decision and during this time I'm single again and

321
01:16:48.950 --> 01:17:00.020
single for several years and and I get asked to do a retreat for young adults at a ski hill in

322
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:08.070
Vermont and there for the first time I really saw my wife

323
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:19.360
and then I understood this is why I had stayed and from that moment it took several more years

324
01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.860
before I even had the courage to ask her out because it's always weird when a pastor asks out

325
01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:25.270
somebody in their church,

326
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:34.500
it's just wrong, it's just it's not just weird, it's just wrong. So you don't do it. And so I just

327
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:41.190
didn't do it. And until finally I just realized that I had to do it and it was like I couldn't hold

328
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:48.080
back anymore. And so when I when I finally did that, she said this is really weird.

329
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.700
I don't know if I can do this

330
01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.600
and it's been weird ever since. And so

331
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.410
let's continue with Samson

332
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:15.720
because it doesn't get weirder than this. Um but but in Samson's life, we see that he's so full of

333
01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:21.950
the Holy Spirit, but he's slowly being worn down. He shares his secret and his life purpose with the

334
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:30.200
wrong person and that leads to him being blinded. It's not by coincidence, not only not only do they

335
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:36.260
arrest him in prison, but they blind him, They torture him, they make sure that he could never see

336
01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:40.340
again. And I look at that and I said that's not a coincidence because he had already been

337
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:46.430
spiritually blinded and sometimes we're spiritually blinded way before we're physically blinded. We

338
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:50.740
don't see what's right in front of us and he couldn't see what was right in front of him and he was

339
01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:56.990
missing out on what he was supposed to be doing and he didn't wait for who God would bring into his

340
01:18:56.990 --> 01:19:01.410
life. And so the Philistines brought someone instead

341
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:07.840
and you see this is what you have to remember that. That that if that if God if you don't wait for

342
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.830
God to fill the vacancies in your life, the enemy will always fill them for him.

343
01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.990
We have to let God fill the vacancies

344
01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.440
otherwise the devil will

345
01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:40.150
and and every opportunity that we take to be for God is is an opportunity that we have to experience

346
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:48.370
what God wants to bring into our life. And it's better to wait and and and possibly get it wrong

347
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:56.660
than than to act and and get it wrong. Honestly, I've seen people act saying you know I have to just

348
01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:00.850
make a move. No you need to wait on the Lord.

349
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:11.570
Now. I just gotta step out in faith. No, you gotta find a room, lock yourself in there

350
01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:20.530
and pray and and don't get out of that room until God makes it clear what your next step is.

351
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:26.470
See we always take faith as an excuse

352
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:32.330
for us acting rebelliously.

353
01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:39.260
It is not faith, it's rebellion When we move without God.

354
01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:47.690
Even when God gave Moses the opportunity to move without him. And he said I'm still going to fulfill

355
01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:53.250
my promise Moses said I'm not going anywhere unless you come with me.

356
01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:02.740
And that's when you see that that Moses cared more about his relationship with God than he cared

357
01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:08.780
about the destination. But I'll tell you there's a lot of people in this room where we care more

358
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:15.810
about the destination than the relationship with God. We care way more about the outcome than we do

359
01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:21.930
about what it looks like to be obedient to him. And I'm telling you that Samson was doing exactly

360
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:27.340
that he was experiencing victory after victory. So he wasn't paying attention to the spiritual life,

361
01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:32.880
you know, because he kept he kept winning. You know, when you're winning, when you're winning, it's

362
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:36.400
hard to to see yourself as the loser that you really are

363
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:49.310
right. I've been in that position where I was winning, but I was actually losing. I was I was not a

364
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:55.720
winner. I was a loser except except everything around me was telling me that I was winning, but I

365
01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:08.600
wasn't. And by the time Samson figures is out, his hair is cut, he's in prison, he's been

366
01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.580
tortured and his eyes have been taken from him.

367
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:17.780
The Bible tells us in verse 20 that he cries out.

368
01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:27.880
Mhm. There's there's a there's a cry out and the crying out isn't done by Samson here, it's it's

369
01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:34.590
Delilah. And she says, Samson, the Philistines have come to capture you. And when he woke up, look

370
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:40.260
at this, this is how deluded he was when he woke up, he thought I will do as before and I will just

371
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:53.140
shake myself free. But he didn't realize that the Lord had left him. Come on. Come on, come on. He

372
01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:59.450
just thought it was just gonna be another day, another day. Like all the other days before another

373
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:05.270
opportunity for him to show everyone what a winner he was, how he was going to be victorious, how he

374
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:11.560
had this, how he got this, how there's no one who can touch that, nothing can happen to him, no one

375
01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:18.120
could touch this. But what happened instead is that the Lord had left him and he was completely

376
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:30.250
vulnerable to what satan had for him. Next, Samson got up to fight believing that nothing had

377
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:40.510
changed. Have you ever had your behind handed to you in a spiritual battle? It happened to the

378
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:45.820
disciples when Jesus was sending them out and he was saying you can do anything in my name and there

379
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:51.880
were people who thought that the name of Jesus was going to be enough without the relationship.

380
01:23:55.530 --> 01:24:02.050
They thought it was going to be enough to note the name of Jesus and go into battle against demonic

381
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:13.290
forces and believe that they would come out winners instead they didn't realize but Jesus was in the

382
01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:15.720
background saying, I don't know these dudes,

383
01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.500
they know the brand,

384
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:33.440
they wear the brand right? They look good with the brand on but they ain't affiliated with me.

385
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:45.450
These guys are rogue, they're on their own, they are not with me. So you can go ahead and kick their

386
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:59.460
behinds and the demons did exactly that because they thought it was enough to know and not to be and

387
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:06.920
what we often expect is a blessing in our lives just because we know

388
01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.980
knowing doesn't bring the blessing

389
01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.510
being is the blessing

390
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:30.460
and what Jesus wants is for us to learn from Samson not fall into the same trap. And so Samson, who

391
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:38.080
was once so full of the spirit, didn't even realize, recognize when it was finally gone and then

392
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:44.980
judges 16 20 to look at what happens next. But before long look at this, I love it because this is

393
01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:56.390
the redemption part of the story, but before long his hair began to grow back, wow. And you see

394
01:25:56.390 --> 01:26:01.990
what's happening is that this is not just a story of one man's coiffure, right?

395
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:11.140
This is not important. The length of his hair is nothing, it is not that, but it's the fact what it

396
01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:17.910
represents, right? And so when the hair was growing back, I want you to understand that redemption

397
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:27.430
was coming back, the presence of God was coming back, the power of his presence was working in

398
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:37.790
Samson. And as he had to walk around the mill grinding the grain in the prison every day, no one

399
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:45.710
paid attention to the fact that his hair was starting to grow again and with each day that it grew

400
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:54.520
with each moment that it got longer. God's presence was getting stronger in Samson's life until he

401
01:26:54.520 --> 01:27:03.980
got to the point where God creates and orchestrates the moment in which Samson can redeem himself

402
01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:11.680
and I'm telling you that a lot of our lives look just like this, they start off right, we do a lot

403
01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.540
of wasting it in the middle. And then at the end we figure things out and we do better anybody else.

404
01:27:20.190 --> 01:27:27.210
Yeah. So, so this is what's happening to Samson and now that he's like figuring things out, he's

405
01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:35.430
realizing that it doesn't matter if he lives or dies, but he just wants to die, making sure that his

406
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:42.140
enemies defeated because that was his calling, That was his purpose. He knew that he had to have

407
01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:48.740
been a judge and a protector of his people. He failed him in that and for years as he languished in

408
01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:56.800
that prison and as he, the name of God was being mocked and the name of a false god named Dagon was

409
01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:04.670
being praised. He realized that all of this was because of him. All of this happened because he just

410
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.860
couldn't see even when his eyes were still in his head.

411
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:18.480
And so in the passage that we can finally

412
01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:28.880
rejoice with kind of like that movie that shows you just a little bit of glimmer of hope and you get

413
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:38.550
excited because you see that maybe this is where the comeback happens and that's what this verse

414
01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:51.270
well placed does. But before long his hair began to grow back in prison blind and humiliated. Yet

415
01:28:51.280 --> 01:29:01.190
there was hope. Can we all cheer to that? And there was hope. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but like for you,

416
01:29:01.190 --> 01:29:12.590
for you. And yet his hair grew back and there was hope. There was hope. So no matter what's happened,

417
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:19.130
no matter what you've been through, no matter what's been taken from you, do you get this when the

418
01:29:19.130 --> 01:29:27.040
holy Spirit comes back and the Holy Spirit starts to increase in our life and gives us back our

419
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.460
strength and our invisible armor.

420
01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:44.630
Then all of a sudden we have our purpose and our power back to do incredible things in his name In

421
01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:52.250
verse 30 it says that he prayed and he says these things he says you know let me die and the temple

422
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:57.850
crashed down on the philistine rulers in the temple, all the people died, he killed more people when

423
01:29:57.850 --> 01:30:04.580
he died than he had during his entire lifetime. Now that versus like it's cool but it's super sad

424
01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:12.260
right? Because like you get it, it never had to get to that God wanted Samson to die like a natural

425
01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:16.370
death like everybody else, you know on the couch watching tv, like that's what you probably

426
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:17.600
envisioned for him, you know,

427
01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:30.500
but but instead he dies a very different death and death that he dies is all because he realizes the

428
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:38.310
missteps and the mistakes that led him to this point, but look at how God Steel is able to not only

429
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:45.200
redeem him but redeem the story and you know that If we ever wonder like what happened to Samson, is

430
01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:51.290
this the end of the story. Well, the Bible tells us in hebrews chapter 11 that he is recognized as

431
01:30:51.290 --> 01:31:00.620
one of the heroes of the faith. So we know that God like and Thrones him in in in this Redemption

432
01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:09.280
forever. We're still talking about Samson because he didn't live well. But but he died well. He died

433
01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:17.560
for a purpose that that could have been avoided, but one that gave him back his glory and his honor

434
01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:25.400
and the respect in his people's eyes and for all the lives that had been lost during the time that

435
01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:31.290
he had been captured and imprisoned. The Bible says that it makes it clear he killed more people on

436
01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:38.110
that day than on any day that he was alive. And that tells me something really important for all of

437
01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:42.640
us. And that is that God is always able to make up lost time.

438
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:54.800
He is always able to make up squandered opportunities. He's able to take that which is wasted and

439
01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:03.060
what we think is lost and redeem it and bring it back and do it all at once. Can we say amen to that.

440
01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:17.360
Come on. Yes, that's what he does. And I'm so blessed to be able to share this with you today

441
01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:23.580
because the question I have for you at the end here is where do we find ourselves in our

442
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:31.710
relationship with God? I want you to pay attention to where it is that you may be leaking the Holy

443
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:39.180
Spirit. I want to ask you another question. Where are the signs that maybe the Holy Spirit is

444
01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.120
leaving you?

445
01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:47.780
Where are they in your life right now that you don't maybe pay attention enough to but you're not

446
01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:54.060
noticing it. But every day that you decide to do the opposite of what he's asking you to do that,

447
01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.990
the Holy Spirit is just leaving you just a little bit at a time

448
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:07.040
and here's the last thing. It is never too late for any of us to turn back to God and experience

449
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:17.380
redemption right now. That is not a question. That is a statement. That is a truth that we can truly,

450
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:23.700
truly embrace. Amen God bless you guys. Thanks for listening. And let's

451
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:36.230
wrap this up. Would you stand with me and we're gonna just close in a word of prayer. And I want you

452
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:41.710
to just you know, in your own mind and your heart and your own thoughts um just come before God and

453
01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:52.110
just say God, you know, I want to have a deep and meaningful relationship with you. I want you to

454
01:33:52.110 --> 01:34:01.280
stop the leaking in my life. I want you to not allow for the Holy Spirit to escape me anymore. And I

455
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.550
want you to turn my life and my story into a redemption story right now. So father, I want to thank

456
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:12.210
you for every person that is here for the great things that you've done in them and through the

457
01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:18.230
mistakes and through the lessons and through the heart learnings and the through the Brokenness and

458
01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:23.880
the things that have been lost and wasted and then I look to each and every one of us myself

459
01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:29.500
included and I say thank you God that we are all redemption stories. Thank you. That this is a

460
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:34.630
moment in which we can come back to you that we can give ourselves to you that we don't have to give

461
01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:40.660
in to the schemes of the enemy. That Lord, we can trust you, that we can believe in you, that we can

462
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:48.410
emphatically just put our faith in you fully right now and ask that your presence, your spirit would

463
01:34:48.420 --> 01:35:00.670
increase in each of us and as you would do that Lord that you would cover us with your armor that

464
01:35:00.670 --> 01:35:09.420
gives us victory in the battle in Jesus name. We pray Amen. Amen. God bless you guys thank you so

465
01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.130
much.

466
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.560

469
01:35:39.330 --> 01:35:45.870
four. I don't know how many people are in your family and how many people you don't want in your

470
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:46.680
