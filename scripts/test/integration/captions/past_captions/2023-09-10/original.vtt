WEBVTT

1
00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:21.989
Well, welcome everybody. We're so glad that you can be here. And I'd like to open this gathering by

2
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.480
saying uh blessed are those that are punctual. Can we say amen to that? It's always good.

3
00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:39.359
Can you guys stand as we would open in a word of prayer? I just want to welcome you to River's Edge.

4
00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:45.609
We're gonna have an amazing time of worship. Our kids ministry starts at 10 30. Our youth is already

5
00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:51.339
meeting at 10 o'clock and uh we have a wonderful gathering that is planned for you today. Uh We have

6
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:57.630
a timely message, I believe that is gonna kick off our new, that's called turning point. And uh

7
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.929
today we're gonna be talking about how the principle is the promise. And as you worship together

8
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:10.690
today, I want you to just give yourself over entirely to the Lord. Uh hold nothing back and even in

9
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.920
those moments in which it's gonna be a challenge to do. So because of the maybe distract thoughts

10
00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:21.739
that you're having, maybe because of the, the Brokenness that you're experiencing in your life,

11
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.970
maybe because of the challenges that you're facing, maybe because things are going so well. You kind

12
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:33.429
of like, maybe don't feel like there's a whole lot, maybe that you even just need to be in the

13
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.169
presence of the Lord. For sometimes we can think like that and we can go through things just like

14
00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:46.640
that. But when we go into the presence of God, this is what I've always discovered that God has

15
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:55.559
something new to reveal to each of us. And if you will be open in your mind and in your heart, you

16
00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:02.929
will see what God wants you to see today. Are you ready for that? And so father, thank you for every

17
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.440
person here for the life they represent, for the family that they represent. You know, where it is

18
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:15.679
that they need you most in and where they're looking to you for a breakthrough where it is that they

19
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:22.559
need healing and where it is that they need reconciliation, where it is that they need clarity,

20
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:30.010
where they need direction in terms of the next steps and decisions that need to be made. Lord, you

21
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:40.030
are a God who is able to reveal to each of us what those steps need to be. You say that you order

22
00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:48.190
them. I pray that you would order ours so that we can experience your fullness and your blessing

23
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:54.349
today. Thank you for this moment of worship. Thank you for your word that is going to speak to our

24
00:09:54.359 --> 00:10:01.719
hearts. Thank you for all that will take place on this day. To glorify you. I pray that it would

25
00:10:01.729 --> 00:10:08.760
also edify us. And we ask these things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Let's worship together. Would you

26
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.349

29
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.280

let's sing holy.

There is no one. Thank you. There is none

63
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.309

00:16:26.409 --> 00:16:29.580
we're going to sing those songs, those words again worthy of every song.

65
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.349
What every

66
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.669
is worthy of all.

67
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:44.549
Yeah,

68
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.099

for you, live for you Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank you Lord Jesus. You can

70
00:16:59.640 --> 00:16:59.940
is a

71
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.489
that

72
00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:07.639
is the only

73
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.170
everywhere because me, please,

74
00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:01.030
let's tell him we're gonna build our life. We want him to be at the bottom of the firm foundation,

75
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:08.530
our Lord and savior build for everything we want to build. Let him be on the line. Hallelujah sing,

76
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.010
I will build my life upon your life, upon your love

77
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.329
a time.

78
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:38.420

79
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.180
I will you say

80
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:48.810
yeah.

81
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.329
A

82
00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:50.339
I do.

83
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:58.550
Mhm

84
00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:02.780
With your heart

85
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.910
in your

86
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.910
who you

87
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:42.050
This next song we're singing before the message is called "Gratitude." Oh! the words of these songs.

88
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:50.390
Oh my gosh, all my words fall short. I got nothing new. How could I express all my gratitude? And

89
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:58.670
that's what we're here to do today is to thank him, to praise him, to show him how much we are

90
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:06.339
grateful for his love, for never giving up. But these words really, really seem to you sing together

91
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:20.000
with us all my words for sure. I've got nothing new. How could express

92
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.020
attitude?

93
00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:28.250
I could sing these

94
00:21:30.579 --> 00:21:32.250
as I often

95
00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:36.150
deliveries.

96
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.680
So I cry. Praise you

97
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.819
the I

98
00:21:57.069 --> 00:21:57.280
Yeah,

99
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:10.829
but it for a, except for a heart singing

100
00:22:23.719 --> 00:22:24.410
have gone.

101
00:22:28.469 --> 00:22:29.859
I've got just one

102
00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:34.689
with my arms stretching away.

103
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.260
Yeah.

104
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.770
Yeah. Pray

105
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.010
key

106
00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:06.699
seven.

107
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:29.319
We're going to sing. Come on my soul. Let's not be shy. Let's worship him. Oh God. So don't you get

108
00:23:29.329 --> 00:23:39.489
shy? A pure song? Cause you got a lion inside of those songs. Get up and pray. No.

109
00:24:39.109 --> 00:24:39.130
To.

110
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:45.189
Exactly. That is

111
00:24:49.369 --> 00:24:51.270
no. Yeah.

112
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.800
And I know it's

113
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.910
it for a kid

114
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.930
except for a heart.

115
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.020
Mhm

116
00:25:47.329 --> 00:25:51.319
When I was back at the university, uh something happened and I had no money to pay for my next

117
00:25:51.329 --> 00:25:56.359
semester. I prayed and cried for a long time until God just told me go back to the school. I went

118
00:25:56.369 --> 00:26:02.400
back, I talked to my supervisor and miraculously, he gave me a full scholarship and that's how God

119
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.380
saved me in this place.

120
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:12.839
So we're in this series called Turning Point. And we're gonna be looking at specific stories in the

121
00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:18.989
Bible, but also hearing from specific people in our own community that have experienced turning

122
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.329
points uh where God came through for them in a big way. I believe that the stories in the Bible are

123
00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:31.579
filled with wisdom that we can then take and apply in our own lives. And I think that if there was

124
00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:40.920
something that God wanted to communicate to you, if that difference in your life could turn things

125
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:49.579
around, wouldn't you want to know what it is? If it could just do everything for you in the moment

126
00:26:49.589 --> 00:26:56.089
that you would need it most. Isn't that something you just want to put into practice? I feel like so

127
00:26:56.099 --> 00:27:03.760
many times God is speaking to us about what can really create those turning points for us. But we

128
00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.920
aren't always ready in the moment that that wisdom comes to us. There's a challenge there for each

129
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:16.140
of us today to hear what God is saying in the story. And we're gonna take the principles out of that

130
00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:23.890
story and apply them into our own everyday life. But we're also going to listen intently for what

131
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:32.290
God would want us to identify as our turning point. And so today, we're talking about how the

132
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:40.189
principle is the promise. Now, many of us are in a place where we have decisions that we need to

133
00:27:40.199 --> 00:27:46.800
make. Sometimes those decisions are not as big as others and sometimes they're not as pivotal as we

134
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:53.739
would imagine or envision them to be. I remember one time I had accepted an invitation to be a

135
00:27:53.750 --> 00:28:01.630
speaker for a young adult retreat. And it was at that young adult retreat that I had been invited to,

136
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:09.469
that we were able to do some skiing. But at the same time, also spend some time in the word. And at

137
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:17.119
this retreat, there were several people there and um I knew some and didn't know others and it gave

138
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:23.150
me the opportunity to just share that weekend what God had put on my heart. I had gone there with a

139
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:29.189
very clear intention and that was to, to teach and to be used by God and to be of an encouragement

140
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:37.760
to young adults who were often neglected in churches, they didn't find a place or a space for them

141
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:47.089
to gather. And so that was the intent of this retreat. And so as I went there, I had every intention

142
00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:54.510
to just stay focused on the Lord. But as these things sometimes play out, I was single at the time

143
00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:03.790
and I was also looking for a wife. And when I was at this retreat, speaking, I would never have

144
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:10.530
imagined that the person that I would later marry would be at this retreat. In fact, I just kept my

145
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:18.069
focus on what I had to do and, and the retreat ended. And at the end of that retreat, this person

146
00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:22.839
started attending the church that I was at. And then they started volunteering and as they were

147
00:29:22.849 --> 00:29:27.800
volunteering, I became friends with them. And then over the course of three years, I started to

148
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:35.030
realize that God had led this person into my life to be more than just a volunteer and more than

149
00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:42.900
just a member of the community. He had led her there to be my wife. That's Michelle. So

150
00:29:47.589 --> 00:29:56.390
that's where it really started for us. I didn't think that was what was going to happen. I wasn't

151
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:04.290
planning it, I wasn't prepared for it, but that's where it started. And I sometimes wonder like how

152
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:12.469
prepared are we for what God is trying to bring into our life? And it made me think of a story and

153
00:30:12.479 --> 00:30:19.130
the story was a beautiful one. And because Abraham was at the end of his life and he was struggling,

154
00:30:20.959 --> 00:30:28.849
he was struggling because he looked at his son and he saw that he was gonna leave him. And the one

155
00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:36.969
who had been given to him as the fulfillment of his promise, he saw him as not being able to

156
00:30:36.979 --> 00:30:45.599
experience all the promises that God would have for him. And so he calls his most trusted employee,

157
00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:56.770
the scriptures, called them servants. But he was the one who was in charge of all of his affairs. He

158
00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:06.349
believed in this man and trusted him with his life and he brings him into the room. And as he finds

159
00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:12.359
himself having this conversation, heart to heart, he's telling him about his son Isaac and how

160
00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:23.939
worried he is that he hasn't yet found the person that he is to marry. And he's worried about where

161
00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:30.739
they live, the choices that are available to them. He's worried about the choice that his son is

162
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:37.880
going to make and, and he's worried about what would happen to the promise. And so when he speaks to

163
00:31:39.579 --> 00:31:49.699
this friend, he says, I want you to take your hand and I want you to put it underneath my thigh. And

164
00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:58.079
as he put his hand there, he says, I want you to make a vow. And the vow that I want you to make is

165
00:31:58.089 --> 00:32:08.760
one where you promise that you and I were in agreement that we now make this covenant and that it

166
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:19.130
cannot and will not be broken. And so he does exactly that and he makes this promise. And the first

167
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:25.040
thing that we notice that when we're in this position in life where we're vulnerable, but we see

168
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:31.099
people that are vulnerable when we see that their lives are unfulfilled, when we look at ourselves,

169
00:32:31.109 --> 00:32:38.000
and we say that we feel unfulfilled and incomplete in one manner or another. The first thing we need

170
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:48.089
to ask ourselves is who are we surrounded by and who's in our life to help us succeed? I think all

171
00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:56.109
of us understand the role of and the importance of mentorship. I, I we we see this all the time

172
00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:03.310
these days, you, you have to pay to have mentorship, you have to pay to get resources. I mean, the

173
00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:08.260
first one is free, but everything after that you're gonna have to pay for these days if you want to

174
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:13.199
know how to take your next step. Well, you're gonna have to follow the right person because they

175
00:33:13.209 --> 00:33:18.780
seem to have all the answers and, and, and what they're doing in essence is enriching themselves,

176
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:27.069
having taken the answers from somebody else and repurposing them so that you can buy into what

177
00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:32.869
they're promising so that you can have the mentorship that you need to succeed. I feel like

178
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:39.400
sometimes we're missing out on the most important type of membership, the kind of mentorship that

179
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:45.780
revolutionizes the way that we are now going to see the world. And that is a spiritual mentorship. I

180
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:54.719
don't know about you. But I know that in my life, I can only succeed as far as the spiritual

181
00:33:54.729 --> 00:34:04.670
mentorship I have, I, I can't reach the next level and I can't put into practice the next principle

182
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:15.280
and I can't fulfill my purpose or live according to his promises unless I have the right spiritual

183
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:23.129
mentorship in my life. And what Abraham does is that he turns to his friend and he says, you're my

184
00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:31.429
trusted friend, you're my employee, you're in charge of all my affairs. So for me to put my son

185
00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:39.590
under your care is an extension of that. And so what we discover is that Isaac was surrounded to

186
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:46.070
succeed by family and friends. And sometimes we don't have that in our lives. I think that if we

187
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:52.179
were to ask everybody in the room, we'd wonder if all of us have that. I mean, who is really

188
00:34:52.189 --> 00:35:00.770
surrounding you and surrounding us to make sure that we succeeded. Well, Isaac had Abraham and his

189
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:08.889
trusted employee in Genesis in chapter 24 verse four, it says that Abraham was now a very old man

190
00:35:08.899 --> 00:35:15.830
and the Lord had blessed him in every way. And one day Abraham said to his oldest servant, the man

191
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:25.159
in charge of his household, take an oath by putting your hand under my thigh. I have two teenage

192
00:35:25.169 --> 00:35:30.010
kids. I guess they're young adults now. Uh, I like to still think they're immature. So I call them

193
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:39.270
teenagers. Uh, that's not fair but it's sometimes true. Um, they're amazing. I love them but I worry

194
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.520
about them. I worry about the choices they're gonna make. I worry about who they're going to choose.

195
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.850
I worry about the life they're gonna try to build even now as they're still studying and figuring

196
00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.979
things out. I worry

197
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.780
and I wonder how many people in this room are doing the exact same thing if your parents,

198
00:36:07.959 --> 00:36:13.699
I, I wonder, do you have alignment with your partner or your spouse with the person that you do life

199
00:36:13.709 --> 00:36:23.969
with the person that God has given you? Do you have a covenant that you have made between you where

200
00:36:23.979 --> 00:36:35.209
your convictions are never going to allow you to become complacent towards that, which is the only

201
00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:40.060
compatibility that matters most for your Children.

202
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.250
You see when you have that you, you can look each other in the eye and say, we're not going to

203
00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.820
accept this outcome.

204
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:58.830
We're gonna pray for something else. We're going to believe in something else but not this.

205
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:06.439
You and I, we're in agreement. We've made a covenant before God and now we're making one to each

206
00:37:06.449 --> 00:37:16.169
other that this is not going to be how things are going to turn out for them. And we are going to

207
00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:24.540
have to pray even harder than we've ever prayed to make sure that God is the one who's doing the

208
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:32.300
choosing, who's helping them make the decisions. And, and when you have someone in your life like

209
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:40.429
that life can be easy. But it's, it's harder when you don't, it's obviously clear that sometimes you

210
00:37:40.439 --> 00:37:47.429
want that but you don't have it. And so you need to pray that someone brings people into your life

211
00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:53.229
so that you can have, that doesn't have to be a person that you share a bed with. But it has to be

212
00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:59.530
someone that you can bring into your life and share coffee with and, and tea with and sit with and

213
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:07.100
pour out your heart with and allow that person to surround you so that you can succeed so that you

214
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.659
can be in agreement. Because the Bible tells us and reminds us that there's always power in

215
00:38:12.669 --> 00:38:18.209
agreement. That's why he says when two or three are gathered in my name, I'm gonna be in their midst.

216
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:31.100
He's looking for us to look for others that we can gather and be in covenant with over a situation

217
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:37.629
so that we can see success. Where is it that you need this in your life? Maybe it's in a

218
00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:44.189
relationship. Maybe you've been choosing on your own and you've been experiencing the heartache that

219
00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:51.000
comes with that and you look at your situation and you say I've, I've always made this choice. I've,

220
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:58.649
I've always been led by my preference. I've been taking the opportunity that was in front of me, but

221
00:38:58.659 --> 00:39:06.330
I haven't really given this entirely over to God. So what God is saying, maybe you need to now

222
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.459
surround yourself with family and friends, people who are gonna make a covenant, people who are

223
00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:18.030
gonna pray for you. People who are gonna make sure that you are preserved by the wrong choice so

224
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.169
that you can make the right one. Can we say amen to that

225
00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:30.989
bring people into your life that can do that? Here's another principle, the principle was upheld

226
00:39:33.409 --> 00:39:41.479
by those who upheld Isaac. And I think sometimes we lose sight of how important this is. It. It's

227
00:39:41.489 --> 00:39:46.959
not that you're just upholding a person. I think there's a lot of people who care about us. But what

228
00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:56.290
we want is for them to uphold the principle first before they can uphold us. Because if it's the

229
00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:03.129
other way around, then you have someone who loves you more than the principal, more than the word of

230
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:11.229
God, more than His standard. And what that means is that when something comes into your life,

231
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.320
they're going to compromise right along with you

232
00:40:16.959 --> 00:40:25.699
because they have put you above the principle. I want someone to love me, but I want them to love

233
00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:36.010
God more. I want them to want the best for me, but I want them to give me God's best more. I want

234
00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:44.209
them to remind me of what God's best is so that I stop compromising and keep living out the

235
00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:51.090
heartbreak that I'm experiencing over and over again. And if I don't have that person in my life,

236
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:58.610
then I'm just going to keep making the same kind of decisions, the same, different at times. Exactly

237
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:05.379
the same kind of choices, maybe looking different, but they're always the same because they're

238
00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:13.469
always soaked and compromisable. And so in Genesis chapter 24 and in verse three, it says, swear by

239
00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:19.590
the Lord, the God of heaven and earth that you will not allow my son to marry one of these local

240
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.909
Canaanite women. I feel bad for the Canaanites. I feel bad for their women too now in this story.

241
00:41:24.919 --> 00:41:33.300
But what Abraham was saying is that if he married one of the Canaanites, it was going to change

242
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:42.879
his devotion to God. And it doesn't take much for our devotion to be shifted and to be affected. I

243
00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:51.469
mean, we, we do that all along and all alone without a whole lot of temptation in doing it. It, it's

244
00:41:51.479 --> 00:41:58.530
a constant decision on our part to always be devoted to God and to his principles. Imagine if you

245
00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.439
have someone that you're doing life with, who doesn't even care about those things and pulls you in

246
00:42:03.449 --> 00:42:11.100
a different direction altogether. It's already hard and now it's gotten impossible. And so what God

247
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:17.209
says is like, why do you want your life to be like that? And, and, and he says, I know that God has

248
00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:24.060
given me a promise. Abraham says, but the only way this promise happens is if Isaac is protected.

249
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:33.239
And so God wants us to inherit the promise, but he knows that he has to protect the promise. And we

250
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:44.969
have to make sure that the principal isn't just upheld, but that we are too in the same way so that

251
00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:49.330
God can give us the promise. Here's the third thing,

252
00:42:51.929 --> 00:42:56.590
the principle didn't have to change, but the location did.

253
00:42:59.179 --> 00:43:04.899
And so what happened is that Abraham realized that that it wasn't gonna be someone for him to marry

254
00:43:05.389 --> 00:43:12.649
that was gonna keep him in the same faith devoted to the same God. And so he's like, the principle

255
00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:16.429
doesn't have to change. And I hear this from people all the time. We live in Quebec. There's no

256
00:43:16.439 --> 00:43:17.860
Christians here as it is

257
00:43:21.129 --> 00:43:24.419
even on dating apps when they write Christian, who knows what kind

258
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.379
I get it. It's hard. I'm not saying it's easy. I mean, you know, if we were somewhere else, this

259
00:43:33.389 --> 00:43:37.290
church would be filled probably in the multiple hundreds and thousands, I get it. But we're in

260
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:44.949
Quebec. This is where we are. But do you think that that God is, is, is held back by, by geography?

261
00:43:46.929 --> 00:43:57.659
He's held back by quantity. He's not. The story reminds us that now Abraham is telling Isaac, I want

262
00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:03.800
you to take a trip and I want you to go back to the place where we're from. And I want you to find a

263
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:10.100
woman who will love God there because the I don't want him marrying someone from here because that's

264
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:18.280
not gonna help fulfill the promise, it's gonna take him away from his purpose. And so the principle

265
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:26.110
never changed, but the location did. And so what I know is that God is able to fulfill His promise

266
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:34.179
to you, but it doesn't have to be in this city. See, he's able to take you out of the city just like

267
00:44:34.189 --> 00:44:37.919
he's able to send someone to another city

268
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:48.409
and get them to make the choice somewhere else. So you can be introduced in the story that we're in.

269
00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:58.120
God is saying the principle stays the same, but the location can change because this world, all of

270
00:44:58.129 --> 00:45:06.159
it, it belongs to me. And I have someone that is better than anyone that you can choose if you just

271
00:45:06.169 --> 00:45:14.909
keep breaking my principles. And so I want to give you someone, if you will uphold my principles.

272
00:45:14.919 --> 00:45:22.209
Don't worry about the location because I can bring that person into your life. And so in Genesis 24

273
00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:28.870
4, he says go instead to my homeland. I want you to go to my relatives and I want you to find a wife

274
00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:38.659
there for my son Isaac. And so he tells him where to go. Now the servant is, is upset. He's worried,

275
00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:43.669
he's, he's panicking a bit. He's like, I don't know if I can do this. This is a huge responsibility.

276
00:45:43.739 --> 00:45:50.310
What if the girl doesn't want to leave? It's one of his concerns. He's like, how am I gonna find her?

277
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:57.370
So he's really trusting God in all of this. He, he knows that he has a responsibility there and, and

278
00:45:57.379 --> 00:46:04.750
I like that because the responsibility is in Isaacs. If you notice the responsibility in the story

279
00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.919
belongs to those that made the covenant.

280
00:46:09.659 --> 00:46:17.889
And, and this is important because the covenant was made by Abraham and his servant for Isaac. And I

281
00:46:17.899 --> 00:46:25.389
want you to see the importance of having spiritual authority over your life and the blessing that

282
00:46:25.399 --> 00:46:32.350
that can bring you when you commit yourself to the principle God will bring you the person.

283
00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:38.030
You guys don't seem convinced at all.

284
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.449
I I'm just feeling and sensing so much doubt

285
00:46:46.479 --> 00:46:53.409
like the story is not enough, these points aren't strong enough. You have all these reasons why this

286
00:46:53.419 --> 00:46:56.850
is not gonna work. Ok?

287
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.409
But here's what I know

288
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:08.830
this is what it looks like to put your full faith in God.

289
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:19.320
If you want to put it in yourself, you can just keep going, do what you've been doing up until now.

290
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:26.270
But if you're looking for a turning point, that how about we do things a little different this time,

291
00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:36.699
see, the principle was upheld, not to jeopardize the promise.

292
00:47:38.879 --> 00:47:49.610
There's a beautiful verse in, in Genesis 24 7 and it says this for the Lord, the God of heaven who

293
00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:56.629
took me from my father's house and my native land, he solemnly promised to give this land to my

294
00:47:56.639 --> 00:48:03.199
descendants and he will send his angel ahead of you and he will see to it that you find a wife there

295
00:48:03.429 --> 00:48:10.669
for my son. Look how much faith Abraham has. And then he says, and if she is unwilling to come back

296
00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:16.949
with you, then you are free from this oath of mine. But under no circumstance, look at this. Are you

297
00:48:16.959 --> 00:48:25.620
to take my son there? Now, let's say you find somebody, Abraham is saying, we don't go backwards. We

298
00:48:25.629 --> 00:48:30.330
only go forward. The only reason I'm sending you there is because there's a woman of God there for

299
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:35.379
my son. That's the woman he's gonna marry and they're going to fulfill this promise together. But

300
00:48:35.389 --> 00:48:39.280
here's the problem. If Isaac goes back,

301
00:48:41.939 --> 00:48:48.620
then everything that I did to get to this point was for nothing because God told me to leave that

302
00:48:48.629 --> 00:49:00.310
land for a new land. It so not Isaac can't go back. I hate it when our households dedicate ourselves

303
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:07.129
to the Lord and we pledge and promise ourselves to follow him and to serve him. And then our

304
00:49:07.139 --> 00:49:11.790
Children go back into the world. Anybody else, it's not heartbreaking

305
00:49:13.879 --> 00:49:20.419
all the sacrifices, the devotion, the dedication, the instruction, just the teaching, everything,

306
00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:26.080
just everything that we did, everything we poured into them just to see them, just turn away and to

307
00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:26.919
walk away from it.

308
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:37.699
And I need you to understand that, that that's what happens when we allow the principles to be

309
00:49:37.709 --> 00:49:46.129
corrupted, to be compromised. But if we uphold the principle, here's what happens, God can always

310
00:49:46.139 --> 00:49:54.590
fulfill the promise. And so what Abraham does is He says, I never want them to go back. I, I don't

311
00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:02.820
want Isaac to go back. I, I don't want her to pull him there. I want the promise that God has given

312
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:10.199
us to go forward from here and He knows exactly how that's going to happen. And so he says, you make

313
00:50:10.209 --> 00:50:16.729
sure that whoever it is that you find whoever it is, that God shows you whoever it is that God puts

314
00:50:16.739 --> 00:50:26.979
in front of you in no way. And under no circumstances are you to take my son back there. And that's

315
00:50:26.989 --> 00:50:27.610
why

316
00:50:30.429 --> 00:50:35.250
I love this. Isaac isn't allowed to go with the servant

317
00:50:41.129 --> 00:50:47.409
because Isaac is the promise. Isaac is the future.

318
00:50:50.939 --> 00:50:58.060
Isaac doesn't go back. Isaac only goes forward, can we say amen to that? He only goes far.

319
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:07.379
And when I think about the life that God has given you, he's, he's tired of us going back back to

320
00:51:07.389 --> 00:51:11.830
the old choices, the old ways, the old patterns, the old habits, the old things, the old

321
00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:19.510
relationships, that different face, same outcome. You know what I'm saying? He's, he's looking for

322
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:28.850
us to uphold a principle and to be upheld by people who believe in the same principle who are going

323
00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:38.070
to help us hold out for his promise instead of compromising and accepting that, which is the poorest

324
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:44.310
decision for us in the moment that looks like there's nothing else to choose from.

325
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:55.209
The principle didn't change, but the location had to and that's OK. And God knows where to direct us

326
00:51:55.850 --> 00:52:04.830
so that we can fulfill that promise. Trust Him for that, believe in God for that. Because you see

327
00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:17.149
this story tells us that the commitment to the convictions is what created the consensus for the

328
00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:26.199
compatibility to become evident. Because when the servant sees someone come forward, she, he asks

329
00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:32.209
her for some water and then she says, I'm not gonna just give you water a good source. She says, I'm

330
00:52:32.219 --> 00:52:38.800
going to give water to your camels. And the scripture says that he went there with 10 camels. I

331
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.860
don't know how much camels drink, but those things look thirsty.

332
00:52:44.489 --> 00:52:49.239
So if I was her, I would have said I'm gonna give you water. But then for the camels, you're on your

333
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.379
own. Anybody else?

334
00:52:52.399 --> 00:52:58.310
Well, she does the opposite. She, she looks at the guy and he says, I'm not gonna just give you

335
00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:05.340
water, but I'm gonna give all of your 10 camels water to drink. And I kind of looked this up and did

336
00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:13.169
some research and it turns out that it's about 10 gallons of water per camel. And, and that means

337
00:53:13.179 --> 00:53:21.610
that Rachel would have to have gone into the well bucket by bucket by bucket by bucket by bucket

338
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:25.250
until they had all been satisfied.

339
00:53:30.629 --> 00:53:36.320
The servant looks at this and he says, it's got to be her. Who else could it be? Nobody else would

340
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:44.229
go through all this trouble. And so he continues to ask questions and in his asking of questions, he

341
00:53:44.239 --> 00:53:49.840
begins to understand that that God is directing and there's a moment that's so beautiful. He just

342
00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:57.840
falls to his knees and he begins to worship God because he knows that God has fulfilled the covenant

343
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:05.780
between Him and Abraham. And he's provided a woman who is not just a hard worker, but someone who is

344
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:11.979
willing to leave and go with him on a journey back to a man she's never met

345
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.620
and they become the fulfillment of God's promise.

346
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:31.139
You know, when you see those videos in those expressions where it's kind of funny where they say

347
00:54:31.149 --> 00:54:34.739
they understood the assignment. You know what I'm talking about?

348
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:44.850
Well, I love the fact that this man in Abraham understood the assignment. They never deviated from

349
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:53.709
it. Not once because God was always the one choosing. II, I look at this and it looks like it's

350
00:54:53.719 --> 00:54:58.560
Abraham who's choosing, I look at this and I see it's the servant who's choosing. It's, it's, it's

351
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:07.689
Rachel who chooses. Yeah, they all have choices. But the one that they are all turning to and

352
00:55:07.699 --> 00:55:17.360
dependent on making the choice is God. See, that's what's different. You see, we always get to

353
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:26.179
choose. There's never a time where you're not able to choose. But what we wanna do is we wanna say,

354
00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:30.300
God, I want you to choose before I get to.

355
00:55:32.679 --> 00:55:41.909
I don't want my choice to preempt yours. I want you to choose and for my choice to follow your

356
00:55:41.919 --> 00:55:42.439
choosing.

357
00:55:44.709 --> 00:55:48.260
You see, there's three points that we need to remember when we're making decisions.

358
00:55:50.659 --> 00:55:54.639
And I'm putting this up here because I know there's some people who are already married. So you're

359
00:55:54.649 --> 00:56:00.520
kind of stuck because you made your choice. So I need to tell you something. So you can just like

360
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:05.149
leave here a little encouraged and say at least the message is a little bit for me. So here, here

361
00:56:05.159 --> 00:56:11.320
are the three points that can apply to decision making in general. Are you ready? Are you still with

362
00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:18.439
me? OK. So here's the first one and it's good for any situation. I want you to surround yourself

363
00:56:18.449 --> 00:56:26.919
with people who are going to uphold God's principles and uphold you. And it's got to be in that

364
00:56:26.929 --> 00:56:32.699
order. They're going to uphold God's principles and they're going to uphold you. So who are you

365
00:56:32.709 --> 00:56:38.439
gonna look for? You're gonna look for people who are devoted and dedicated to the, to, to the God of

366
00:56:38.449 --> 00:56:46.639
His word. And those are the people that you want in your life. The second thing is you don't disobey

367
00:56:46.649 --> 00:56:50.939
God's principles to achieve your own purposes.

368
00:56:52.949 --> 00:56:57.419
And if your purpose is to get married, you're going to do that. If your purpose is to shack up with

369
00:56:57.429 --> 00:57:02.320
someone, you're going to shack up, purpose is to have a child, you're gonna have a child. Purpose is

370
00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:07.020
to adopt a child. You can do that too. Whatever your purpose is, you're going to be able to do

371
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:11.449
anything that you want in this life, you have the freedom to be able to do it, make your choices,

372
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:20.100
live with them. That's how it works. I get it, but don't disobey God's principles to achieve your

373
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:27.909
own purposes, do things his way and then experience his promise his way,

374
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:35.429
do things your way and then experience what comes from that.

375
00:57:37.929 --> 00:57:46.469
But God has something so much better for you. You ready for the third one with every choice you're

376
00:57:46.479 --> 00:57:50.909
making, you have already entrusted the choice to God.

377
00:57:54.580 --> 00:58:00.709
So before you even choose, you've already given this to God before there's even a choice to make.

378
00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:06.389
You've already told God that you don't want the wrong choice. You don't want to make a mistake in

379
00:58:06.399 --> 00:58:13.780
the choosing. You want God to choose so that you can just choose what He is already blessed, what he

380
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:20.800
has already approved, what, what is already going to fulfill the promise? You see, if we do these

381
00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:30.560
things and we apply this in our lives, we will always experience a turning point. Our life will

382
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:35.810
never be the same if we do this now, it's up to you. But God to the test

383
00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:44.639
challenge, God say God, I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna let this be my turning point. I'm gonna obey

384
00:58:44.649 --> 00:58:52.530
you. I'm gonna uphold your principles so that I can experience your promise. Not my way with yours.

385
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:54.860
God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

386
00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:07.879
Just gonna ask the worship team to come up and we're gonna do the gathering a little different going

387
00:59:07.889 --> 00:59:13.000
forward. So we're gonna have a song we're gonna worship. And at the end of that song, we're gonna do

388
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:17.399
the announcements at the end now. So just stick around for those and I'll share them at the end

389
00:59:17.689 --> 00:59:24.929
after the song is uh is over. But I want us to, to really give our lives to the Lord in this moment

390
00:59:24.939 --> 00:59:32.729
and to say, Lord, I, I hear what you had to say. I, I look at the story and, and I, and I think God

391
00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:40.110
there's gotta be something here for me. II, I pray that you would give God that opportunity to

392
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:48.159
reveal himself powerfully to you today. And here's a moment for us to make this a turning point.

393
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:57.330
Father, I pray that you would help us to become persons and people

394
01:00:00.149 --> 01:00:01.120
of principle

395
01:00:03.479 --> 01:00:12.100
that we would enter into covenants with people that want to uphold your principles so that we can

396
01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:20.479
experience the fulfillment of your promise. Thank you that you are not allowing us to be lost

397
01:00:20.489 --> 01:00:23.659
according to the patterns of this world.

398
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:33.600
But you are shining your light brightly on the path that we are on ordering our steps so that we can

399
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:40.840
experience the fulfillment of your blessing. I pray for your blessing to be upon each person here

400
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:47.489
today, the lives that they represent the things that you are doing already for them, things that

401
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:54.550
you're protecting them from and, and even the things that you're about to bring into their life. I

402
01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:02.370
pray Lord that they would experience the fullness of your promise. We ask these things in jesus'

403
01:01:02.379 --> 01:01:11.459
name. Amen. Amen. Could you stand as we would just sing with, with this team on stage and as they

404
01:01:11.469 --> 01:01:16.020
would lead us into this next powerful song that gives us an opportunity to just connect with the

405
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:19.379
Lord. And I'll be back after that. Thank you so much

406
01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:33.189
and sing the song to our Lord and just telling him that he is our everything so that we may think of

407
01:01:33.199 --> 01:01:40.820
him and let him be who we believe in to make our choices in our life. Thank you.

408
01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:50.979
Let's say you are my everything. You are my

409
01:01:53.169 --> 01:01:58.290

410
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:09.459

Oh my hope. Um

On my home.

Oh my hope.

you,

01:06:09.679 --> 01:06:17.719
You may be seated for the announcements. Wow, perfect song for a perfect ending. Well, we just want

428
01:06:17.729 --> 01:06:22.699
to share some quick announcements before you guys head out today. Um The first one is that next

429
01:06:22.709 --> 01:06:28.199
Sunday is our community kitchen meal and it's going to be happening right after the gathering. And

430
01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:34.830
so if there's anyone that you know, that can also benefit from community and a meal and a

431
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.929
distribution of both food and clothing, then you can also let them know they can join us for the

432
01:06:39.939 --> 01:06:45.629
gathering at 10 30 or they can come afterwards at 12 o'clock when the meal will be served. It's open

433
01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:51.449
to everyone and we hope that it's an opportunity for us to just connect around food as well as we

434
01:06:51.459 --> 01:06:57.969
continue to make progress on our basement as we continue to pray that we get all the supplies and

435
01:06:57.979 --> 01:07:02.949
all the equipment that we need and, and that the washrooms can get up and running and all those

436
01:07:02.959 --> 01:07:08.449
things that are still missing. But we've taken such incredible strides in the last couple of years.

437
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:14.580
Uh God has blessed us abundantly. We're seeing it week to week and we're so glad that we've gotten

438
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:20.439
this far because we believe in a God is gonna take us the rest of the way. And so let's, let's

439
01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:27.399
praise God for that. And then we have a guys and girls event. So guys is our men's ministry, girls

440
01:07:27.409 --> 01:07:33.659
is our women's ministry. And while we have separate events, we also have a combined event and we're

441
01:07:33.669 --> 01:07:40.949
gonna do it on Friday, September the 29th. And, um, we're gonna encourage you guys to, um, come out

442
01:07:40.959 --> 01:07:48.090
for that and you know how, uh, fun bowling can be because you can truly not be good at this and

443
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:54.929
still have fun. And, uh, and it's gonna be more about just hanging out and you know how you're

444
01:07:54.939 --> 01:07:59.750
waiting for someone to do their turn. Well, it gives you an opportunity to talk to someone and after

445
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:12.909
today's message, you may want to really consider that where you meet the one could be at LA lane. So

446
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:24.209
we'll see, we'll see. But there's another opportunity. Um, if you're single or coupled up already,

447
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:30.149
then there's a retreat that's coming up. It's called the Pulse retreat. And it's actually for ages

448
01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:38.000
35 to 55. Now, one of the things that we've done at River's Edge is had a heart and a desire to

449
01:08:38.009 --> 01:08:45.339
include everyone and what we're doing is that we're also putting on city wide events so that we can

450
01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:53.520
get people from other churches to also participate. So this isn't just for our community. It's also

451
01:08:53.529 --> 01:09:00.049
open to every other community as well. And so we have sent out invitations and so we're gonna be

452
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:06.588
able to provide more information to you um in the weeks to come. But for now, we just want to let

453
01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:13.318
you know that this retreat is happening in November. It's gonna be at Parkside Ranch and it's gonna

454
01:09:13.329 --> 01:09:20.529
be for ages 35 to 55. Well, we have four ways that you can give even at the end of this gathering,

455
01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:26.189

456
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.370
