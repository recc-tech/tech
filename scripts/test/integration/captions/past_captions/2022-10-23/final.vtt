00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:48.710
it was there also in the last, last week, but we had the privilege to here even, but this week, our

14
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:55.880
pastor Lorenzo is back. So let's stand together right now and get ourselves prepared to clap our

15
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.450
hands a little bit just to generate some heat even if it's already hot in here. But just please

16
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.600
welcome with me or worship team with our first song forever.

17
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.100
We're gonna start this song with a lot of "oh"s. Let's

18
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.030
sing this all together. Beautiful song about forever.

61
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:20.460
Wow! You may be seated. A wonderful gathering that has been prepared for us this morning. So let's

62
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.780
start with the first announcement with Unite the Church. Unite the Church is an event that's going to

63
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:34.530
be the first event organized by our dear Nathan and a lot of people from other churches will be

64
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.850
invited to that event. So it's not an event only for, for River's Edge members. It's really for

65
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:47.220
everyone in any churches that want to praise God together. So that's the event, November 11, mark

66
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:53.990
your calendar for that night of worship altogether. So no matter where or which church were

67
00:22:53.990 --> 00:23:01.120
belonging altogether for worshiping that one God. So a wonderful idea. And can't wait to see the

68
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:07.210
results of that first evening. Also, I've been, I've been, no, I've been informed that it will be

74
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:55.380
gonna be our fall fest in the notes. They're saying that the children could be these guys and come

75
00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:04.760
here. But what about the adults being these guys as well. Okay, so, so next Sunday fall fest, don't

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:18.860
events. So make sure you don't miss that. And again, for those who are looking, uh, watching us from

78
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:27.830
home. Uh, please consider being with us for that fall fest October 30th community kitchen. Uh, let's

79
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:36.870
continue to spread the word about the community kitchen reopening. So there's there we have all of

80
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:45.290
you this morning. It's really uh, oof... They're...

81
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.770
Il y a eu déjà plusieurs événements dans les dernières semaines.

82
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:56.490
So voilà, that's what I wanted to see. And uh, so there will be another events also in a couple of weeks. So

83
00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:02.890
please continue to pray and support that ministry and make sure also everybody is informed about the,

84
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:10.280
about the beginning of that ministry for ways to give that's really super important. But there's

85
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.660
good news about the giving and the financial support that you're giving first. Obviously, we always

86
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:21.800
want to thank anybody that is supporting us financially, but to thank also everybody that are

87
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:27.670
serving that community in different ways. So there's a lot of you that are involved, some of you

88
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:33.980
that are involved with the kids also with the after party there, the community kitchen that we just

89
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:41.130
talked about. So there's many way to serve the community so we can serve with our gift and the

90
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:46.810
talent that we have, but we can serve also and support the church financially. So, for those of you

91
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:52.510
also are supporting that church financially. We want to thank you and we thank everybody that is

92
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:58.260
helping that church. Just to be aware, also that we're going to close our financial years, things

93
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:05.690
are going honestly, we're a little bit behind. But it's good, we've been in really bad places in the

94
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:12.470
past, but not bad places, but tough, tough situation in the past at that moment in the year, but

95
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:18.660
we're a lot closer than we have been previously. So that's really big thanks to you and please

96
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:25.600
continue to give faithfully and to be able to transition to that new year with a strong financial

97
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.690
position. So I just want to thank you for everything you've done so far, by the way. Okay,

98
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:43.340
I'm really serious about that. That's really something that when we have that strong position, it's

99
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.520
really helpful to be able to concentrate our efforts on everything else that is happening in that

100
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:56.200
community. So thanks everyone also. So, uh, just one last announcement, it's the tricks of the week.

101
00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:03.040
So l'astuce de la semaine. So let's watch that short video from someone that is really looking like

102
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.300
me. So let's...

103
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.780
Bonne fin de semaine, bye bye.

104
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:15.780
So yeah, so I have a twin who is a bit of a bizarre guy. So anyways, that's the reason why I don't talk that

105
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:21.660
much often about that guy. But for those of you who haven't listened, who don't understand well, what

106
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:28.100
he was saying basically is encouraging everyone to really use your pool for the last time, because

107
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:36.090
when they're gonna be ice, it's a little bit tougher to use your pool. So it was 52 uh degree. So at

108
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:42.950
that time. So yeah, really interesting. So if you have a hard problem, don't try this. Okay, unless

109
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:51.110
you really want to go see Jesus quickly. Okay, talking about seeing Jesus, it's time for dismissing

110
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:56.700
the kids. So kids, there's a wonderful program prepared for you. So let's look at that quick

111
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.500
video while our pastor Lorenzo is coming. Thanks.

112
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:08.110
Awesome. Everybody. So kids and youth today, you're dismissed. So if there's any youth hanging out

113
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:14.510
here and you wanted to go to the annex, we've got a great program there for you as well. So, youth

114
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.560
and kids, if you could just make your way over to the check in, that'd be amazing. And uh as they

115
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:27.210
just get the microphone regulated, we'll be able to continue. We're in our fresh start series and

116
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:33.990
I'm sure you enjoyed the ministry of both johann while I was in L. A. And then pastor, even last

117
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:42.730
Sunday I was with you as well to be able to take in those messages. I watched uh pastor Evans

118
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:51.360
message uh live with you and then watched on video the message that was also given by uh johan and

119
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:58.330
what a beautiful uh couple of Sundays we had in hearing their voice and their contribution to this

120
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:04.610
fresh start series. And today we're gonna be talking about that as well as we talk specifically

121
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:12.480
about the topic of on retribution. And so we're gonna keep working on that. If you guys want me to

122
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:21.900
hold the mic instead, I can do that as well. And there's no point starting until we get that fixed.

123
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:31.230
Otherwise you'll just think it's God speaking to you somehow. You can be all confused more than me

124
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.240
already are.

125
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:43.020
It's already hard enough to figure it out most days. You don't need to make it harder. Um But one of

126
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.280
the things that we definitely want to make sure that we do together as a community of faith is just

127
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:53.210
understand that when we do revisit the past, it's not something new that God is asking us to

128
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:57.990
accomplish or to do for the very first time. It's something that has been done over and over again

129
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.330
in the scriptures And in fact the story that we're going to be looking at today um is definitely

130
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:11.570
about revisiting uh emotions that can be sometimes very difficult and challenging to overcome. And

131
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:18.260
we're gonna take a look at this story and we're gonna read from chapter one verse one in the book of

132
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.530
Jonah. Let's take a look at this passage together. And it says that the Lord gave this message to

133
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:32.020
Jonah who is the son of Amitai and it said get up and go to the great city of Nineveh announce my

134
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:41.730
judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are. But Jonah got up and instead of

135
00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:49.140
listening to the direction of God he went in the opposite direction to get away from the Lord and

136
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:56.690
what he had asked of him. And so then he went down to the ports of Joppa where he found a ship that

137
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:04.670
was leaving for Tarsus and he bought a ticket and he went on board hoping to escape from the Lord by

138
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:18.420
sailing to Tarsus. But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea and it caused a violent storm

139
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:26.380
that threatened to break the ship apart, fearing for their lives. The desperate soldiers uh sailor,

140
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:33.580
excuse me, shouted to their gods for help and they threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship.

141
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:41.980
But all this time Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold. And so the captain went down after him

142
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:51.340
and he says how can you sleep at a time like this? He shouted, Get up and pray to your God, maybe he

143
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:58.950
will pay attention to us and he will spare our lives. And then the crew cast lots to see which of

144
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:06.520
them had offended the gods and then caused this terrible storm. And when they did this the lots

145
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:15.610
identified Jonah as the culprit, Why has this awful storm come down on us? They demanded, who are

146
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:23.890
you? What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality? And then Jonah

147
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:32.260
answered, I am a hebrew and I worship the Lord the God of heaven. Who made the sea and the land. And

148
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:37.580
then the sailors, they were terrified when they heard this for he had already told them that he was

149
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:47.690
running away from the Lord or why did you do it? They groaned. And since the storm was getting worse

150
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:59.670
all the time, they asked him what should we do to you to stop this storm? And he said throw me into

151
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:08.260
the sea and it will become calm again. I know that this terrible storm is all my fault and instead

152
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:16.210
the sailor's rowed even harder to get the ship to the land. But the stormy sea was too violent for

153
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:24.150
them and they couldn't make it. And then they cried out to the Lord, Jonah's God, oh Lord! They

154
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:31.930
pleaded, Don't make us die for this man's sin and don't hold us responsible for his death. Lord, You

155
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:40.510
have sent this storm upon us for your own good reasons. And then the sailors picked Jonah up and

156
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:49.190
they threw him into the raging sea and the storm stopped at once and the sailors were awestruck by

157
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:57.210
the Lord's great power and they offered him a sacrifice and they vowed to serve him. The story that

158
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:08.230
we are looking at today is a story that starts off just like this. And we don't know the reasons why

159
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:19.660
Jonah is running. And I like that. We don't know yet what God is asking him to do and why we just

160
00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:27.290
see that he's running. And all the reasons that Jonah has for running aren't made clear, but he's

161
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:34.850
running and he's running away from what God is asking him to do. I don't know if you've ever been

162
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:41.450
asked to do something and someone gave you a reason and that reason just wasn't good enough. You

163
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:48.100
didn't believe it. You didn't accept it. You didn't want to follow it. You looked at their reason

164
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:54.390
and the reasoning behind it and you just said, this just isn't strong enough of an argument for me

165
00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:04.480
to do this. But enough of my marriage. Let's talk about this story that is about Jonah because with

166
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:13.580
Jonah, we see that he was running running away from God. And I think back on so many times in my own

167
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:20.020
life where God was asking me to do something, but I just wasn't ready to do it, asking me to give up

168
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.810
something that I desperately wanted to still keep into my life. Things that I thought I needed. And

169
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:31.760
I just didn't identify with my life without it. And I thought if I gave this up there'd be nothing

170
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:37.990
to replace it. I loved it so much. I cared about it so much that there's no way that I could give it

171
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:46.200
up. Sometimes I did that with the right motivation. Sometimes my motivation was was tainted. It was

172
00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:55.730
unhealthy. It was even unrighteous. It was unholy sometimes what I wanted to keep into my life

173
00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:04.960
brought me pleasure. But I didn't see the pain that it was also bringing me and holding onto it was

174
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:13.340
making things worse. Not better, but I didn't want to see that side of things. I just wanted to keep

175
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:24.560
living my life the way that I thought I needed to do so the best way possible for me at that time.

176
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:31.570
And I think many of us in this room can identify and understand that sometimes we're asked to stop

177
00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:41.190
something and we're given ultimatums and were given them out of love, out of concern. We don't like

178
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:49.390
the ultimatum and so we make an effort to change, we make an effort to stop, but we're doing it for

179
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:58.720
someone that we love and someone who's asked us people who care about us because they want the best

180
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:08.100
for us, but we just don't have the inner strength to follow through. I think that Jonah was that

181
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:18.520
kind of a person, a person who was called by God, he knew what his purpose was, but yet he couldn't

182
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:27.760
follow through because he didn't have the inner character to do. So one of the things I've

183
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:36.660
understood about God is that it's not about doing the right thing and the wrong thing, it is about

184
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.840
building our character to always live the right way

185
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:49.730
and once you understand that God is not telling you to stop things and start things and is asking

186
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:56.630
you instead to be everything that he has created you to be, then you begin to understand what it

187
00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:03.030
means to be in a relationship with God. And often when we're in a relationship with God, we keep

188
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:10.950
hearing about what we have to stop or what we have to start, but we don't understand what what God

189
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:20.110
is doing all along is that he is building our character so that we never ever have to ask what we

190
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:28.130
have to stop and start ever again because we'll be able to just live our best life for him and all

191
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:37.510
those around us right now. And when God's bringing Jonah to the realization that him running away

192
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:44.310
isn't gonna be good for him and for others around him, we understand that what God is doing in

193
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:51.570
bringing a storm into his life and into the lives of those sailors is that he's actually looking out

194
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:59.600
for Jonah and I don't always like the way that God looks out for me. I don't always appreciate the

195
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:06.650
storms that he allows or brings deliberately into my life because I know that what God ultimately is

196
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:16.890
trying to do is to build my character. But more than that he wants to increase our capacity. God

197
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:25.570
wants you to be so big, so huge in this world that he wants you to be able to hear from him received

198
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:32.190
from him and accomplished amazing things in his name. But he knows that if he doesn't build your

199
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:39.950
character, he will never be able to increase your capacity. And so what God wants to do is increase

200
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:49.900
your capacity. He wants to do exactly that. Except that there's something standing in the way in

201
00:41:49.900 --> 00:42:00.000
Jonah's life for that to happen, Jonah would rather see his enemies destroyed and annihilated than

202
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:10.820
forgiven. You see the storm that is external is already internal. And the only thing God does is

203
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:21.180
that he exposes the storm that is in Jonah's life by giving him a real physical storm to see. So

204
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:29.410
that he can actually see himself when God sends storms into our life. It's because he wants to

205
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:37.500
expose the storm that is already raging within us. The external storm is his way of getting our

206
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:52.200
attention to the internal storm that has been raging all along, Jonah, running away makes no sense

207
00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.790
when the storm is always within him

208
00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:09.230
and in his case, what he wants is revenge. He wants retribution. He wants the people of Ninevah to

209
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:15.980
pay. And I don't know if you've ever felt like that where you wanted justice, you wanted people who

210
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:21.810
had hurt you, people who had just brought tragedy and trauma

211
00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:33.010
into your life, you wanted them to paint and to this day you still want them to pay. You still feel

212
00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:37.700
like whatever they've gone through, it's nothing in comparison to what they deserve. And and you

213
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:43.920
still can't let it go because you feel like it just hasn't gone far enough. Or maybe the justice

214
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.220
hasn't come at all.

215
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:55.950
And when we hold onto this feeling, we don't understand the storm that this causes within us. But

216
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.950
God knows

217
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:07.660
and the story of Jonah is about revealing that storm in a way that we might possibly miss in our own

218
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:14.620
life if Jonah isn't brought through this so we can learn from him. So the first thing I want to

219
00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:21.270
bring to our attention because it's it's a beautiful chapter. It's a beautiful story. It's a short

220
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:26.910
one and one that I'm sure if you read through it, you can definitely handle it And if you get the

221
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:35.120
chance, I would encourage you to do that. But the one thing I want to focus on right now is found in

222
00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:43.760
verse three And Jonah Verse three says that Jonah got up and he went in the opposite direction to

223
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.460
get away from the Lord. And what he did is that he went down to the ports and he found the ship and

224
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:57.250
he bought a ticket and he went on board and he was hoping to escape from the Lord. And what we see

225
00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:07.700
here is that when we run away from forgiveness, we are actually running away from the Lord. It

226
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:14.560
doesn't feel like that to me because what I'm doing is that I'm just not forgiving a person. I'm

227
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.900
just not forgiving an incident. I'm not I'm not letting go of something that's happened. So how

228
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:26.650
could that be that I'm running away from the Lord. But what the story shows us is that every time we

229
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:35.970
choose not to forgive the person we are running away from first is actually the Lord. That changed

230
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:44.650
everything for me, that changed my perspective on life on all the things that happened to me and

231
00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:51.900
that were done to me the things that even today if I'm not able to let them go. I remember this

232
00:45:51.910 --> 00:46:00.560
story and I think to the fact that I'm not running away from forgiveness, I'm not just running away

233
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:08.650
from that person or that situation or those circumstances, I'm actually running away from the Lord.

234
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:17.400
I'm going in the opposite direction of what he has asked me to do and I have boarded a ship. I have

235
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:25.160
paid the ticket and I've done all this because my interest is in getting away from the Lord. It

236
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:30.690
seems foolish on Jonah's part to get away from God. He knows who God is. He's a prophet. He's called

237
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:36.840
by him. He's teaching others about who the Lord is. So logically he knows he cannot run away from

238
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:42.380
the Lord. But he tries anyways and I want you to see that in our lives we can have a relationship

239
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:49.310
with God but still be running in the opposite direction of what he has asked us to do. And maybe it

240
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:55.660
isn't just about forgiveness and maybe it isn't just simply about seeing justice, but maybe it's

241
00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:00.460
about something else that he's asking us to give up. But we just won't do it because it's more

242
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.820
important to us than obeying the Lord.

243
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:18.430
Yeah. When we run away from forgiveness, we are actually running away from the Lord. Because Jonah

244
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.600
was asked to bring forgiveness to the people that he hated

245
00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:32.040
And Jonah just couldn't do it, he wanted to see the invites dead. Have you ever wished someone dead?

246
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:42.630
The Bible says that when we call someone stupid, it's like wishing their murder. And Jesus

247
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:50.740
wouldn't say that because he wants us to understand how serious it is to go against any of his

248
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:58.140
Children and you're thinking but but there's there's good kids and there's evil kids. Can I just

249
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:06.800
hate the evil ones? I think we already do that. We already naturally hate the evil kids. I think we

250
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:12.810
already naturally hate the evil adults. I think we already naturally find ourselves hating people. I

251
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:19.690
think we already have a problem with this and I don't think this is something that we have to like

252
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.970
learn more about. I think it's something that we have to learn more about so that we can stop doing

253
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:32.510
it. How about you? The problem isn't whether or not we do this. The problem is how do we stop and

254
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:41.180
what God does is that he puts it in perspective for us that even calling someone names is looked

255
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.900
upon by him

256
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:51.630
as something that is as murderous in someone's heart. That's how much he cares about everyone. So

257
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:58.860
Jonah hates this about God. He hates that. He loves the Ninevites as much as he loves the Hebrews

258
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.040
and that's always been the hardest thing for me because I always felt this way, I always felt God

259
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:14.700
when I follow you when I give you my life and I decide to serve you, then I expect my life to be

260
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:22.110
blessed more than everyone else's. I expect the protection level to be higher. I expect my wifi to

261
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:22.870
be stronger.

262
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.740
I want to be able to be anywhere in the world and get full bars no matter what.

263
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:38.330
But what happens instead is that I often see myself kind of like suffering a little bit more than

264
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:43.460
everybody else, at least through my own eyes, there's always someone who's suffering more. But you

265
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:53.000
know, first world problems, I mean, let's be honest, when we live, where we live, you know, we make

266
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.130
a big deal out of things that are not a big deal

267
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:59.990
in comparison to what other people are going through.

268
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:06.780
And so when we look at what's happening in the world, sure, we can always feel a little bit bad

269
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:13.930
about what's happening there. But what about me and the fact that the price on netflix went up again?

270
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:16.620
This is crazy.

271
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:24.570
And so when we look at what's happening in our lives and in our hearts, we begin to realize that God

272
00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:29.590
is trying to teach us something, it's a lot more important than what we've been living and going

273
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:34.730
through on the day to day, and he's saying that there's something that we've been holding back

274
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:42.680
something that we have not been giving up. There's an understanding that we somehow feel that God

275
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:49.440
should favor us more than others and I want you to understand the difference between this concept of

276
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:58.880
God's favor and his grace and how he wants to extend his favor and his grace to everyone. You

277
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:07.430
already have God's grace and he wants to give you his favor through your obedience to all that he

278
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:19.000
has given us to follow him. But he also wants to give his grace and his favor to everyone else. And

279
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.270
so when we don't forgive, we are going against the very essence of who God is and his plan and his

280
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:36.520
purpose for humanity. He is not just interested in building the kingdom of God in you. He is

281
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:45.550
interested in us helping to build the kingdom of God in the world. And when we don't forgive, then

282
00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:54.530
we are holding God back from being able to build his kingdom even in the life of the person that we

283
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:58.110
would least want to see forgiven.

284
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:10.920
I always was shocked and surprised to see Jesus hanging on the cross and one of the thieves that had

285
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:17.120
gotten caught and was being crucified with him, that he would be able to turn to him so quickly and

286
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:25.500
just say on this day because you put your faith in me, you'll be with me in paradise. I always

287
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:30.830
thought that is an amazing loophole in this whole thing.

288
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:40.150
If I could only know when I was gonna die, then I could live the way I wanted

289
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.230
and at the very last second, just say Jesus, I love you

290
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.590
forgive me I follow you for the rest of my minutes.

291
00:52:53.700 --> 00:53:02.190
Four seconds. Thank you for taking me with you into paradise. That'd be awesome. Wouldn't it be like

292
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:08.040
if he knew right? If you knew like this guy knew like he knew he was, it was just seconds he was

293
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:19.580
minutes away from dying. But look at how he missed out on an incredible relationship with the Jesus

294
00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:31.200
who was able to give him eternal life. See if we think this is just about heaven, then we got it all

295
00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:49.650
turned around see God doesn't save us for heaven. He saves us for earth. And then one day 1 day we

296
00:53:49.650 --> 00:54:04.200
will bring Yeah. All that God has expressed in his expression of heaven in the heavens and the earth,

297
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:13.180
he is going to remake it okay? And if we understand this, then we understand that God's purpose is

298
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:20.080
to bring us into a relationship with him like never before. And so in Jonah in chapter one verse

299
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.860
four, look at what it says. But the Lord did something. He hurled a powerful wind over the sea. He

300
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:32.680
caused a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart because when we run away from

301
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:38.890
forgiveness, here's what we're doing. We are actually running towards storms.

302
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.980
And I want you to take a good look at your life and I want you to examine yourself before God and

303
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:52.530
just say Lord are you telling me that the storms that I'm running into is because I'm not able to

304
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:59.840
let this go. And the answer is yes because that storm is within you and what God does is that he

305
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:07.670
manifests the storms that we keep running into so that we can let go of the storm that is raging

306
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:16.620
within us. Get rid of that storm. He says, listen to what I'm asking you to do. Let it go, forgive,

307
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:22.010
move past, I will help you do that. You're not going to have to do this in your own strength, your

308
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:28.740
own way. Whatever seems impossible to you now, you just keep giving that back to me over and over

309
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:37.380
again and here's what's going to happen, I will take care of the storm that is in you and then watch

310
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:48.150
the storm that is around you finally become And you know, they had to throw Jonah into the storm.

311
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:55.940
They didn't want to actually we see them trying everything they're rowing, they're throwing whatever

312
00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:02.340
is on the boat, into the ocean, into the sea. There. Lightening the ship, they're doing whatever

313
00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:11.580
they can. But here's what that tells us. You can't get rid of the storm that is in you. At the end

314
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:18.760
they realized that the only way the storm was going to stop was that if they got rid of Jonah, Jonah

315
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:24.040
was the reason why they kept having a storm. I don't know if you've ever noticed. But sometimes when

316
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.350
we have people in our lives, all we get are storms

317
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:35.520
and sometimes we're just not with the right person. We're just we're just not aligned the way that

318
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:40.260
we need to be and there's always a storm. And then we keep asking ourselves what what is God doing?

319
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.070
Well, the first thing you have to do is you have to make sure that there isn't a storm in you and

320
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:51.780
stop just identifying a storm in another person. Sometimes the easiest thing we do is see the storm

321
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:59.500
is so and so the storm isn't in me. No, no, they're the storm. Let me get rid of the storm. And and

322
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.330
and that means that person and then everything will be calm. But then there's a problem though

323
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:10.300
because there's still something raging within you. That storm is still there. It isn't that person

324
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:15.400
as much as you thought it was, it's actually still you. That's the problem. The problem isn't that

325
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:20.990
person. The problem is you and it's the way that you're dealing with the storm at a certain point,

326
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:28.250
Jonah realizes that he's the cause of the storm. He makes this incredible realization. But you know

327
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:34.840
what's amazing is that before he made that realization, he was denying it all along. These guys were

328
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:40.330
trying to figure out even through their superstitions. They were casting lots that smooth stones

329
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:47.290
with symbols on them and they were like rolling them like dice on the deck in a storm trying to

330
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:53.220
figure out who was responsible and they're looking at each other and everyone had their suspicion of

331
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:59.280
who it was and then everything kept pointing to Jonah and I guess one of the stones had a J. On it

332
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:06.050
or something and they kind of figured out that none of them were like you know a J. And that dude

333
00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:13.270
was a J. And they went to him and they said it's you you're the reason like what did you do? And

334
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:18.080
then they start asking him all these questions and then all of a sudden you realize that the guy

335
00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:29.350
who's causing the storm is this most spiritual guy on the boat. He isn't the guy who's bringing

336
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:38.440
calm to the situation, he's the one who's bringing the storm and I am tired of seeing believers and

337
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:46.970
followers of Jesus bringing storms wherever they go because they're running away from the Lord and

338
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:52.250
instead of bringing up his name, all they can do is bring it down

339
00:58:54.460 --> 00:59:00.680
instead of making sure that the boat gets to the shore, they're just out there ship wrecking

340
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:08.710
everybody, they're out there wrecking people's lives and I want you to see that God doesn't want us

341
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:14.010
to be that dude doesn't want us to be that girl doesn't want us to be that person who's out there

342
00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:21.630
living like Jonah, Jonah thinking that he's just like you know the man of God and and the one who

343
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:26.910
has the word and the one who can decide whether or not he brings that word to the Ninevites or

344
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:35.460
not. And he's the one causing the storm in the first place. God wants us to be out there bringing

345
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:46.760
peace. That's what he calls us to to be peacemakers. He wants us out there, making sure that we're

346
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:54.540
handling our business. So the storm that is within us is under God's control and that we stop trying

347
00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:00.660
to control it and contain it and we keep trying to divert it and we keep looking at other people and

348
01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.940
trying to escape from it and trying to blame others for it. But God wants us to handle our business.

349
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:12.310
Are you guys ready to do that because Jonah finally does and you know what he does? He says throw me

350
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.420
into the sea. He finally owns up to it. But it took a long time because look at what happens in

351
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:24.320
verse five, fearing for their lives. The desperate soul sailors. I don't know why I keep someone to

352
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:30.900
say soldiers twice now shot it to their gods for help and they threw the cargo overboard to lighten

353
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:39.100
the ship all this time, Jonah, look at this. He was sound asleep down in the hold. All this is going

354
01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:47.070
on and the guy's asleep, he's sleeping. And the reason he's sleeping is because when we are running

355
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:54.450
away from the Lord, we are running into darkness and listen to this: we are running into depression.

356
01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.880
This is what the storm causes. It doesn't matter what's happening around you Because you already

357
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:09.310
wanna die. You listening to me? This is how bad it can get. This is how far it can go. This is what

358
01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:16.320
happened to Jonah. He doesn't care when he says throw me into the sea. The guy says I can't kill

359
01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:25.840
myself. I was hoping that I would go down with the ship. So you guys do it for me. Do you understand

360
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:33.380
what's happening in the story? I don't know if you ever saw Jonah as a suicide story but today I am

361
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:39.270
telling you this is a story about a man who would rather die than forgive.

362
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:49.260
He would rather his life came to a halting end than go to where God was asking him to go to do what

363
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.880
God was asking him to do,

364
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.640
Jonah

365
01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.210
wants to die

366
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:08.710
and he would rather die. Then give in to what god is asking him. And sometimes we have this

367
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:16.430
expression you know over my dead body, anybody ever say that you don't actually mean it right until

368
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.050
you do.

369
01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:27.090
And I think that's what happened to Jonah. I don't think he meant it until he meant it. Until he got

370
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:35.790
to that place where he was willing and ready to die. He didn't care anymore. That's why when a storm

371
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.580
is raging, you can go fall asleep in the boat.

372
01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:50.640
You can go to sleep in the boat because you want to go down with it and when they come and they ask

373
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:58.650
him, what are you doing, sleeping, shouldn't you be praying to your god because that's what we're

374
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:05.000
doing. They start asking questions about him because they don't understand how this guy could be

375
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.520
asleep, not praying like everybody else

376
01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.980
and then he says I'm a hebrew

377
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:25.500
and then he says, I believe in God, The one who created the heavens and the earth, The one who sent

378
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:32.800
the storm and they're like dude, are you crazy? Why aren't you doing something about this?

379
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:46.170
And his answer is just throw me into the sea, okay, I'm not going to speak to God. Have you ever

380
01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:53.260
been so angry with God that you just stopped speaking to him, You just stopped praying. You just

381
01:03:53.260 --> 01:04:01.040
stopped believing. You just said, you know, just forget this, Jesus stuff. You just walked away. I

382
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.660
mean this is what Jonah is trying to do. But you see what's happening is that he's getting further

383
01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:11.340
and further into darkness and further and further into depression and he just now just wants to die.

384
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:17.320
That's that's the place where he's at. So when they throw him into the ocean, you always wonder like

385
01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:27.410
why was Jonah swallowed by a great fish and whether you believe that story or not, literally, that's

386
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:31.780
besides the point, that's something you're gonna have to work through in your own spiritual journey,

387
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:41.440
but I can only tell you this if you miss the fact that Jonah wants to die and God won't let him then

388
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.790
you've missed the most important part of that whole story.

389
01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:57.430
God does not want us depressed in darkness wanting to die, can we say amen to that? He will not

390
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:05.200
leave us there and he will do whatever he needs to do, he will command whatever he needs to command

391
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:12.910
to come and rescue us. And the way that he went after Jonah is the way that he will come after us.

392
01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:22.750
Now what's amazing about the story that we're in is that Jonah gets rescued because god wants to

393
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:34.080
make sure that he will always always know without any doubt that once Jonah deals with the storm

394
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:44.410
that is raging within him then god will take care of every storm that is around him, you know it

395
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:53.390
took three days for him to finally pray like how stubborn is this dude, a like seriously now that he

396
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:58.690
is in the mouth of a fish, a large fish or whale, who knows what whatever it was that was around at

397
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:08.770
that time he's in there and he will not pray. He didn't want to pray on the boat, he said he'd

398
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:14.120
rather die and he followed through on that. He went into the ocean. God had to rescue him, swallow

399
01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:20.870
him up and kept him in the belly of the fish and he kept him there for three days and then finally

400
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:30.100
he saw that God wasn't gonna give in and give up and so then he finally does. He prays. And what God

401
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:37.340
does is that he has the fish spit him out on the beach and when he's on the beach He still won't go

402
01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:37.610
to Nineveh.

403
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:51.160
oh he still doesn't want to do it, but he's closer now than he ever was before. And so here's what I

404
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.170
want you to understand the journey that we've all been on spiritually. Is this God keeps getting us

405
01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:05.780
closer and closer and closer until we finally go through with what it is that he's asking us to do

406
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:11.950
and I don't know what it's gonna take. It's different for all of us. Some of us get there quicker

407
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:18.340
than others, but we can see from Jonah that even when he finally walks through the gates of the city

408
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:24.670
of Ninevah and he pronounces his judgment and the king hears it and the king gets all the people to

409
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:33.200
repent and to cry out for forgiveness that he still goes up on the mountain to get a good view of

410
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.110
God destroying Nineveh.

411
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:47.970
Even when he was up on the hill wanting to still see the people of Nineveh destroyed.

412
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:53.210
You could see that God's work in his life wasn't yet done

413
01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:05.490
and Jonah is like sweating bullets out there in the sun. So God makes a plant grow out of the ground

414
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:13.840
out of nowhere and just gives them shade and he's like yeah that's better now I can watch these

415
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:24.380
people burn and comfort. And as he's under this palm tree sipping his peanut colada or as tequila

416
01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.110
sunrise or whatever it was. Yeah,

417
01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:36.940
The people don't get burnt up. No one dies. It's a bad day for Jonah. He's deeply disappointed by

418
01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:44.350
all this. This is not how he wanted the story to end. And then all of a sudden God makes that plant

419
01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:49.350
that he just made sprout out of nowhere. That tree that just came out and gave him incredible shade

420
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:59.830
and it just dies because he sees that his heart is still bitter, still hates the Ninevites.

421
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:07.760
Nothing's changed not to the extent that God wants and then all of a sudden Jonah gets so enraged,

422
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:14.240
so upset that he starts to curse the plant that once gave him shade

423
01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:23.150
and God says you care more about that tree that gave you shade

424
01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:33.930
than 10s of thousands of people in that city. What does that say about you? Yeah.

425
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:39.920
And in that moment Jonah finally gets it,

426
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:46.610
there's gonna be a breaking point for all of us when we're finally going to give it up, we're

427
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:52.910
finally gonna let it go. We're finally gonna get to that place where we can trust God for all of it.

428
01:09:54.930 --> 01:10:02.890
And I wanted tell you that there are verses in the scriptures that can encourage us about what that

429
01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:03.720
standard is.

430
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:14.060
And here's the first one, it's in Deuteronomy 32, says I will take revenge. I will pay them back in

431
01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:19.660
due time. Their feet will slip, their day of disaster will arrive and their destiny will overtake

432
01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:28.860
them. In Romans 12:17-19: Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone

433
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:34.580
can see that you are honorable, do all that you can to live in peace with everyone. Dear friends

434
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:40.700
never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous Anger of God. For the scriptures, say, I will take

435
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.180
revenge, I will pay them back, says the Lord

436
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:52.070
Matthew 1821 - 22. Then Peter came to him and asked Lord, how often should I forgive someone who

437
01:10:52.070 --> 01:11:03.020
sins against me seven times. No, Not seven times, Jesus replied. But 70 times seven,

438
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:16.720
you probably feel worse right now. But I want you to feel better because these verses or about

439
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:29.600
reminding us that the only one who is perfect enough to judge is God and he promises to do it and

440
01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.610
that we don't have to worry about it.

441
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:43.650
And if you occupy your time with vengeance, Revenge and retribution. You are wasting your life.

442
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:56.990
You're wasting your future for something that happened in the past. You are not living today. Nor

443
01:11:56.990 --> 01:12:03.330
are you gonna be able to live tomorrow because every day this is going to bother you hurt you? It is

444
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:11.640
going to rage within you and you're gonna keep running into storms of your own making. You may not

445
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.550
have been responsible for the first one, but you're responsible for everyone after that.

446
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:26.930
I have to say that again. You're not responsible for the first one, but you're responsible for

447
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:42.180
everyone after that. If that storm in you is in calmed by you obeying what the Lord has asked you to

448
01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:51.020
do, can we say amen to that? I know it's not easy to do this stuff. That's why it's in the Bible,

449
01:12:53.820 --> 01:13:00.100
but it's there so that we can learn from it, grow from it and begin to put it into practice. So we

450
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:06.800
can see the change in us, in our relationships in our business. We can see the change in our bodies,

451
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:14.260
in our health. We can see it in our finances. We can see it even in the areas of our past that we

452
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:27.060
hate to revisit. So we can have a glorious future together with God who can calm every storm. Amen.

453
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:32.340
God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Would you guys stand as we close in a word of prayer?

454
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:43.070
And so father, I want to thank you for your word today and for how you have taught us about dealing

455
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:49.680
with the storms in our life and the ones that rage around us and today we have learned from the life

456
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:57.660
of Jonah and it has spoken about our own lives and how we need to let go of the things of the past

457
01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:04.760
that we can have that glorious future that you have in store for all of us? Not only were the nine

458
01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:14.110
invites spared and saved, but so was Jonah and Lord, that is the outcome that you desire for all of

459
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:22.550
us, A blessing that can come not only to us but to those around us. And I pray that for all of us

460
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:30.290
for the great things that you have in store for each of us as we let go of the past and we pray this

461
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:36.930
in Jesus name, Amen. Amen. Thanks everybody. So we're gonna sing one more song before we go and I

462
01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:42.180
just want you to hang around for the after party if you can. And next Sunday's our fall fest. It's

463
