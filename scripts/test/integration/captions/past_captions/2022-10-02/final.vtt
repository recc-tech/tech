3
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:20.300
It's called. I, I agree that it's especially cold this morning. Obviously I was praying for no

4
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.920
winter this year. Uh, so I have no success in my prayer, but I'll still continue to do that. But no,

95
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:48.950

96
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:59.830
Monica and she's really not sure about that next part. Um so three, three weeks ago there was really

97
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:06.530
an important event that we've missed uh in case you have never noticed Michelle and Monica, our

98
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.520
sister,

99
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:20.530
twin sister. Uh and uh three weeks ago, uh they changed decade, it was their birthday. They finally

100
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:33.150
They finally end third in the 30s. So yeah, so you can clap your hands for that. Absolutes. And so

101
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:42.040
this morning it was really important for us as a community to really, you've been really dedicated

102
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:50.340
faithful to that community for more than decades. And uh you know seriously and really don't want it

103
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:59.100
to, to pass this. So that was really important to unnoticed. Thank you so much Michelle. You should

104
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:05.470
stay always with me to to help me when I'm doing the announcement and translate. Exactly. So we

121
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.850
message brought by Yohan. I don't know who's that unknown person, but he's gonna be there for the

122
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:22.570
message. Lorenzo will be away for that weekend. So the title of the message will be chatter and it's

123
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:29.790
gonna be about the voices in our head or the voice in our head. Do anybody have voice in their head

126
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:53.290

128
00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:07.880
don't miss that October 16 with Yvonne that will be with us. Also we encourage you to support us

129
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:13.610
financially if you can. For those of you who are visiting us don't be worried, we won't take your

130
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:19.780
wallet. It's not something that will impose on you. Never, ever. But the idea is that if you like

131
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:25.150
that community, you like that family and you wanna support the ministry in the different activities

132
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:32.090
that are happening here. Please consider one of these four ways to give to make sure that we sustain

133
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:37.470
everything that is happening here. So there's the after party. You don't want to miss that

134
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:44.240
especially today with those wonderful cakes. But each Sunday as well, let's take a look at that

135
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.840
video for the kids.

136
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:31.460
So for the kids you are welcome to go in the N. X. There's a program that has been prepared for you.

137
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:39.050
So now is the time for you to go and for the youth we'll ask you to stay here. There's no program

138
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:45.450
for you today. So you'll stay with us for the service. So without further delay please welcome

139
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.920
Pastor Lorenzo.

140
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:19.220
Great. So wonderful to be with you today and to be a part of this community of faith that God is

141
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:25.150
just blessing week after week. It's so great to see so many of you and to see so many coming back

142
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.950
and we are so excited for what God has been doing in this season and what he's going to be doing in

143
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.720
the weeks to come. And that's why we're in this series called Fresh Start and we're talking about

144
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:42.570
how we can revisit the past for a better future. And we see how God puts people in circumstances

145
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:49.370
just like that in the scriptures. And today we're gonna be looking at the life of Moses and how God

146
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:57.360
did that in his own life and how God is able to speak through his life to our own today and today

147
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:06.980
we're gonna be talking about reluctant and Moses is a perfect example of a reluctant leader of

148
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:16.520
someone who feels that he has been very much disqualified. His actions of the past are haunting him

149
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:24.050
to the day that God reaches out to him. There's so many things that he felt he had run away from,

150
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:32.750
but it followed him wherever he went. And it didn't matter how many years he spent wandering and

151
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:39.860
rebuilding his life, he always felt like he didn't measure up and if you've ever felt like that I

152
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:46.800
have ever felt like God was somehow keeping you from experiencing your best life or things in your

153
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:53.510
past weren't letting you go for you to be able to live. That then this message I'm sure is going to

154
00:32:53.510 --> 00:33:01.630
speak to you as it did to me. One of the verses that I wanted to begin sharing with you is actually

155
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:07.890
found in exodus chapter three and verse 11 and we're gonna be bouncing around a little bit between

156
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:15.240
two chapters found in chapter three and chapter four. And we're going to look at the areas of Moses

157
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:23.700
life where he felt where his past was preventing him from experiencing a greater future. And this

158
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:31.200
first verse, it says that when God calls Moses to go back into Egypt, a place that he knew really

159
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.790
well because he had been adopted by pharaoh's daughter and was raised an Egyptian. He found himself

160
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:47.210
in the palace and so he was by all intents and purposes, a prince of Egypt and as a result, he could

161
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:53.120
have ascended to that throne. He wouldn't have most likely, but he could have and he would have had

162
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:59.280
status and stature and he would have had everything that comes with being a part of pharaoh's

163
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:07.430
household. But there was a day in which he saw a hebrew being mistreated now remember they were

164
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:19.480
being enslaved and he was one who escaped the murder of all the first born Children of the tribe of

165
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:26.610
Israel and imagine that all of them were in mourning when this occurred, Moses was spared because

166
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:34.110
one day God would use Moses in the way that he envisioned and somehow Moses had this in his heart.

167
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:40.040
He was torn between his two identities and if you ever been torn between two cultures, two places,

168
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:47.460
two identities, two names to parents. Uh, you know, just two tribes, it just feels like you, you

169
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:56.080
never know where you fit. And I remember one time when I was um, you know, being raised in Montreal,

170
00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.890
I was born here but I didn't really feel like I was, you know, a quebecer, my parents were

171
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:10.670
immigrants, they met and married here became citizens in the early seventies and, and I was given

172
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.490
the opportunity to be instructed in both english and in french and I did and, and living my life

173
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:21.720
here, I learned three languages, I had three languages at my availability and when the time came to

174
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:28.100
fulfill my calling, God put her on my heart to study and I thought what better place to do. So, but

175
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:32.780
you know, in Italy where my parents are from and so I went to university there and I started to

176
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:39.140
study theology and I did my first degree uh in theology in Rome, when I got there, I thought, you

177
00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:44.760
know, I would be among my people, but as soon as I arrived there, everyone just kept calling me

178
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:52.470
americano, I wasn't italian to them and I thought that was strange, my parents are italian, I speak

179
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:58.970
italian have an italian name, you can't get a more italian named Lorenzo and I'm like like is it

180
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:04.120
possible that you don't see me as such? And and they didn't and then I realized for the first time

181
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.640
in my life I really didn't fit anywhere anywhere. I felt like that and it's like it's it's a crazy

182
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:15.620
feeling not having that identity, not having that place and and really it's something that that kind

183
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:22.010
of stuck with me until I understood that there was something that elevated that to a place where I

184
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:27.910
would know that no matter what I would always fit in because God spoke to me one day and he says

185
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:36.680
Lorenzo don't worry about the country that you're a citizen of the people that do not receive you

186
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:45.630
because you are now a citizen of heaven, you belong to me, you always have and I just clicked and I

187
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:55.040
realized that my life was not to be led and lived by a passport or by our language or by our culture.

188
00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:05.440
My life was to be lived and lead by being under the headship of my heavenly father and that I was

189
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:15.170
not a citizen of a country above being a citizen of heaven and when you understand this and it

190
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:22.390
doesn't matter how you fit in anymore as much as it matters to know that you fit in absolutely

191
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:34.540
everywhere. That you belong everywhere because you powerfully belong to the father who owns it all,

192
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:46.880
can we say amen to that? And and so you are a son and a daughter of the most high God and you are in

193
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:55.830
that kingdom, that is your kingdom. And so when Moses gets approached, he's struggling with this

194
00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:04.240
identity issue and and God reminds him of that identity that is rooted in him. And and then he

195
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:11.670
reframes everything that he's ever lived. And so what happens is that Moses is still struggling with

196
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:20.220
this as we often do and begins to formulate excuses. And so what I've done is gone through the story

197
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:31.380
and I've picked out the five excuses that Moses makes so that he doesn't have to revisit his past.

198
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:41.510
There are five things that he says to God. So he doesn't have to go back. So he doesn't need to

199
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:49.920
revisit the past. And so the first one is here in exodus 3 11 and it says Moses protested to God.

200
00:38:49.920 --> 00:39:00.750
And he says, who am I to appear before pharaoh and who am I to lead the people of Israel out of

201
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:12.240
Egypt. And so the first thing that that he says, and he's saying is I am not enough, I'm not enough.

202
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:22.470
The first thing he says, I am not enough who am I to go back and do this. And then what he's in

203
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:31.410
essence saying is don't you remember who I am? Don't you remember what I've done? Don't don't you

204
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:39.030
recall what it was that I did to disqualify myself in this process so that you would never have to

205
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:45.190
deal with me again. Isn't this why I left? And isn't this why I have been hiding out in

206
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:54.310
this desert for all these years and now now you come and and often in our lives we just keep dealing

207
00:39:54.310 --> 00:40:03.850
with this issue of of not being enough and and we have believe the lies over and over again and and

208
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:09.810
not just because they have come from what we would call maybe even reliable sources. And I'm not

209
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:15.580
just talking about ourselves because no one knows us better than than we do. But I'm talking about

210
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:23.040
where we have heard this from others in our life, where they have come and stepped into our life and

211
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:30.380
have said that we were not enough and we believed it. And I want you to see that God challenges this

212
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:39.200
in the life of Moses and he is absolutely challenging this in your life right now. And I don't care

213
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:47.540
what the reason is that. You can still justify why you think you're not enough because Jesus Christ

214
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:57.210
has defeated that excuse on the cross. He has made you good enough. He says you were good enough to

215
00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:04.910
die for good enough to give his life up for good enough to come and make your life, his temple good

216
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:12.920
enough to pick up residents in every room in your house, that is your life and make sure that no

217
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:22.740
space would ever be occupied by anyone or anything other than Jesus himself. And so right now, if

218
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:29.940
your mind is still somehow telling you, you are not enough, then you know that is not God speaking,

219
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:37.210
That is not Jesus speaking to you, that is satan. There is no other way to say it other than it is

220
00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:47.720
darkness and it is not the voice that you are to listen to or follow. And so when you hear that

221
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:56.510
excuse, you are not enough, then you know, this is not from God, this is not from him. Let's look at

222
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:05.130
another excuse that he comes up with in exodus 3 13 he says, but Moses protested and he says, if I

223
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:13.460
go to the people of Israel and then I tell them the God of your ancestors has sent me to you, they

224
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:25.590
will ask me what is his name, then, what should I tell them? And so the excuse that he comes up with

225
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:33.280
now is that he's not informed enough, he's not educated enough, that he isn't, not just good enough,

226
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:43.170
but he doesn't have the answers. And often I've felt like that in my role and my responsibilities

227
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:49.170
and as a, as a husband, as a father, as a pastor, as a community leader, as a, as a pro sports

228
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:54.480
chaplain, all the things that I end up doing, I look at all the times where I just feel inadequate,

229
00:42:54.490 --> 00:43:00.320
where I feel like in a moment where I'm being asked the question, I'm like, I don't have an answer

230
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:07.080
to this question and in that moment I turned to God and I say God, would you give me an answer that

231
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:14.090
is adequate for this person? Would you take this mouth and fill it with something decent so that I

232
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:21.850
can give this person some kind of of a semblance of, of something that is meaningful and powerful

233
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:28.560
and impactful. So they will hear that which we need to hear in this moment that even if I can't

234
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:36.950
adequately answer the question that you will some how do that on my behalf. And in that moment Moses

235
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:45.470
looks at himself and and he sees what God is asking him and he's saying, I don't have answers, I

236
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:51.270
don't know enough. Have you ever felt like like that in your own spiritual life? Have you ever felt

237
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:58.510
like that when you're trying to raise your kids or do your job and everyone's looking to you because

238
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:04.630
it's in your department and you don't know how to do this. Have you ever been asked to fix something

239
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:13.020
or do something and you can't go to your phone to google it and you don't have time to like see a

240
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:20.680
youtube tutorial on it. Like you just don't have that moment in which you can just say, excuse me

241
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:28.810
while you, you run to the bathroom and hope you have strong wifi like that, that's often what we do

242
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:34.340
in situations like that. But but what happens when you don't have the answers well, but Moses is

243
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:42.840
being told is that Moses you can rely on me. The answers aren't going to come from you, they're

244
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:51.580
gonna come from me and God doesn't just tell him who to say he is, but then he gives him something,

245
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:59.780
he empowers him with the staff and and with that staff, he says you're gonna be able to go into

246
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:09.620
settings and you're gonna be able to represent my power in a way that you could never do on your own.

247
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:16.840
Now the difference between Moses and Jesus and the scriptures is that Jesus didn't have a magic

248
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:24.940
stick, he didn't need it, Jesus was all magic. Does that make sense? Like he was in the embodiment

249
00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:31.450
of God's presence? So he didn't need the staff. So God didn't have to put his power into something

250
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:37.950
that he could then carry around with him. And so wherever Moses went with his staff, he was bringing

251
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:44.300
the power of God with him. So we know that when he, you know, would would put that that staff down

252
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:49.730
like things would get out of the way, like, like water, like at the red sea, he parted the seas with

253
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:56.730
it or he would turn into a snake and eat all the other snakes that were present as a demonstration

254
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:03.100
of how God was greater and more powerful, that there was no serpent that satan could come up with,

255
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:10.920
that could even take God out who had created the serpents in the first place that that staff would

256
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:17.010
be able to do the very things that Moses couldn't do on his own. And I want you to imagine that,

257
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:23.320
that when we feel like we don't have the answers, what God does is that he has made us the

258
00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:29.310
embodiment of his son and savior, that he has made us his ambassadors in this world. He has sent

259
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:37.490
this out in his name and he has given us his power to be able to do things in his name. And he

260
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:43.190
showed the disciples this very thing, he didn't give them each a staff. He actually told them, I

261
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:48.230
want you to bring nothing with you and he sent them out two by two and when he sent them out two by

262
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:57.340
two, he told them. The only thing I want you to do is use my name and my name will be enough to

263
00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:05.090
provide for you my name Enough will be enough to protect you my name. Enough will be enough to show

264
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:14.180
and to reveal my power whenever you will need it. And so in those days when we don't feel like we're

265
00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:19.720
enough were in those days and where we feel like we don't have the answers, God is saying I can be

266
00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:27.040
both of those things and so Moses gets reminded of this in the scriptures, he gets told that his

267
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:35.550
excuse is not going to stand up to what God has in store for him instead. And here's the third one

268
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:42.090
in exodus chapter four verse one it says, but Moses protested again and he says, what if they won't

269
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:53.470
believe me or they don't listen to me? What if they say that the Lord never appeared to you? In

270
00:47:53.470 --> 00:48:01.410
other words? What happens if they just straight out call me a liar? What if they just basically say

271
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:10.670
that? I have no credibility? What if they say that I don't have what it takes for us to believe in

272
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:23.650
you or to follow you. In essence, they were saying what if Moses asks, they don't see me as a leader

273
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:31.100
and I know that one of the things that a lot of people struggle with is leadership, I think for some

274
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:40.060
reason or other we have somehow relegated ourselves to chair # two or just simply to the back of the

275
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:48.690
bus, like where we just avoid leadership altogether, but we feel like that's just not who we are,

276
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:55.090
what we're about, what we should be doing. And interestingly enough, I always think I see people who

277
00:48:55.100 --> 00:49:01.340
behave like leaders but are not leaders because they don't serve anybody. They only actually live

278
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:09.940
for themselves. And I think one of the most challenging things about leadership is going outside of

279
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:18.250
yourself, making sure that others around you are actually cared for a leader doesn't put himself

280
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:24.950
first, A leader puts the safety of his team first, and interestingly enough, Jesus does this in the

281
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:31.990
Garden of Gethsemane, and we kind of visited this passage a few times already, but I wanted to

282
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:37.320
highlight something that I haven't said and and it's that there was three different personalities in

283
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:44.760
that garden, Jesus was one of them, and what he does is that he stands out when they come to arrest

284
00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:52.100
him and he says take me and leave everyone else alone And then you have Judas who's just thinking

285
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:57.140
about himself, who's trying to build his own kingdom. And the only thing he cares about is his 30

286
00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:02.680
pieces of silver and and building his own name, his own brand, his own reputation, his own kingdom,

287
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:07.040
and he's like if Jesus isn't going to take care of me, I'm gonna take care of myself, and so he goes

288
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:12.970
out and does his own thing, and he betrays Jesus and the other disciples so that he can set himself

289
00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:18.770
up for the future. And then the third person in the story is someone who wants to be a leader, but

290
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:25.040
every time he steps out, he screws it up somehow, and that's Peter, Peter wants to save everybody in

291
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.910
the group, so what he does is he pulls out his sword and he goes after the high priest misses him

292
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:37.600
kills no one and only Maims the servant and the ear is on the ground now, and Jesus had just

293
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:45.890
basically negotiated the greatest rescue of all time by saying, take me and leave my disciples alone,

294
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:52.860
They agree, and then Peter messes that up and when Peter messes that up, Jesus now has to look at

295
00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:58.230
that and says, I'm gonna take this here and I'm gonna put it back on and what he does is that he

296
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:05.450
eliminates what Peter does as a leader in the mistakes that he made. But then when Peter said, I

297
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:10.400
screwed up so badly, I not only screwed up that day when they came to arrest him, but I also messed

298
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:17.940
up after that when they asked me if I believed in Jesus and whether I would would follow him always,

299
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:27.040
I said to Jesus yes, but when I was asked in front of people who could take my life, I said no and I

300
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:34.160
didn't just say it once, I said it twice and I said it three times, I denied Jesus three times. So

301
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:40.430
what does Jesus have to do? He's got to go and find, Jesus, Jesus has to go and find Peter because

302
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:50.660
Peter has gone back to his past, he's gone back to fishing and Jesus says, I called you away from

303
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:56.510
fishing so you could become a fisher of men and so now I need you to go and I need you to go and

304
00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:03.440
take care of my sheep, I need you to go and I want you to go and feed my lambs, can we say amen to

305
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:11.440
that. And so we see three different types of people Judas is taking leadership of his own life,

306
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:18.500
Jesus is making sure is taking care of the life of everybody else. Excuse me, Judas is taking care

307
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:23.300
of his own life and Peter is trying to take care of everybody, but he's not doing a very good job at

308
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:31.200
it. And and and and all of those cases, right? The only person who's lost is Judas. And you know why?

309
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:39.760
Because Judas couldn't get past his own excuses. And so Judas goes and he hangs himself and he kills

310
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.690
himself because he cannot live with the fact that he betrayed Jesus. And even though he gives the

311
00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:54.840
money back, listen to this, he still lived in the past and he couldn't accept that Jesus had already

312
00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:02.300
freed him from that past. And in the same way that Jesus went after Peter after he had resurrected,

313
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:10.240
I assure you, he would have gone after Judas. He probably would've went for Judas first. But he

314
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:16.160
didn't get the chance because Judas took his own life because he couldn't get past his past.

315
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:31.160
And in the story that we are in, we're seeing Moses take into his hands leadership when he sees a

316
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:41.280
hebrew slave that's being mistreated, he kills the Egyptian who's mistreating him and then he buries

317
00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:51.300
his body in the sand and what Jesus does? And he says to him Moses, I need you to go back to the

318
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.170
place where the body is buried

319
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.530
because until you do, you will never be free. Can we say amen to that?

320
00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:11.730
I expected that to be a wiki man because we all got bodies that are buried

321
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.520
or bodies we wanna bury.

322
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.950
That's probably the truer statement.

323
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:31.120
And we want to make sure that we don't have to go back to places that we have left behind.

324
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:42.150
But what God does, it's gonna say to each and every one of us in this room. This is how you are a

325
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:52.100
leader. This is how you show leadership. When you go back to the very place that you left, you ran

326
00:54:52.100 --> 00:55:04.840
away from and you show them a new kind of leader, a new kind of leadership, a new kind of power.

327
00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:12.110
One that isn't from your own strength, that takes the life of others and buries them in the sand.

328
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:22.050
But one that is able to rescue a million slaves under the bondage of Egypt. Amen.

329
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:32.550
And God is saying, I want to send you out into the world to set people free. But I can't use you

330
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:43.310
like that until you're free. And so I want to free you first. I want to call you into your place and

331
00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:51.870
into your position and into your purpose and into your power. I want to do that with you now. And so

332
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:59.520
what Moses speaks to us about is how no one is beyond that, no one has passed that point. How, how

333
00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:06.680
everyone had disqualified Moses and for good reason, God says that's exactly who I'm going to use

334
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:14.000
soul. That whenever someone feels that they are not good enough. Whenever someone feels that they

335
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.100
don't have the answers. Whenever someone feels that they are not a leader, they can think of how I

336
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:29.050
used you Moses and they can rise from the ashes. They can get out of their past and now experience

337
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:38.100
the future that have always promised you. It's a beautiful story. But we still have two more excuses

338
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.460
in exodus. Chapter four verse 10 it says, but Moses pleaded with the Lord and he says, Oh Lord, I'm

339
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:53.340
not very good with words and I never have been. And I'm not now, even though you have spoken to me,

340
00:56:53.350 --> 00:57:00.900
I get tongue tied and my words get tangled and he's in essence saying I'm not a very good public

341
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:08.680
speaker. It's not, I'm not very eloquent. I've never been one to talk my way out of a situation,

342
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:16.680
which is why there's a dead Egyptian back in Egypt. Like this is my problem. Like this is who I am

343
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:23.000
and this is the struggles that I have and this is what I'm not good of. Um, how many of you in

344
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.750
school would just avoid any form of class when you had the choice that that required any type of

345
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:34.990
public speaking involved, like you just avoided it, right. And and and a lot of times like if we

346
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:42.800
think about it, most of us just don't enjoy it when we don't like it. We don't, I feel like we're

347
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:48.600
good at it or something that we want to do every single day. Another of us like we just feel like,

348
00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:54.310
yeah, like I was made for this. Like I can do this in front of people, I can do this in front of the

349
00:57:54.310 --> 00:58:01.620
camera or we developed the ability to do it. Like we just get comfortable with it. We weren't at

350
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:07.840
first, but we got more comfortable as we did it and just pushed ourselves and pushed ourselves or

351
00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:15.790
the situation pushed us and and and made us go into the uncomfortable places until we got better at

352
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:22.210
it. And and and felt a little bit more confident and believed that we could actually have something

353
00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:29.730
that people should listen to. And and all of a sudden we, we changed that that image and

354
00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:35.540
understanding of who we were and how we saw ourselves and then people started to look at us

355
00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:41.040
differently and they looked at us and said, I never thought that you had this in you, that you could

356
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:49.510
do this, that you would be able to be able to speak this way and I want you to understand that

357
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:57.080
that's exactly what God did with Moses. He took someone who looked at himself and said I am not good

358
00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:05.160
enough for this part, you should really get someone else. And and and God looks at Moses and says,

359
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:12.460
don't you understand? You're the one that I've chosen for this and what you believe you are not good

360
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:22.270
at, I will make you good at. I will give you what you need to do this. And that could come in the

361
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:28.280
form of someone being added to the team. And in his case, he says, I know you have a brother and

362
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:37.450
he'll come alongside you and he'll help you. But but Moses no one can take your place. It still

363
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:45.970
needs to be you. I can put someone beside you, but it still needs to be you. And what we often don't

364
00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:53.790
realize is that were that important to God. We sometimes don't see ourselves as that important. But

365
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:59.950
I imagine all the people that we meet every day, all the people that God puts in our life and on our

366
00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:05.800
path. And every time that happens, we just keep thinking somebody else should do something about

367
01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:15.430
this. Somebody else should really help this person. It's a good thing that I have Pastor Zo's

368
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:22.380
cellphone because I can call him right now and tell him about this need that he has to do something

369
01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:29.400
about. Because if he doesn't do it, then he's not gonna be the servant of God that I envisioned and

370
01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.930
imagined him to do it. I know God put him on my path. But he only put him on my path so that Pastor Zo

371
01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:41.930
could do something about it And we often think like that. But what does God do with each of us is

372
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:53.850
that he says that every one of us is his disciple, that we are his apostles, that we are, his eyes,

373
01:00:53.860 --> 01:01:01.720
his ears, his mouth, his hands, his feet, that when we see people in need, we're not supposed to go

374
01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:10.230
to them and say I'm gonna pray for you. I hope God intervenes for you. I hope that God helps you,

375
01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:18.840
but we are supposed to help them because God has brought them to us, that responsibility hasn't

376
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:26.770
shifted from us to someone else. It is something that God has put on our path for us to do and I

377
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:32.400
know that we're going to come up with all the reasons why we shouldn't and I'm sure some of them are

378
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.940
solid and some of them are good and I'm sure that some of them have been well thought through in

379
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:45.870
advance because we don't want to do things that would somehow deter us from our main thing, our real

380
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:51.190
purpose in life and our goals. And and I get that and that's true, we have to take that into

381
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:58.500
consideration. I know it's important sometimes we can feel overwhelmed, hard to help somebody when

382
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:04.620
we're going through our own things. It's very hard to be there for someone when we've got to talk

383
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:10.370
them out of something. I can't even talk myself out of bed in the morning, how am I gonna do that? I

384
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:17.070
understand, I get it. But you know what I know is that in the moments when we are our weakest, that

385
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:26.300
is when God can be the strongest. It is when we can't that we can see God can, it is then that we

386
01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:33.540
can turn to Jesus and he can take whatever excuse we have whatever weaknesses real or imagined and

387
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:39.890
flip that and then turn us into the people that he needs us to be for the people who need it the

388
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:48.270
most who he has put on our path to help, not for someone else, but for us. And there's something

389
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:53.470
that we often don't do, we don't ask God God in this moment, honestly. Like is this something that I

390
01:02:53.470 --> 01:03:00.760
should do or do I just make that decision without praying asking God, do I just just say no

391
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:07.770
automatically or do I seek God and his guidance in this situation? I know that God wants to lead us,

392
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:16.440
He wants to move us away from our excuses. And especially from things like I'm just not equipped as

393
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:22.810
a leader or I'm not a public speaker. I'm not the person who can help this person because I don't

394
01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:30.250
have answers. I'm not the person who can do this because well let's be honest, I'm not enough. And

395
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:37.760
all of those excuses are gonna seem like the right answer in the moment and they were for Moses. But

396
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:44.650
guess what? It didn't change God's mind about Moses and thank God because we saw what Moses did. As

397
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:53.520
a result he gave us the commandments. He parted the red sea, he brought the 10 plagues to to reveal

398
01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:01.750
God's power over and over again he set his people free and he did all of those things, even knowing

399
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.690
that here's the last excuse that he was never qualified. And the next to his 4 13 and says that

400
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:17.960
Moses again pleaded Lord, please I love this. Send anyone else anyone else? I don't care who. Just

401
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:24.720
as long as it's not me. I mean of all the people in the world, I'm sure there's somebody else. Why

402
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:33.510
does it have to be me? And and I love the fact that that in that excuse God just keeps reminding

403
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:41.680
Moses Moses. There is no one else that I would rather choose but you. And then when he's saying I'm

404
01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:53.810
not qualified, God is saying I am qualifying you by choosing you. I qualified you. And I think of

405
01:04:53.820 --> 01:05:00.810
Matthew who was still collecting taxes behind this table. You remember that Jesus walks up to him

406
01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:07.170
and he calls him and he says Matthew follow me now Matthew was rich, he was loaded by the way like

407
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:11.530
he had a lot of money because he was a tax collector and we know that because we know how rich

408
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:17.510
Zacchaeus was and tax collectors, one of the wealthiest people in the town. So when he calls him to

409
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:27.480
leave, like he's leaving a lot behind. But what Matthew does is very surprising. But what's more

410
01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:34.690
surprising is that Jesus chooses someone like Matthew, don't you agree? Because Matthew didn't leave

411
01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:41.830
his tax collecting tabled and started following Jesus around, said Jesus choose me, Take me, I'll be

412
01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:48.360
one of your apostles. Jesus goes up to Matthew while he's still collecting taxes. He hasn't changed

413
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.590
yet guys, he hasn't left his profession, he's still cheating people and he's still working for the

414
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:59.340
Roman empire, He's still hated by every jew in that town, nothing's changed. But what God does is

415
01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:08.420
that he walks up to Matthew and he says in the state that you're still in, I qualify you to follow

416
01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:14.730
me. Can we say amen to that? I mean is this a story just about Moses or is this story for every

417
01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:21.630
single person in the scriptures, including us. See every time we think that we aren't good enough,

418
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.550
every time we think we don't have the answers. Every time we think we're not a leader. Every time we

419
01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:32.720
think we're not a public speaker. Every time we think that we are not qualified God is saying I can

420
01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:43.880
change all that for you. And so he didn't take Moses excuses and he's not accepting ours either. And

421
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:51.560
so in this moment we have an incredible opportunity to step out into the power and purpose of our

422
01:06:51.560 --> 01:07:01.470
lives the way that God has called us to live it. Are you ready to do that? Would you stand with me

423
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.160
as we would close in a word of prayer

424
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:13.200
as you would take this opportunity to thank God for someone like Moses that teaches us about what it

425
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:22.180
looks like to have excuses and some pretty darn good ones and how God will ignore every one of them

426
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:29.490
because he is able to move us out of our past and into our future. We're ready to experience that

427
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:35.320
father. I thank you for every person that is here for what you've done for what you're about to do

428
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.450
for the great things that you're going to accomplish in their lives for the excuses that you are

429
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:49.330
challenging for the words that we say to ourselves to convince ourselves that we cannot and yet you

430
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:58.320
remind us that we can with you that you with us in us and working through us is exactly what we all

431
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:05.060
need. And I thank you for every person here today for the way that you are enabling us to revisit

432
01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:12.560
our past. But also Lord to be reminded of the incredible future that you have for us. If you can do

433
01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:21.130
that for Moses you can do that for us and you are able and ready to do it for each of us today.

434
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:29.990
Thank you as we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I pray that blesses you guys. I hope that

435
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:37.700
