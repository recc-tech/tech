praise God

22
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:31.559
as we sing this next song, let's thank God for the, the the opportunity to actually rest on him and

23
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:39.559
build our life on him because he's our firm foundation and let our prayer this morning be Lord.

24
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:45.440
Please be my firm foundation. Please be foundation on which I built everything in my life

25
00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:09.659
worthy of every song we could ever sing.

26
00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:15.849
Whether for the praise we could have

27
00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:35.250
Jesus. The name

28
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.390

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.729

Yeah.

00:15:46.109 --> 00:15:46.880

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.210

38
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.359

39
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:11.690
Wow.

40
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.260
In with,

41
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.500
let us be our prayer as we sing it one last time. Let it be our prayer that God, we wanna build our

42
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.729
foundation of our lives on you.

43
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.479
Yeah.

44
00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:01.219
This next song is me on your mind. We did it first, last Easter and I wanted to just bring it back

45
00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:06.599
again. It's got such beautiful words. Let's listen to these words as we sing it together. Me on your

46
00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:07.079
mind.

47
00:20:17.969 --> 00:20:23.890
No. And how you leave.

48
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.810
I was written with me on a man

49
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.969
in the pro

50
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.770
You.

51
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.699
K to meet him. Did you sit down with me on

52
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:01.939
and the key

53
00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.449
one single,

54
00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:08.180
broken

55
00:21:12.949 --> 00:21:16.699
oh Gray swipes the tears from my face and says

56
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:19.739

It just,

61
00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:50.579
it's

62
00:22:01.459 --> 00:22:05.390
of the we give one single.

63
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.660
Paid the price.

64
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:27.300
Yeah,

65
00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:34.280
sweet.

66
00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:48.000
It was me on your

67
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.959
because I read in

68
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.989
of the heavenly home of

69
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.489
What

70
00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:22.420
of the world again? Was

71
00:23:30.739 --> 00:23:33.599
Grace swipes the tea face.

72
00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:40.329
Yeah.

73
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:44.510
See

74
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.390
for me, I

75
00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:52.310
was me,

76
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.239
me.

77
00:24:55.119 --> 00:25:01.469
So for the kids, you are all ready to go to the Sunday school. So if you can head towards the back,

78
00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:09.189
that'd be awesome. And I'm sure the teachers are excited to see each and every one of you. Um Also

79
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:17.050
starting this week for the announcements, we have our Alpha course being led by uh Pastor Lorenzo on

80
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:24.680
a Saturday, April 22nd at 10 AM. And if you're wondering what Alpha is, we'll just watch this short

81
00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:25.199
video

82
00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:34.489
so much to fit in.

83
00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:47.030
But do you ever stop and think, what's the point of it all? Do you ever ask yourself? Is there more

84
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.949
to life than this?

85
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.650
Alpha is a series of sessions exploring life, faith and meaning. It's a space to explore the big

86
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.189
questions to say what you think and hear other people's points of view.

87
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.050
First up there's food, then a talk followed by a discussion.

88
00:26:14.829 --> 00:26:20.000
Each talk explores a different aspect of the Christian faith. And then in the small group, you get

89
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.719
to say exactly what you think

90
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.369
the aim of the talk is to spark conversation each week. Unpacking a different question.

91
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.099
There's no obligation to say anything and there's nothing you can't say seriously.

92
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.859
It's an opportunity to hear from others and contribute your own perspective in an honest, friendly

93
00:26:46.869 --> 00:26:49.089
and open environment. Why not try it out?

94
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.449
Yeah. So that's, that's uh that's what the Alpha course is mainly. It's again led by Pastor Lorenzo

95
00:27:02.459 --> 00:27:07.209
with a team of volunteers. And it's a great opportunity to bring, bring people that you think might

96
00:27:07.219 --> 00:27:12.430
benefit from it also, if that's something that you were interested in, but you cannot make it.

97
00:27:12.439 --> 00:27:17.489
Unfortunately, we always have our belong groups happening throughout the week. So one of the big

98
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:23.819
ones that we have is actually happens here at River's Edge at seven pm on Wednesdays. So you are

99
00:27:23.829 --> 00:27:30.800
welcome to come to that and bring friends family, whoever, whoever you want to invite. I also want

100
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:38.010
to add that next uh on the 23rd. So yeah, next Sunday, we have our community kitchen brunch

101
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:44.270
organized by our very own community kitchen. I am very excited for that. Their food is always on

102
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:53.060
point. Very good. And uh yeah, we are also always looking for people to help out and volunteer for

103
00:27:53.069 --> 00:27:57.599
different of our ministries. So if that's something you're interested to, you can always speak to

104
00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:02.530
anyone on staff and we, we will be willing to guide you in the right way. And if that's not

105
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:08.349
something that you are willing to do, we always have four different ways to give. And so with that

106
00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:14.890
said, I would like to invite Pastor Lorenzo out so that he can bless us with his word today. Thank

107
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.199
you.

108
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:35.890
While we turned away from him, he turned his heart toward us. While we chased after selfish desires,

109
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:44.680
he chased after us, while we made excuses for our misguided choices, pursuing an elusive sense of

110
00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:53.849
fulfillment. He emptied himself to take the form of a servant, this unthinkable inequity. Our

111
00:28:53.859 --> 00:29:03.160
creator clothed in flesh and weakness for the sake of those clothed in inequity. While we were lost

112
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:11.630
and alone, he became a path for us. While we embraced the comfort of falsehood, he embraced us and

113
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:20.189
showed us truth. While we were eclipsed in shadow, our spirits broken and dying, he became life and

114
00:29:20.199 --> 00:29:30.079
light to all our shepherd, our teacher, our savior and king. And when it seemed, the world had given

115
00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:37.780
up, he gave up everything at just the right time. When we were powerless, he displayed his power and

116
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:45.670
purpose. While we stood accused, he accepted the accusation, he endured the humiliation and the

117
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:52.869
untold suffering of crucifixion. For while we were still sinners. Christ died for us.

118
00:29:58.339 --> 00:30:06.329
Not because we deserved it far from it, but because there has never been a greater love than the

119
00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:17.589
love of Jesus. Today. If you feel hopeless, he gives hope unconditionally. If you've been rejected,

120
00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:24.449
he accepts you completely. If your burdens weigh heavy, lay your fears and failures at the foot of

121
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:33.880
the cross for his blood has erased them entirely. No longer a slave but an heir of salvation. You

122
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:41.670
are his child is chosen, you are his beloved.

123
00:30:51.729 --> 00:30:57.619
That's awesome. Well, I hope you already believe that or are coming to believe that in your own

124
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:03.979
spiritual journey. And as we find ourselves the Sunday after Easter, one of the things that a lot of

125
00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:11.900
churches do is they don't continue to talk about Easter the Sunday after, except we do that here.

126
00:31:12.229 --> 00:31:17.900
And the reason we do that here is because the story doesn't end with the resurrection. There are

127
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:25.459
things that happen after that story and there are people who still need to be reached and spoken to

128
00:31:25.569 --> 00:31:34.209
and better understand what it means to live in the knowledge and the experience of the resurrection.

129
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:42.770
And so today, as we talk about this continuation of that Easter story, we're going to see that we're

130
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:51.459
all on an unexpected road trip with Jesus. It's not something that any of us may have planned and

131
00:31:51.469 --> 00:31:57.920
it's not something that you would have envisioned, but it is something that all of us, whether we

132
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:07.430
come to that realization or not. We eventually do. I believe that but not always in the moment that

133
00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:14.500
we have been journeying with Jesus longer than we ever fully grasped. And that's what happens in

134
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:22.000
this story. And so let's take a look as we talk about this unexpected road trip that's found in Luke

135
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:30.209
chapter 24 beginning at verse 13. And it says that that same day that two of Jesus's followers were

136
00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:39.079
walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem. And as they walked along, they were

137
00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:47.239
talking about everything that had happened. And then they talked and they discussed these things and

138
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:53.510
in the original language, when it says, uh talked and discussed, it actually means that they tossed

139
00:32:53.520 --> 00:33:02.910
about words that were actually arguing. And so Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with

140
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:12.140
them, but God kept them from recognizing him. And he asked them, what are you discussing so intently

141
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:19.689
as you walk along? And they stopped short, sadness written across their faces. And one of them

142
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:32.310
who historically, people believe in, in most of the Christian traditions that he was actually the

143
00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:41.709
uncle of Jesus. You must be the only person in all of Jerusalem who hasn't heard about the things

144
00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:49.199
that have happened there the last few days, what things Jesus asked the things that happened to

145
00:33:49.209 --> 00:33:57.119
Jesus, the man from Nazareth. They said he was a prophet who did powerful miracles and he was a

146
00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:03.479
mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people. But our leading priests and other religious

147
00:34:03.489 --> 00:34:10.379
leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and they crucified him. And we had hoped he was the

148
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:18.909
Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. This all happened three days ago. And then some women from

149
00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:24.949
our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning and they came back with an amazing

150
00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:33.560
report, they said his body was missing and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive, but

151
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:47.830
yet they leave, but yet they leave, they didn't stay to find out. And I think that's important. Some

152
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:54.479
of our men even ran out to sea and sure enough, his body was gone just as the women had said. And

153
00:34:54.489 --> 00:35:00.639
then Jesus said to them, you foolish people, you find it so hard to believe all that the prophets

154
00:35:00.649 --> 00:35:09.330
wrote in the scriptures. Wasn't it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these

155
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:17.580
things before entering his glory. And then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the

156
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:26.560
prophets explaining from all the scriptures, the things concerning himself. And remember they had

157
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:35.850
seven miles and by this time, they were nearing Emmaus. And at the end of their journey, Jesus acted

158
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:46.479
as if he was going to continue walking, going on, but they begged him stay the night with us since

159
00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:54.679
it is getting late and so upon their invitation, he went home with them. And as they sat down to eat,

160
00:35:55.169 --> 00:36:05.399
he then does something that is familiar in other parts of the scriptures. He took the bread, he

161
00:36:05.409 --> 00:36:17.419
blessed it, he broke it and then he gave it to them and suddenly their eyes were opened and they

162
00:36:17.429 --> 00:36:20.459
recognized him and at the moment

163
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:31.709
he disappeared, he was gone just like that. Nowhere to be found. And then they said to each other,

164
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:40.330
didn't our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road. And he explained the scriptures

165
00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:47.810
to us. And they're referring to what happens when the Holy Spirit begins to do a work in our lives

166
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:55.739
when our hearts are being touched and our eyes are beginning to finally see the very things that are

167
00:36:55.750 --> 00:37:10.020
being described. And within the hour, they were back to Jerusalem, they made their way back, They

168
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:19.989
didn't stay in the mass, they didn't stay home, they went back and they found the 11 disciples

169
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:28.709
because Judas is no longer with them and the others who had gathered with them, who said the Lord

170
00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:37.149
has really risen? Can we say amen to the reading of his word? It's a beautiful story, isn't it? And

171
00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:44.620
it gives us some insight in what can happen, not just in the life of the disciples who had a

172
00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:51.350
powerful experience with Jesus. But what can also happen in our own lives when we're not

173
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:58.750
understanding how God is at work. You see the first thing that we noticed in this story is that they

174
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:05.100
actually were able to leave Jerusalem and Jesus behind. And you can tell by their contentious

175
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:14.290
argument on the road that what they are doing is that he is doing what you would expect to happen in

176
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:20.080
a moment like this where there is such confusion. They have heard the reports, they have heard the

177
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:25.870
news, but yet it isn't enough to convince them. And I think sometimes in our own spiritual journey,

178
00:38:25.879 --> 00:38:34.090
we're like that, we're just not totally convinced we've had experiences we want to believe. But

179
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:40.959
there just isn't enough to hook us. There isn't enough to convince us, there isn't enough there for

180
00:38:40.969 --> 00:38:47.919
us to feel like we've got this. We understand this. I'm never turning back on this. I am never going

181
00:38:47.929 --> 00:38:58.250
to leave Jesus like others have. And yet in this story, we see that it is possible to have direct

182
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:07.419
access to Jesus just like they did and even direct access to the 11 to the 11 who had seen it all

183
00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:14.469
who had experienced it first hand for 3.5 years, they had imminent knowledge and experience, they

184
00:39:14.479 --> 00:39:19.810
had had the scriptures explained to them before. And yet in spite of the fact that they had had all

185
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:28.110
these experiences, they still leave Jerusalem and Jesus behind. I don't know if you've ever at some

186
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:35.510
point left Jesus behind, he just decided that he wasn't worth it and that everything that you

187
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:42.729
believe for whatever reason just wasn't going to be enough that Jesus wasn't going to be enough that

188
00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:51.790
what you had experienced wasn't enough and you made the decision to move on. This is exactly what's

189
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:58.060
happening in this story. They had hoped that Jesus was the Messiah, but then Jesus presented himself

190
00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:04.590
in a way that they couldn't accept. You see the thing that bothers so many is the fact that the

191
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:11.110
messiah suffered, the, the fact that Jesus suffered, the fact that God would send a suffering

192
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:18.270
servant. But but when you understand who God is throughout the scriptures, you understand that He is

193
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:26.070
distinct and different from every other God in any other religion, in that He is the only God who

194
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:36.429
allows himself to suffer. See God suffers so that we would understand that this is a suffering God

195
00:40:36.439 --> 00:40:43.629
who understands our suffering. We don't need a God who doesn't understand our suffering. We need a

196
00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:51.530
God who is compassionate, merciful and cares about our suffering. And what God does is that he shows

197
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:58.199
himself as the suffering messiah. So that we would understand that no matter what it is that we are

198
00:40:58.209 --> 00:41:07.909
going through in this life. Jesus Christ is the only one who can take away our suffering because

199
00:41:07.919 --> 00:41:14.659
He's the only one who experienced that, who knows it and understands it. There's no other God in the

200
00:41:14.669 --> 00:41:20.889
world who suffered like Jesus did. There's no other God in the world who would send his son to

201
00:41:20.899 --> 00:41:27.790
suffer like Jesus did. There's no other God in any other world that would ever do anything in this

202
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:35.340
world like Jesus did. And that's why when we think about this, we say this has gotta be one of the

203
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:42.689
things that convinces us, one of the things that makes this true, one of the things that makes it

204
00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:48.969
different than anything else. And we know that they're struggling with this because they're no

205
00:41:48.979 --> 00:41:57.080
longer seeing him as the messiah. You see, there's a point where they call him prophet. They

206
00:41:58.189 --> 00:42:05.449
relegate him to a lower designation. And that's what other people do too, in other faiths and other

207
00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:13.550
religions. They recognize who Jesus was in this world, both as a historical and as a spiritual

208
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:23.520
figure. They do. They get it. But here's what they don't get is that he doesn't just come as a

209
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:32.550
prophet. He comes as the promised king. You see, prophet is just one of his titles. Prophet is just

210
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:40.889
one of the prophecies regarding who he is. It isn't the only one. And so when you designate someone,

211
00:42:40.899 --> 00:42:49.020
a prophet, you're showing them honor and respect, but you're not able to consider that they are more.

212
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:57.939
And so you box Jesus in into a place in your spiritual journey that is convenient for you. And now

213
00:42:57.949 --> 00:43:06.610
I'm wondering where is it in your life that Jesus is occupying a specific box and place in your

214
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:14.959
spiritual journey? I mean, is he truly the messiah? Is he the risen king or is he just a prophet?

215
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:25.110
And sometimes I live my life every day like he is just a good teacher that he has good morals that

216
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:31.750
if I was to put into practice what it means to truly love my neighbor and put myself out there and

217
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:39.530
love people the way that he wants me to, then Jesus is only not a prophet, but if I want him to be

218
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:47.030
more than a prophet, then I need to see him as the one who was raised from the dead. And in that

219
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:56.399
power is able to live in us in a way that he can bring about a new life in all phases of our life.

220
00:43:56.409 --> 00:44:04.919
Not just in the areas where we work hard, where we are committed to coaching, where we are dedicated

221
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:12.129
to being mentored, where we are applying ourselves to increase our knowledge, where we are studying

222
00:44:12.139 --> 00:44:19.939
so that we can have breakthroughs. But when we get to a place where you see Jesus as more than just

223
00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:28.040
a knowledge factory and more than just someone who did good deeds, someone who may have performed

224
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:35.620
miracles or maybe they're just allegories and maybe just metaphors and maybe they're just stories

225
00:44:35.629 --> 00:44:42.679
and they're just examples to help us believe in something other than that, which is material that,

226
00:44:42.689 --> 00:44:50.020
which can only be solved scientifically, that can only be resolved intellectually. Then we might

227
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:57.649
come to the place where we realize that the supernatural is always not just a part of Jesus, but

228
00:44:57.659 --> 00:45:04.929
it's always a part of our lives that just because our eyes are not open to see it, it doesn't mean

229
00:45:04.939 --> 00:45:12.520
that it isn't there on the day in which Jesus had already risen from the dead. They were arguing

230
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:20.570
still about how they couldn't believe that he had. You see, sometimes that happens to us, we get

231
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:28.679
lost and stuck because we have put Jesus into a category where he is just a prophet. The Messiah

232
00:45:28.689 --> 00:45:34.729
couldn't have been crucified and died. That's not how we were taught. That's not what we understand.

233
00:45:34.959 --> 00:45:42.469
That's not what we believed. That's not what we ushered him into Jerusalem. For the Messiah wouldn't

234
00:45:42.479 --> 00:45:51.159
have been the scandalous one. He wouldn't have experienced the excruciating and scandalous death on

235
00:45:51.169 --> 00:45:59.320
the cross. That's not for our Messiah. That's not the way we prove to the world that we are God's

236
00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:06.939
people, not through someone who dies on the cross. But remember that God prophesized these things

237
00:46:06.949 --> 00:46:15.189
through his own people. He told them that the suffering of the Messiah would have to come. He told

238
00:46:15.199 --> 00:46:22.000
them that that was the only way that he could communicate to the world that someone had to become

239
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:29.949
the last sacrifice that the temple and everything that would be offered on the altar would one day

240
00:46:29.959 --> 00:46:39.010
be replaced by the spotless lamb of God. That lamb is Jesus Christ. And his death is what made it

241
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:49.270
possible for all of us to have our sins taken away, not just one time a year, not just when the

242
00:46:49.280 --> 00:47:01.919
temple would one day be restored and the sacrifices resumed. But right now in this moment by putting

243
00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:13.080
our faith and trust in Jesus, you see Jesus comes unrecognized among the lost and this is how, you

244
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:18.550
know you're lost when you can't recognize who Jesus is, I don't wanna offend anyone here because I

245
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.500
too was lost

246
00:47:21.689 --> 00:47:27.879
and I don't think I liked hearing the words. The reason you don't believe is because you're lost.

247
00:47:28.899 --> 00:47:38.209
And then it was ok because the time finally came when I too experienced what it's like for God to

248
00:47:38.219 --> 00:47:49.370
open my eyes. And now I proudly say I once was lost. But now I'm found, I don't have a problem with

249
00:47:49.379 --> 00:47:57.020
someone telling me that sometimes even today, I can lose my way. I don't like it when someone feels

250
00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:03.830
superior to me and points out my shortcomings and tells me where it is that I'm not measuring up. I

251
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.520
don't like it when someone reveals to me the Brokenness that is still present in my life. I don't

252
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:16.379
like it when they tell me where I am falling short. I don't like being lost. But now I understand

253
00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:23.419
when, when that happens, it's because God still wants me to be found. And in the area of my life

254
00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:31.100
where I am lost, he wants to do a work in me. And if I will humble myself, God can do that work and

255
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:36.169
he will use anyone and anything to bring it to my attention. And so

256
00:48:38.469 --> 00:48:46.159
Jesus is always unrecognized among the lost. But here's the beautiful thing is that the, the mercy

257
00:48:46.879 --> 00:48:58.360
of God coming to them is revealed because Jesus reveals the mercy of God by coming to the two people

258
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:05.889
who left Jerusalem and Jesus behind. See Jesus shows up to the people that rejected him.

259
00:49:08.489 --> 00:49:16.360
He shows up to the ones who are leaving him behind. They've already made the decision that he was

260
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:21.409
not the promised one that he's not the Messiah, that he's not the one that they had been seeking and

261
00:49:21.419 --> 00:49:30.080
waiting for. And so they left and who does God go to? He goes to the ones that leave him? Can we say

262
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:37.810
amen to that? Can, can you, can you get that, that, that you were that person that Jesus came to

263
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:46.719
find you? And then he walked with us and, and, and we didn't recognize Him. You see the good

264
00:49:46.729 --> 00:49:57.159
shepherd goes after the one we sing this. We've heard this, we've read this and some of us have come

265
00:49:57.169 --> 00:50:04.540
to believe it and understand it. And so he talks about how He has 100 sheep, but the good shepherd

266
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:10.600
leaves the 99 behind to go after the one that is lost. He doesn't just protect the 99 but he goes

267
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.500
after the one

268
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:20.179
and that tells us that there isn't anyone who isn't important to God. I know it looks irresponsible

269
00:50:20.189 --> 00:50:25.929
when you leave 99. But you see when you're the good shepherd, you have made provision to protect the

270
00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:31.780
99 when you go out for the one. See, when you're the good shepherd, you don't have to worry about

271
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:39.780
the 99 because God's heart and concern isn't that He is incapable of caring for the 99 his heart and

272
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:47.639
concern is that there is one who's about to be lost. And so our mind says it's irresponsible to

273
00:50:47.649 --> 00:50:54.110
leave the 99. Forget about the one. Let them have their experiences. Let them go and knock up

274
00:50:54.120 --> 00:51:00.689
against every barrier and every boundary. Let them experience all the Brokenness in this world. Let

275
00:51:00.699 --> 00:51:07.110
them get hurt as much as they possibly can. Let them hit rock bottom. Let them be in a place where

276
00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:14.489
they can finally realize how far they are from the blessing that is God. And then maybe they're

277
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.350
going to come back to him. But you know what God does.

278
00:51:19.379 --> 00:51:29.419
He walks among the lost every day. You see the story of a man is so powerful because there's never a

279
00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:31.560
moment that he's not with us.

280
00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.949
There's never a moment. He's not walking with us. The lost. Do you see that?

281
00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:50.189
And he's doing everything to reveal and open our eyes to understand who He is in. The journey that

282
00:51:50.199 --> 00:52:04.580
we're on those seven miles represent a perfect number that is seven. The number seven in the Bible

283
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:16.429
speaks of a covenant. A covenant goes beyond a contract. A covenant can never be broken. It is on to

284
00:52:16.439 --> 00:52:25.709
death. Contracts can be broken and you can continue to live, but covenant cannot be broken. The only

285
00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:34.399
result if you break a covenant is that, see, when God speaks of a covenant with his people he's

286
00:52:34.409 --> 00:52:37.510
saying I am with you always,

287
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:45.729
there will never be a moment when I am not with you. And so think about how Jesus isn't just with

288
00:52:45.739 --> 00:52:53.330
those who believe, why isn't he in Jerusalem? With those who are already convinced? Why isn't he

289
00:52:53.340 --> 00:53:02.500
with those that already believe and already forming the church? Where is Jesus? Jesus is with the

290
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:12.060
lost. Jesus is with the lost now, Jesus can be everywhere but he is with the loss and why is he with

291
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:18.590
them? He wants them to find their way back to faith. And when you find your way back to faith,

292
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:27.080
here's what happens. You end up back in Jerusalem, you band up in the city of God, you're back where

293
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:34.739
you need to be the center of where faith exists. See Jerusalem is a representation of the presence

294
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:40.550
of God and it's a representation of what it means to be in a covenant relationship. It represents

295
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:46.899
where the church was going to be, where it was going to be birthed from all the acts of the apostles

296
00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:53.199
are going to take place first in Jerusalem and then they're going to expand to other regions of the

297
00:53:53.209 --> 00:54:00.610
earth. But before that can happen, the church needs to gather everyone who has had an experience of

298
00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:08.379
having been reached even though they've been lost. Listen, if you feel lost today, I want you to

299
00:54:08.389 --> 00:54:17.080
know that Jesus is walking with, you always has always will because he has made a covenant with you

300
00:54:18.449 --> 00:54:27.100
and that covenant cannot be broken. It will not be broken. He's gonna pursue you into every city you

301
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:36.229
go no matter how far you go, he will go with you wherever it is that you decide to go, he is going

302
00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:44.239
to come to you and walk with you. And he's gonna be on this unexpected road trip with you. This one

303
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:52.000
that is their journey to faith and experiencing his favor again. And you need to see that on this

304
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:58.580
day, Jesus is already resurrected and they're talking about it, aren't they? It's hard to find

305
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:04.020
someone who hasn't heard that Jesus has risen from the dead. True, not true. I think most people

306
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:10.070
have heard it. I think we've done a good job of getting that message out. I think we haven't failed

307
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.620
in that, but I think we failed in living the power of the resurrection. I think we failed in being

308
00:55:16.629 --> 00:55:22.419
good examples as followers of Christ. I think we failed in being a church that is a reflection of

309
00:55:22.429 --> 00:55:28.620
who Jesus is. I think we failed as leaders and failed as pastors and failed as, as just followers of

310
00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:35.840
Jesus in this regard. But I think that most people today have heard this message just like they did,

311
00:55:36.689 --> 00:55:42.409
but it wasn't enough to convince them. You see, we just had Easter and the convinced gathered and

312
00:55:42.419 --> 00:55:50.060
said he has risen. But there's a lot of people who don't believe that He is still today. And we need

313
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:58.889
to understand that Jesus is just as interested in us as he is in them. And thank God because

314
00:55:58.899 --> 00:56:06.679
otherwise we would never be here today. We would never be in this place. And so whenever we think

315
00:56:06.689 --> 00:56:16.229
that we're better, we're more, we're higher and others are lost and lower and lesser, then we need

316
00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:22.989
to understand that that is never true because we see Jesus purposely journeying with those who are

317
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:32.360
lost and opening the scriptures to them so that they too can be found. And so Jesus is resurrected

318
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:39.300
on a day in which they still are struggling to believe it. And we exist for that as a church, we

319
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:47.679
exist as that people who have believed in him as people who want to receive others into our

320
00:56:47.689 --> 00:56:54.379
spiritual journey to help them have that same experience. And I love that they continue reflecting

321
00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:04.360
on the past, that is no longer the present reality. And I think what happens is that we get stuck

322
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:10.770
there. We get stuck in the past. Have you ever been stuck in the past? Have you ever struggled to

323
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:22.719
get over? Something I even saw wrought by tragedy and trauma that is just hard to get over. I think

324
00:57:22.729 --> 00:57:29.330
we all have. And I think there are some things in our lives that are deeply rooted and it takes a

325
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:38.260
little more time to uproot them, to tear them out. So they no longer have the strength they once did

326
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:48.010
in our lives. So that whenever they do appear again, I want you to think of it. Like the analogy of

327
00:57:48.939 --> 00:57:57.989
the weeds that Jesus spoke about and he says that sometimes his word like seeds is sown and it's

328
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:06.050
sown among the weeds and the tears and, and there are times when the weeds choke out the good wheat,

329
00:58:07.899 --> 00:58:14.959
the fruit that God wants it to bear in our lives. But there are too many weeds there. The weeds are

330
00:58:14.969 --> 00:58:22.280
a reflection of the things that choke out the promises of God and the freedom that He has for us.

331
00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:29.739
It's a reflection of the past and the things that hold us back from experiencing new things and

332
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:35.620
having the kind of harvest that God wants you to have in your life. When you, when you think about

333
00:58:35.629 --> 00:58:47.489
your desires, when you call them your wishes, when you speak of them as your hopes and your dreams,

334
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:58.469
God calls that His favor. He calls that His blessing. But what happens is that the weeds in our life

335
00:58:58.479 --> 00:59:05.600
choke those things out from ever being able to take root and to grow. I want you to look at your

336
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:12.709
life differently today. I want you to examine your past and see it for what it is

337
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:25.209
and acknowledge whether or not there are weeds there that are choking out the blessing of God.

338
00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:38.409
And when you see those weeds, I want you to identify what that weed is called because weed is just a

339
00:59:38.419 --> 00:59:49.590
general term to describe something that is invasive and a foreign to what is supposed to be there to

340
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:56.939
what is supposed to grow. But if you cannot name that weed, there is no way that you're going to be

341
00:59:56.949 --> 00:59:59.120
able to uproot the wheat.

342
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:10.929
And when you uproot the reed, it is because God has opened your eyes to see it for what it is. And

343
01:00:10.939 --> 01:00:18.820
what Jesus does for these two travelers on this unexpected road trip is that he opens the scriptures

344
01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:28.879
and he spends the next seven miles showing them the difference between weeds and wheat.

345
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:40.870
And he exposes the weeds in their life so that they can finally get to the place where the wheat can

346
01:00:40.879 --> 01:00:51.770
grow healthy and produce the grain that will give them the bread that Jesus is then able to bless

347
01:00:51.780 --> 01:01:02.479
and to break and to feed them with that cannot happen unless we identify the weeds that are choking

348
01:01:02.489 --> 01:01:10.780
out the wheat that produces the bread that Jesus wants to bless and break and bring multiplication

349
01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.419
into our lives. Are you ready for that?

350
01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:23.229
We have got to stop being choked out by the weeds.

351
01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:32.649
We have to stop allowing the weeds to devastate our harvest.

352
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:44.139
We have to stop allowing the weeds to overtake the wheat that God has sown into our lives. And don't

353
01:01:44.149 --> 01:01:46.500
tell me you're gluten free because this is not the point.

354
01:01:49.419 --> 01:01:57.469
And you've given up wheat and bread and all the rest, we know that wheat is no longer the same. But

355
01:01:57.479 --> 01:01:59.469
let's just get past that for a moment.

356
01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:12.360
See, they can't see that he's alive. They can't see you because their eyes won't be opened. But the

357
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:20.360
only way our eyes can be opened if we stop believing our lies and we start believing his scriptures.

358
01:02:21.709 --> 01:02:28.219
See Jesus took the scriptures to open their eyes and, and, and I'm, and I mean, he had to take them

359
01:02:28.229 --> 01:02:34.050
through it. Listen, when I started to study the scriptures, I began to understand my eyes began to

360
01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:41.820
open all of a sudden every way that I was lost. I started to see why and, and how I could be found.

361
01:02:42.949 --> 01:02:50.629
But it wasn't because I found my way out of it. It was because God had already given me the way out

362
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.689
and I just needed to see it.

363
01:02:55.870 --> 01:03:03.739
You know, we keep looking for a way out when the scriptures already reveal the way out and, and, and

364
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:10.459
when we understand how the scriptures are key in finding the way out. Well, then we are going to see

365
01:03:10.469 --> 01:03:16.919
that Jesus is already resurrected. We're gonna be able to start understanding that. And that's what

366
01:03:16.929 --> 01:03:28.209
happened for those two lost disciples. They began to see it. They began to reflect and understand

367
01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:37.290
that Jesus was alive. And when Jesus opens the scriptures to us, well, he enters and he breaks and

368
01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:44.639
he blesses, but he can only do that when he's invited. I remember that one point in the story, they

369
01:03:44.649 --> 01:03:46.830
said, stay with us

370
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:54.389
and, and we saw that before they said, stay with us. There was a moment where Jesus was just gonna

371
01:03:54.399 --> 01:03:57.620
keep walking. It's because

372
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:09.110
they neared their home. And then I think that there's this, there's understanding in us that tells

373
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.620
us that there's certain things that to us are home

374
01:04:14.929 --> 01:04:21.419
until we understand that what Jesus wants to do is come into our home

375
01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:31.469
and turn our home into a blessing like never before. And so sometimes we look at wherever it is that

376
01:04:31.479 --> 01:04:39.439
we're heading and that's home. So as they neared Emmaus, that's home. And so in their hearts, they

377
01:04:39.449 --> 01:04:49.479
were going home. And so until they actually said Jesus, stay with me, stay with us, come and eat

378
01:04:49.489 --> 01:05:00.030
with us, it's getting dark be with us until they made that invitation. Jesus now had revealed

379
01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:11.860
himself as their home. See Jesus in revelations 3 20 says that he stands at the door of your heart

380
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:22.239
and he knocks and that unless you open that door and let him in, he cannot enter and have a meal

381
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:33.860
with you. And so the handle on the door that Jesus is knocking on is only on our side.

382
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:48.969
And so unless you open the door on your side, Jesus can't come in. He needs to be invited. And so I

383
01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:56.810
need you to invite him into your heart right now, I need him to invite him into your life, into your

384
01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:04.090
home. I need him to invite him into all the areas of your life where he has been kept out and has

385
01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:12.379
only been in a specific understanding of who Jesus is and what he has meant to you before when you

386
01:06:12.389 --> 01:06:23.030
invite him in. That's when your eyes can be opened. That's when he chooses to show you what you

387
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:30.729
never could have seen before. But it has to happen on your invitation and then through the

388
01:06:30.739 --> 01:06:40.469
scriptures and through the supper of him, taking the bread blessing and breaking it, all of our eyes

389
01:06:40.479 --> 01:06:47.469
can be opened. We can see things like never before have insights that we've never had before.

390
01:06:47.479 --> 01:06:53.379
Experience healing and freedom, like never before. But it's only going to happen through the

391
01:06:53.389 --> 01:07:01.860
scriptures and through the supper. See, the scriptures and the supper are key, the scriptures that

392
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:06.350
teach. But the supper that speaks of the relationship,

393
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:17.370
the scriptures give us the knowledge, but the supper gives us communion. The scriptures speak of the

394
01:07:17.379 --> 01:07:23.550
covenant, but the supper makes the covenant alive.

395
01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:38.159
You see, when you have the scriptures, if you don't have the supper, Jesus can't be alive. But if

396
01:07:38.169 --> 01:07:48.770
you combine the scriptures and the supper, then Jesus is alive for all of us. He is a life for you

397
01:07:49.189 --> 01:07:59.679
and he is a life for me. When those two things are together, Jesus is risen. Indeed. Amen.

398
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:10.889
Jesus is risen. Indeed. And that's what he wants to do for each of us. Would you stand with me as we

399
01:08:10.899 --> 01:08:17.560
close in a word of prayer? I could have said more, but I'm gonna shut my trap. I'm gonna, I'm gonna

400
01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:24.548
end on the applause. I think you're telling me it's a good place to end and here it's good.

401
01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:32.890
And I think that the worship team is gonna come and, and they're just gonna help us just bring this

402
01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:39.919
home and, and help us to connect with God. And, and I pray that together we can experience the

403
01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:47.508
fullness of, of, of what we have heard today and what he's ready to ex ex help us experience in our

404
01:08:47.519 --> 01:08:54.758
everyday lives today. Lord, I thank you for each person that is here and for the way that you have

405
01:08:54.769 --> 01:09:02.389
walked with us or how you keep walking with us that even when we leave Jerusalem for some other

406
01:09:02.398 --> 01:09:10.028
place, oh, you come after us, you appear to us, you journey with us. Thank you for showing us the

407
01:09:10.039 --> 01:09:19.500
scriptures and exposing the weeds and telling us what it looks like God to harvest the wheat that

408
01:09:19.509 --> 01:09:28.199
you have promised. We tried to bring goodness and blessing into our lives only to see us fail time

409
01:09:28.208 --> 01:09:36.959
and time again or to see it just taken away and are devastated by the things of this world. Lord, I

410
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:44.600
pray that every person here today would experience this new found understanding. Of what it looks

411
01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:52.450
like to live in relationship with you through the scriptures and the supper that together. Lord, we

412
01:09:52.459 --> 01:10:05.430
would have the fullness of what it means to be your disciples who believe that you have risen from

413
01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:13.859
the dead. You have risen for each of us. You were alive today for all of us and you are going to

414
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:24.009
bless us. Like never before we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Pray that, that

415
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.049
encourages you.

416
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:34.209
Let's sing together and then um Nate's gonna come back out and dismiss us. I hope to see you guys at

417
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:40.580
the after party. Um There's a few people that I've been seeing here uh week after week and I, I've

418
01:10:40.589 --> 01:10:46.020
been really blessed to see your presence here. Um Some of you, I, I know really well, some of you I

419
01:10:46.029 --> 01:10:50.819
don't, haven't met yet. Would you just take a moment and just come and say hi to me because I would

420
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:57.310
love to say hi to you. I, I just can't always get to you in time. I, I try but sometimes I get, I

421
01:10:57.319 --> 01:11:02.330
get stopped along the way, but even if I'm talking with someone and you're new and I haven't had a

422
01:11:02.339 --> 01:11:09.240
chance to say hi man. Everyone here will tell you that when I get to know you. Um I get to know you

423
01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:14.160
on a first name basis. I remember everybody. I really do. I remember everybody's name. You tell me

424
01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:21.129
anything about your life. I will remember it because I don't just take that introduction lightly

425
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:31.290
and take it lightly that God has brought you into this church by accident. I believe that he's got a

426
01:11:31.299 --> 01:11:38.370
purpose and in the same way that He knows your name, it's my responsibility to know your name

427
01:11:41.049 --> 01:11:50.069
because it's my responsibility to pray for you by name, to love you by name, to encourage you on

428
01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.189
your spiritual journey by name. I want you to know that I take that so seriously all of my heart, it

429
01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.649
means everything to me. And so when you don't say hi to me, I'm really hurt by that.

430
01:12:05.109 --> 01:12:10.910
And I know you may be shy and, and, and, and you may like, just feel like this is good. You know,

431
01:12:10.919 --> 01:12:16.270
nobody knows me here. I'm gonna get a fresh start and I'm just gonna do something here and see what

432
01:12:16.279 --> 01:12:25.379
God does for me here and, but just know this. Um I, I want to enter into community with you and I

433
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:31.160
want you to find community here with each other. The reason we do the after party is so that you

434
01:12:31.169 --> 01:12:35.129
don't just stay in your seat and you come and then you go, but that you get to know people here

435
01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:41.350
because the only reason why people come to church and I'm, and I'm serious about this is because

436
01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:42.330
they find friendship.

437
01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:50.970
I need you to make an effort. Um And the only effort you have to make is just be open to, to, to

438
01:12:50.979 --> 01:12:56.120
that kind of friendship with other people here. You'll see that when you make that kind of

439
01:12:56.129 --> 01:13:04.979
connection, man. Community is amazing. It really is. It changes everything because we were made for

440
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:13.359
community really were. And the church is God's idea, not ours. And so I pray that, um we get to just

441
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:18.740
experience that in, in the days and in the weeks to come. Uh I, I'm sure you've noticed how God has

442
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:23.879
been blessing this church. I'm sure you've noticed how week after week God has been filling it again.

443
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:30.060
Um There was a time when we used to have three services here on a Sunday. I know that God's gonna

444
01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:38.000
bring us back to that point. Not because it's an honor to me or to what we used to have. But because

445
01:13:38.009 --> 01:13:46.240
that's our purpose is to make room for those who have yet to come. It's about making room for those

446
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:52.310
that Jesus is already journeying with and finding space for them. And so it's everyone's

447
01:13:52.319 --> 01:13:59.520
responsibility to make someone else feel welcome here. And if we take that on us, here's what's

448
01:13:59.529 --> 01:14:09.790
gonna happen. This church is gonna be a community. Can we say amen to that? OK. I'm done for real.

449
01:14:09.799 --> 01:14:10.399
OK. See you.

450
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:39.020
I've never tough lifetime fully know your

451
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.509
to know all that you deserve.

452
01:14:47.109 --> 01:14:51.459
Yeah. Yes. All of my depress city.

453
01:14:53.879 --> 01:14:54.299
No.

454
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:58.799
You assume the best of

455
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:11.870
God for saving me. I was we. So I was saying this is how God for

456
01:15:17.459 --> 01:15:30.220
my infection, everything I have to get the sun. My attention is measured in the praise

457
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:41.120
This is how

458
01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:44.049

459
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.959

everything.

468
01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.859
how I dance.

469
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:18.709
