00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:03.430
Welcome to River's Edge. So happy you're here. I'm Kristina. So if you haven't met me, come say hi

8
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.280
to me. I love meeting new people. But yeah, we're just so blessed to have you, if you're in person

9
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.050
or if you're online, we love you and I really believe that you're gonna get something specific today,

10
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:20.090
whatever you need for your heart, God knows and he's gonna give it to you. Um so yeah, we've got a

11
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.190
really great gathering plan today. It's actually super special because we are going to be singing

12
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:31.190
Christmas songs and worshiping. So two of my favorite things. Um and also we're gonna be hearing

13
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.920
another series, another message from the series, joyful expectation and this message has been

14
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.730
blowing my mind. So I'm really excited for it. Um and we also want you to know that you belong

15
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.880
before you believe and that's not just a catchphrase, it's not just something that we say, it's not

16
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.170
just a cliche, we really mean it. Um you don't have to fix yourself to be loved. You don't have to

17
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.100
fix, you know who you are, you can come in in your mess and just be loved as you are, wherever you

18
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.350
are in your spiritual journey you matter and we want you to know you belong. So yeah, All right.

19
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.160
Without further ado, let's welcome the River's Edge worship team. These guys are amazing and let's

20
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.270
stand to our feet also and just posture ourselves in a place of worship and surrender and just

21
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:21.590
expectancy for whatever God's gonna do. Okay, alright, let's sing our first song. We're gonna sing a

22
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:27.920
wonderful fun, exciting, lively song celebrating the birth of Jesus. Let's do this.

28
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I love that song. Now we're gonna take it down a little bit. Woo, catch my breath, too much jumping around.

29
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:03.670
God rest you merry gentlemen is going to be our next beautiful song and nice him to remind us for

30
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.370
Jesus' birthday.

42
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.010
Are you ready to jump up again? Now we're gonna do Angels We Have Heard On High.

47
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:28.140
I want to invite Kathleen, our community kitchen organizer to please come up on stage.

Mm you saw this over it. Thank you. Richard congrats.

65
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:07.700
So I wanted to also take a minute to thank the Community Kitchen volunteers guys since the launch in

66
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:15.450
September. They've been so supportive, encouraging. Um, always bringing ideas meaning on a bi weekly

67
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:22.850
basis on zoom and just going above and beyond. So before I know all of the volunteers, but I don't

68
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:29.150
want to forget one. So I'm gonna ask everybody who contributed to just stand up if you don't mind.

69
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:41.380
Yeah, stand up. Patty, Stephan, stand up. Everybody. Even if you've been in the meeting once or served.

70
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:49.440
Guys, this this is my team of champions. I'm really thankful for them. And uh, this is a blessing to

71
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:57.190

73
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:17.610
team, so thank you again And I wanted to also thank the 100 10th girls Montreal's guide of much of

74
00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:23.860
Montreal, they have been um if you see the donation table, it's full of toys, full of food to hand

75
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.290
out and they've done an amazing job, so I'm really thankful, thank you jenny, you're part of the

76
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:37.030
organization, so thank you so much and I'm looking forward to see you all at noon, we have a great

77
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.150
meal to distribute, so thank you God bless you.

78
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:56.400
Amazing. Okay, well let's just do some announcements before we get into the message. So first things

79
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.550
first yesterday we had a hot chocolate outreach. Um I personally didn't go, but I heard it was

80
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:07.190
amazing. So yeah, we just gave hot chocolate out to passerbys and strangers and apparently it went

81
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:12.320
really well and it was really warm and inviting um and we told them about our Christmas meal, which

82
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.720
is my next point after the service today don't run out, I mean you can, but we still love you, but

83
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:24.910
if you stay, we have a meal at the back and it's gonna be really exciting um and I find that

84
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:30.870
connecting over food is such a beautiful way to build community and just get to know people and so

85
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.210
it's actually really nice to be able to do that um in the service with people after, you know,

86
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:40.460
people who maybe you haven't known or haven't seen so stay after grab the meal and you can take it

87
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:47.150
to go if you need to or you can eat it here. Um next thing is our Christmas eve service. So

88
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.520
Christmas eve we are having a live in person gathering um it's gonna be one hour, it's on December

89
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.820
24th at five p.m. So that's on the Saturday and uh yeah we'd love for you guys to attend, it's gonna

90
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.350
be really great and you can invite someone to, this is always a great time of year to bring someone

91
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:09.750
to church who maybe has never been, people are looking for a service to go to. So yeah we'd love for

92
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:17.050
you guys to come. Um the next one is really important Christmas day and New Year's Day, I did not

93
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:24.500
know this fun fact but um we actually um how do I say this? So every seven years Christmas day and

94
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:31.430
Christmas or a New Year's Day fall on a Sunday and that happened this year so we are not having an

95
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:38.220
in person gathering on those days so don't show up because it would be awkward, no one's here um and

96
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.800
but we are having online we're having online gatherings to do that instead and it's gonna be really

97
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.420
nice, you can get cozy, you can invite your friends and family, we know how to get cozy, we did it

98
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.420
all throughout the pandemic and nothing else to do. So, um yeah, come to those services, we'd love

99
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.220
to have you. It's gonna be really great. And then um I want to just thank you guys for your giving.

100
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.780
We have four ways to give, they're gonna show up on the screen here. Um but yeah, just choose the

101
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.360
best way that works for you and honestly any amount counts your generosity, It just doesn't go

102
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:14.890
unnoticed. God sees it. We appreciate it. Um so yeah, we've got lots of different ways to give up

103
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:20.360
there. Okay, so now I'm going to dismiss the kids so kids, you can head on back to the annex and

104
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.600
don't forget to use the check in and we're gonna watch a little video about that as well.

105
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.750
Okay, we've got one more video to watch. Um let's prepare our hearts for the message today. I'm

106
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:12.900
super excited for it. Pastor Zo's gonna talk about overcoming fear. So let's watch this video.

107
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.980
Awesome. Well welcome everyone. We're so glad that you could be with us and we're hoping and praying

108
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:25.430
that this would be a special and meaningful season for you in your life and we're so proud of our

109
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.400
community kitchen team, The hard work that they have put in to making each event so incredibly

110
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:38.330
successful and helping us, especially after a very long pandemic season to experience community

111
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:46.310
again. And so one of the ways that we really wanted to offer community was around a table a meal,

112
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.920
and that's exactly what we've been doing on a monthly basis and we're looking forward to being able

113
00:30:51.920 --> 00:31:00.570
to share with you some new plans and a new vision for the new year in the weeks to come. And so once

114
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:07.240
we've gotten past our next two gatherings and we come back in the second week of January, we'll be

115
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:13.770
able to share more about what's going to be coming up in the new year. I know we always have

116
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:23.180
incredible expectations about what this season can bring. And sometimes we live with a sense of

117
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:32.030
unfortunate disappointment and I think that we can get into routines about life and the way that we

118
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:42.840
live it and then not expect anything other than what we have been experiencing already, and that

119
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:50.710
would be our mistake because as people of faith, we need to have a joyful expectation. God is a God

120
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:57.490
who is always willing and ready to do something new in our lives and when it looks like we've

121
00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:05.920
reached an end, God is saying, no, you don't understand, this is just another moment and another

122
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:16.970
opportunity for me to point you towards a new beginning. Behold, he says, I am always doing anything.

123
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.960
I think if we understand that about God, then we can always have in our hearts and in our lives a

124
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:31.590
joyful expectation, no matter what kind of season, we're in the story that we're looking at today is

125
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:40.930
about someone who gets reached in her ordinary life and she gets spoken to in her home and gets a

126
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:49.060
revelation of God in a way that was completely unexpected. Her expectation was that today was just

127
00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:56.600
gonna be another day. But there is no such thing with God, you see with God, there's always an

128
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:04.860
understanding that we must have about what it looks like for us to experience our relationship with

129
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:12.610
him. And it's not just about having a joyful expectation, but it's also about understanding how

130
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:21.920
favor works in our lives. And I think the greatest obstacle to that favor is us living in fear. And

131
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:30.220
I believe the story addresses that problem and that issue that I believe that all of us in one way

132
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:38.280
or another at one point or another in a specific time and place in our journey, are going to need to

133
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:44.410
overcome. And that's why if we understand the principles that God has in store for us in this

134
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:50.860
particular story, then we're going to be able to apply them in the season of our life in which we

135
00:33:50.860 --> 00:34:00.850
need it most. So that we experience God's favor and not be blocked by fear. And so today we're gonna

136
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:10.500
learn about how we can overcome fear with favor and in Luke chapter one in verse 26 we're gonna read

137
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:19.130
all the way to verse 38 this is the story in which we're in. And it was in the 6th month of

138
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:31.590
Elizabeth's pregnancy that God sent the Angel Gabriel to Nazareth who now we know and this place is

139
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:42.090
just a village in Galilee. But it's considered to be the place with pretty much the worst reputation.

140
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:54.870
And the angel came to a virgin that was named Mary and she was engaged to be married to a man named

141
00:34:54.870 --> 00:35:02.910
joseph and he was a descendant of King David. And you can see that they're setting the story up for

142
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:12.730
what is not just the miracle of the moment, but also of what needs to unfold in terms of the

143
00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:21.630
fulfillment of prophecies. And then in verse 28 says that Gabriel appeared to her and then said

144
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:34.940
greetings and then calls her favored woman and then declares the Lord is with you. And look at what

145
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:46.880
her response is. Her response is one of confusion and she's disturbed. Mary tried to think what the

146
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:56.560
angel could mean because she didn't see herself as someone who was favored and as someone whom the

147
00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:06.700
Lord could be with. Have you ever felt like someone else was favored that God was with someone else,

148
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:15.050
but not with you, that you weren't the favored one. That the blessing of God and his accompanying

149
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:24.900
presence wasn't with you. It was with others, but not you. And if you live your life like this, then

150
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:33.600
you're going to know a lot more fear in your life and not live with the favor that God has already

151
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:44.060
put on you instead as his son. And as his daughter, just like mary needed to be told that the favor

152
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:54.920
of God was on her. You need to hear this for yourself today. You need to stop with the negative

153
00:36:54.930 --> 00:37:06.170
thinking and you need to move out of the negative living and walk away from the fear that is

154
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:17.390
blocking you and turn instead to the favor that is already upon you. And there is no one who can do

155
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:31.650
that for you. But God and in the same way that the angel came and appeared and had to declare this

156
00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:41.400
over mary's life for the first time in her life, she's understood two things that she has never

157
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:49.830
believed in before. One, she was highly favored by God and to the Lord was always with her.

158
00:37:52.150 --> 00:38:02.350
I don't know how you go about living your life and walking around in this world, but I'm gonna that

159
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:10.540
that you do not walk around enough believing those two truths

160
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.820
that you are favored and that God is always with you.

161
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:29.040
And I believe that's a challenge to all of us to just change that about how we go about our life and

162
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:36.600
understand that whatever the circumstances are that God is calling us out of the old and is bringing

163
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:45.470
us into the new And in verse 30, he has to tell her because the first thing that happens to her is

164
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:52.660
that she's disturbed. But the second thing that happens to her is that fear sets in and I believe

165
00:38:52.660 --> 00:39:03.170
that there are amazing things that God is doing to disrupt us and is trying to lead us to a place of

166
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:13.920
favor. But instead of experiencing favor, we experience fear. And I've been there, I've been there

167
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:24.250
so many times where I wanted God to to work in my life and and and and instead I didn't realize how

168
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:32.450
I was blocking God from doing exactly that I wasn't living with the knowledge of his favor and I

169
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:40.000
wasn't living with the knowledge of his constant presence. I was allowing life to disturb me and to

170
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.770
paralyze me with fear instead of giving me the breakthrough that I needed to live out my life in

171
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:57.830
faith with the favor of God instead. And I know that this is a challenge that we face on the regular.

172
00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:05.750
It is something that is constantly affecting us in our everyday right now. We are living with

173
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:13.990
anxiety and worry and the stresses of this life right now, we can be so overcome with fear that we

174
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:20.890
stop believing that there is a way for God to get us out of it. Because the only way that we think

175
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:29.270
that things can change is by human intervention, we either have to get ourselves out of it or

176
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:36.860
someone has to come and rescue us from it. And I know that God can help us in both of those ways,

177
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:45.910
bringing people into our life and then just pushing us out of our comfort zone to take steps that we

178
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:53.830
normally would not take and exercise our faith in a manner that brings about the favor of God

179
00:40:53.840 --> 00:41:04.910
instead of the way that we can be overcome by fear. And so the angel comes and he says to mary,

180
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:12.990
don't be afraid. How many of you are afraid of something right here right now. Something that is

181
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:20.690
really scaring you the outcome of something that is uncertain steps that need to be taken, decisions

182
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:27.030
that need to be made, things that you're working on. You're not seeing the results another year

183
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:36.170
going by and things remaining in many ways unchanged. That feeling of emptiness, loneliness still

184
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:44.720
persisting. Even though you should be more grateful and just more joyful, but you just can't seem to

185
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:54.510
get there. If this is you, you need to understand that you are not living under the favor of God

186
00:41:54.510 --> 00:42:01.470
right now, not the way that he has already given it to you. See, it isn't a question of whether God

187
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:11.710
has given you his favor. It's a question of are you living like he has given you that favor? It

188
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:21.230
isn't a question of God saying I am with you, it's us believing that he is with us. The problem

189
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:28.160
isn't on God's side. It's on ours and how I have to train my mind every day, no matter how things

190
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.070
are going, no matter how they appear, no matter how I may feel, no matter how disturbed and how

191
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:42.780
fearful I may become that I will not allow myself to stay in this place because I know that we are

192
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:50.910
favored by God and this presence is with us. Can we say Amen, Hey, come on. This is this is what

193
00:42:50.910 --> 00:43:01.170
we've got to do. We've gotta break the pattern of our thinking if we are to see any change in the

194
00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:12.330
way that we are living. And so he says to her, I want you to know that you have found favor with God.

195
00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:23.360
And I love that because in verse 31, he then tells her what's gonna happen. He says, you're

196
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:33.160
going to conceive and give birth to a son. You're gonna name him, Jesus and he's gonna be great and

197
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:40.450
will be called the son of the most high and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor,

198
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:48.910
David. In other words, he's going to be king and he's going to reign over Israel forever and his

199
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:56.530
kingdom will never end. And then mary of course, asked the angel. But how can this happen? How can I

200
00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:02.930
have a child if I am a virgin? And then the angel replies, this is how it's going to happen, mary

201
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:09.800
the Holy Spirit is gonna come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. So the

202
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:21.900
baby that will be born will be holy cannot come from a human father. It must be an act of God and he

203
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:30.130
will be called the son of God. And what's more, you need to also know something amazing is happening

204
00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:40.750
in your own family Elizabeth, your relative has also become pregnant in her old age. And what God is

205
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:47.720
doing here is that he's telling her, I know this sounds impossible, but let me tell you about

206
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:55.780
something else impossible that I've already done something else that's happened six months ago, just

207
00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:06.680
so that it encourages you to overcome your fear so that you can experience this favor. Mhm. I'm

208
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:13.460
gonna tell you about someone that you know, who has also experienced the favor of God. And I want

209
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:21.200
you to understand that God will give us examples in our life of the favor of God in the lives of

210
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:29.100
people we know so that we will look at that and not feel bad about ourselves, not feel less, not

211
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:42.290
feel like we shouldn't look at ourselves as people who are undeserving, but acknowledge that if God

212
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:54.770
can do this in that life, then he can do it in mind. And if we can see how God brings the witness of

213
00:45:54.770 --> 00:46:05.580
others to remind us of the favor of God. And so the next time you hear someone just talk about how

214
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:12.960
God has blessed them, what that should do in your life does not make you better. Does not lead you

215
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.860
to a place of disappointment and resentment, A place where you're doubting God And and wondering

216
00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:31.690
where your favor is? But it is a reminder that God is also with you. He isn't just with them. Doing

217
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:40.770
something great in their life. But he's with you, about to do something great in yours. And you need

218
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:48.980
to look at that and say God in the same way that you blessed Elizabeth, you are about to bless mary

219
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:56.760
in the same way that you bless so and so you're about to bless me in the same way that you were with

220
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:04.920
them. You are with me in the same way that you gave them favor. You are giving me favor as well. And

221
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:11.380
when you declare these things over your life, you are declaring the truth and the promises of God.

222
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:19.860
This is not you denying your reality. This is not you denying the hardship. This is not you denying

223
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:26.530
the hardscape of your life and heart and the difficulties that you are in and that you're facing.

224
00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:33.600
This is not you denying that things are hard in this moment. But this is you understanding that even

225
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:44.100
in those hard places, even in those hardest of moments, God is still with you and this favor is

226
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:53.210
still upon you. Nothing has changed. And when we understand that we get through the hard stuff, we

227
00:47:53.210 --> 00:48:01.920
get through the hard moments, we praise God in those seasons, in which it's hard to do exactly that

228
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:09.560
because we don't see the good, we can't see what's great. Not about what we're going through, But

229
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:17.080
what about the favor that is always upon you? Can you give glory to God for that? Can you give God

230
00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:23.310
the glory for his presence? That never leaves you? Of course you can. And you must you see that's

231
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:29.800
what changes things in your mind and in your heart. And no matter how difficult the circumstances

232
00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:38.060
are in front of you, you say, I can do this, I can overcome this. I will be victorious in this. I

233
00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:45.700
will not be defeated here. I will not lose my life and I will not lose my legacy in these moments

234
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:54.120
because the Lord is with me and his favor is upon me. When we understand that. Then we understand

235
00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:06.200
that the word of God, verse 37 will never fail. It never fails. It never comes back empty. His

236
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:13.480
promises are always yes and amen to those who believe in them. Was that going to be you? Are you

237
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:20.790
going to believe in those promises? See mary responded, I am the Lord's servant, may, everything you

238
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:29.330
have said about me come true. And then the angel left her. There was this anticipation. A joyful

239
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:38.010
anticipation that she finally has everything that you have said, May that come true. The joyful

240
00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:46.770
expectation of God keeping his word towards us. The joyful expectation that his presence was with

241
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:55.720
her the joyful expectation that his favor was upon her. And I look at the story and I see so many

242
00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:03.390
things that can parallel our own life, in our own situation? The first thing is God's favor is not

243
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:18.530
where you expected it. You know, they came to the angel, came to Mary in Nazareth, it should have

244
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:30.950
been in Jerusalem. You know, john got his revelation where he got it in the temple. It made sense.

245
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:39.020
It made sense because he was a priest serving God and he was in the temple and then he was in

246
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:45.240
Jerusalem. Those are the two places that God people always expected God to speak to his people, you

247
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:57.670
understand? But in the story of Mary, he speaks to Mary in Nazareth of Galilee and not in a temple,

248
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:04.790
but in her home. And I want you to see that you may not see yourself as a, as a priest or a

249
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:14.010
priestess. You may not see yourself in a holy city in a holy place serving in a Holy Tabernacle, a

250
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:22.870
part of a holy temple where you would expect God to speak, maybe you just see yourself in Nazareth

251
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.870
in a place called Galilee

252
00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:40.400
in your home. But guess what? The Angel came there to speak to mary anyways, right where she was.

253
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:52.130
Mhm. She didn't have to become someone else, forgot to tell her he was already with her and his

254
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:59.130
favor was upon her, can we say amen to that? She didn't have to become someone other than who she

255
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:05.340
already was. You understand what's happening in the story, Do you understand how amazing that is

256
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:13.510
that you don't have to become someone else. That you can just be you the way you are right now. Your

257
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:21.420
broken self in a broken home, in a broken city, that is far from the presence of God. But the

258
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:27.560
presence of God comes and meets you right there anyways and tells you that my presence is always

259
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.670
with you and guess what? No matter how broken things are, no matter how broken they look, no matter

260
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:40.430
how broken you are, I guess what my favor is always with you. Just like my presence is always upon

261
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:50.290
you, wow, can you praise God for that? Hey, we're not, we're not just praising God for that in

262
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:59.750
Mary's life, we're praising that God for that in our life. Isn't that beautiful? And so it's not

263
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:15.210
where we expected, but it's also not who you expected. God chose someone that again, no one would

264
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:22.480
have chosen. You think it's a coincidence that that that Jesus chose his disciples from, from

265
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:31.820
Galilee that he himself was from Nazareth. You know, like john was, was born to Zachariah High

266
00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:40.580
Priest, you know, he received an incredible revelation of who he was, that he would be someone who

267
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:50.930
was great and powerful, that people when they heard john speak and they saw his presence, they went

268
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:57.660
to see him no matter where he was because they were drawn to his voice crying out in the wilderness.

269
00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:05.300
They knew the anointing of God was upon his life, like like no one before him.

270
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:16.310
And people believe that even as Jesus taught that even as he performed miracles, people went to

271
00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:26.440
Jesus thinking maybe you're john who's come back to life because they all believed that the prophecy

272
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:35.450
that had been given towards john wasn't pointing to Jesus, it was supposed to be john. But what God

273
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:45.810
does is he takes the low things. He takes the meek things and he takes the humble things and he

274
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:54.580
takes those things that are considered weak and he uses those things to tear down the strongholds of

275
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.550
this world.

276
00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:12.190
And when we are weak and we are meek. And when we recognize our inability to be powerful and

277
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:21.360
recognize that in us, it is hard for us to see greatness. It is in those moments that when we come

278
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:32.480
before God, God tells us, don't you understand that's exactly who I love to work with the most. And

279
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:42.580
when you are like this, I can now show my power in your weakness. I can show my strength and I can

280
00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:53.790
take you in the state that you're in and I can turn you into a symbol of my blessing and favor so

281
00:55:53.790 --> 00:56:06.540
that others can believe in me through you God wants to take you the way you are and reveal his power

282
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:15.640
and his presence through your life. He wants to do that in you. Where you work where you go to

283
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:23.090
school in the city in which you live in the people that you interact with in your everyday life in

284
00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:29.140
the moments that you think that you are not going to make any kind of great difference in those

285
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:34.470
moments when you're just going about your hobbies and your interests, when you're just doing the

286
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:41.950
things that you love, but you leave room for God in all of that and you allow God to reveal in your

287
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:50.000
life and through your life that he is always with you and that his favor is always upon you and you

288
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.720
walk about this world, understanding that every opportunity and every moment, no matter how mundane

289
00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:05.270
and no matter how repetitive, no matter how monotonous, no matter how it may even feel like it's a

290
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:12.610
moment in which we are living out with regret. God is saying even in those moments, I'm always with

291
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:22.600
you and my favor is upon you. And when you live like that, ordinary moments become extraordinary

292
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:29.010
opportunities for God to reveal how he is with you and how his favor is upon you.

293
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:42.370
And if we can do that more often than we have in this whole previous year put together, if we can

294
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:48.640
start to just do this a little bit, you know what's gonna happen, God is gonna show up in our lives

295
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:56.300
and he's going to encourage us, just the way he did with mary, so that she could move out of a place

296
00:57:56.310 --> 00:58:02.950
of fear and just being disturbed in her spirit to a place where she could lean on the spirit of God

297
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:10.430
and live with his favor instead. Are you ready to do that in your own life to start seeing new

298
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:19.110
things and experiencing them in a new way? Because this is what God is about to offer all of us if

299
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:29.760
we will take to heart the words that he has spoken in mary's life, but for our life, because

300
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:37.290
everything that we see in the scriptures isn't just for someone in the scriptures, it's how we are

301
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:47.050
to see and understand ourselves. I I look at the story and I see that God also says it's not how you

302
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:54.670
expected. You know, she, she was engaged to be married, she knew she was going to be a mom one day.

303
00:58:54.680 --> 00:59:00.710
This is not how she expected to be a mom, right? Like it's just not how and I think sometimes like

304
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.910
our expectations of what our life is supposed to be and how things are supposed to turn out just get

305
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:12.670
like destroyed to get to get upended. It's a good thing in the sense that God is the one who's in

306
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:18.160
control, but but but for us, like we don't see God in control, but we just see is just maybe bad

307
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:24.280
decisions. Maybe we just see just disastrous outcomes. Maybe we just see there's no way for us to

308
00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:30.660
come back from this. Maybe we just see the presence of God leaving us his favor no longer upon us.

309
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:36.820
Maybe we just see the Brokenness and we can't see the healing. We can't see the restoration. We

310
00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:42.320
can't see the new beginning. We can't see how God is about to do a new thing when we've messed up

311
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:48.740
everything before. That. Does that make sense? Sometimes we're just living in those moments where we

312
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:56.000
just can't get past it. We're just disturbed and we're afraid were filled with fear for the future.

313
00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:03.880
And God is saying, don't you understand, here's what is going to change everything. My Holy Spirit

314
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:13.670
is going to come upon you. My spirit is what changes everything you want to bring healing into your

315
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:21.470
life. It's not gonna come unless my spirit comes upon you and heals you and reaches the innermost

316
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:29.600
parts of your heart and your life, it's gonna have to be my spirit that comes upon you. It is my

317
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.270
spirit coming upon you. That is going to change your future and your outcome. That's going to take

318
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:43.280
away the fear. It's my Holy Spirit in you. That is going to reveal my presence with you always. My

319
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.570
Holy Spirit upon you is what is going to tell you in the moments when it's the hardest for you to

320
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:57.140
believe it, that my favor is upon you and it never leaves you, no matter what happens. You don't

321
01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:09.190
stop being a son and a daughter of your heavenly father. Nothing can separate you from that love. No

322
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:16.450
one can separate you from him. There is nothing that can do that.

323
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:33.150
God permanently has taken your life into his nail scarred hands. It says you will always be mine.

324
01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:46.680
And so the favor of God is always upon you. So let the Holy Spirit come into your life like never

325
01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:53.110
before. Can you do something right now? Maybe you've never asked the Holy Spirit to come into your

326
01:01:53.110 --> 01:02:01.010
life? Maybe you've never asked the Holy Spirit to come upon you and to fill you and to transform you

327
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:08.330
like never before. Can you do that right now say Holy Spirit come into my life. Holy Spirit fill me.

328
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:15.390
Holy Spirit just change my mind and my heart. Holy Spirit heal me where I'm broken, where I'm

329
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:23.350
hurting where I cannot reach, where medicine cannot touch, where where therapy cannot cannot break

330
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:32.470
through just yet. Lord, can you do what needs to be done in a way that I know that your Holy Spirit

331
01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:41.230
can only do it's a father as we turn our attention to you and as we ask you in this moment to to

332
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:49.640
reveal your spirit to each of us. Would you fill us like never before and remind us of your presence

333
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:58.730
And would you reveal your favor so that we can always be reminded no matter what the moment is that

334
01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:09.390
we are highly favored of the Lord and we pray this in Jesus' name, amen. Hey man, you guys good, thank

335
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:10.490
you so much.

336
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:19.120
Hey, we're just gonna wrap this up right now and I'm going to ask for the band to come back and

337
01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.830
there's a song that I would love for us to sing together and it's called Reckless Love, you guys

338
01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:31.500
familiar with it, it's just a beautiful song to remind us of who he is and his heart for us. Would

339
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:37.820
you stand and as we would sing this song as we end this gathering, then Christine is gonna come back

340
01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:42.240
up and just give us some instructions about you know the great meal that we're about to have you

341
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:49.430
guys excited for the Christmas meal, that amazing, great opportunity for us to just hang out and

342
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:55.230
experience community again. And so let's sing this song together. It's reckless love and then I'll

343
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.950
see you guys afterwards as well, God bless you.

344
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:22.340
This isn't a Christmas song, but it's, I think it's why we have Christmas in the first place and

345
01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:32.190
that's because of God's relentless, reckless, endless pursuit of us. So wherever you are, if you're

346
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:38.180
broken, if you're weak, if you're feeling disqualified counted out, I know Christmas is a hard time

347
01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.710
for those going through a hard time,

348
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:48.560
God is with you, God is for you and so just just soak in his presence, I feel like this song is for

349
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:53.770
for some of us tonight today and we're gonna have some awesome food. We're gonna have some

350
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.750
fellowship after. But let's press into Jesus. Let's drive this home.

363
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:27.670
Incredible song, really touched my heart. I can feel his presence so strong, but his presence is my

364
01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:32.980
favorite place. So it's the best place to be. Um, yeah, so I just really believe we're so thankful

365
01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:38.020
that you came and I really believe that this word and the worship and everything that has happened

366
01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:43.080
today has blessed you that God is really moving in your heart maybe in ways that you don't even know

367
01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:47.690
right now and throughout the week, this word is gonna come up in the moments that you need it that

368
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:54.390
pastors oh spoke. And also just recognizing and remembering his presence is with you, it goes before

369
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:59.160
you, it's in for it's behind you and it's inside of you. So just remember that no matter what

370
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:06.180
happens in your life, whether it's unexpected or confusing or frustrating whatever it is God can be

371
01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:12.360
trusted. You can trust his goodness and he loves you. Um, and we just want to thank you again for

372
01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:17.890
your generosity. So just know that it doesn't go unnoticed. And a lot of times when you give to the

373
01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:23.600
church, you don't see the fruit of it right in front of you. So just know that things are happening,

374
01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.680
Lives are changing, that you may not even see the seed that you're sowing are growing and they're

375
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:33.520
gonna keep growing, lives are changing in the church, in the city and also just around the world,

376
01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.140
around the nation. So things that things are happening, God is moving and we just want to thank you

377
01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:43.630
for that. We're also here for you. You know, if you need anything, we love you and we care about you

378

379
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.500
