also wanna talk about the team night which is coming up on this Wednesday the 29th at 7 29. So if

70
00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:08.270
There's gonna be a bit of worship food and a little short message from Pastor Lorenzo. And also if

71
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:13.270
you don't want to serve any team or anything, but you still want to help out the community. There's

72
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:22.199
always four ways to give and uh they should be on the screen. There we go. And then following a

73
00:26:22.209 --> 00:26:31.209
after next, uh, for the Easter Sunday service there is our Good Friday, which starts at 7 30 our

74
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:36.579
Easter Sunday starts at 10 30 like our normal, normal times. All the information is on the board.

75
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.869
And so, yeah, that's pretty much all the announcements. I'd like to invite Pastor Lorenzo out for

76
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.369
his, uh, his message and, uh, we'll see you guys later

77
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.910
to call up. Uh Chris and Esther. Esther is here too. Chris, is it just you? Is it both of you? Yeah.

78
00:27:32.979 --> 00:27:42.390
Yeah, that's OK. You know what um uh can we pray for you guys at the end? OK, cool. Um And uh we'll

79
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:51.119
do that right after she's dropping off. Uh Eliah kids, right? Gotcha. How's everyone doing? The guys

80
00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.589
are good.

81
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:59.479
So glad that you could be here today and just be a part of this community of faith. And it's, it's

82
00:27:59.489 --> 00:28:05.959
an ongoing thing to be able to be here each and every week and it requires so many people to make

83
00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:10.310
that happen. And that's why we have a team night. It's a night where we can show appreciation, but

84
00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:16.380
we can also call others into service and into community right here at and one of the best ways to

85
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:21.900
feel a part of something is and to belong is, is to also serve and it not only helps us in our own

86
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:26.994
spiritual journey, but it creates, it's another level of community. So we experience something like

87
00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:33.425
this. But then there's a way that we can all go deeper and you can ask anyone who's ever served in a

88
00:28:33.435 --> 00:28:39.540
community of faith like this before or those that are serving right now, they'll tell you that uh

89
00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:48.479
church changes so much once you start to give back and it becomes so much more meaningful in that

90
00:28:48.489 --> 00:28:54.579
act of service and of kindness to others. And one of the things that we always communicate is that

91
00:28:54.589 --> 00:28:59.579
this is a place where everybody can belong before they believe. And what we have is a team of people

92
00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:05.640
who set the table. And it's just kind of like being invited over to somebody's house. And, and so

93
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.410
there are people who work behind the scenes to make sure that when you come, the table is set, you

94
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.859
don't have to bring anything, you don't have to do anything. You just get to enjoy that. But if

95
00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:21.869
you're ready to take that next step in your journey so that you can set the table for somebody else,

96
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:27.560
then that's what team Night is about as well. And so I want to invite you into that and it's going

97
00:29:27.569 --> 00:29:34.130
to be a great opportunity for us to just hear some things about the future, but also about the

98
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:39.689
things that we're kind of living and experiencing right now. Well, I don't know if today is going to

99
00:29:39.699 --> 00:29:44.290
be the last message in this series. So I'm not going to call it that we've been in this series

100
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.729
called, becoming the one for a while. And then we're going to take a break because next Sunday is

101
00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:55.479
going to be Palm Sunday. Isn't it crazy that Easter is already here? It's like it's come really

102
00:29:55.489 --> 00:29:59.930
quick this year. And so next Sunday is going to be Palm Sunday and then the one after that, of

103
00:29:59.939 --> 00:30:03.839
course, it is Easter Sunday. And in between, we have Good Friday. I want to invite you to guys to

104
00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:10.109
those things as well. But this message today could be the last one, I'm not sure, but it could be

105
00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:16.930
also just a continuation that might happen right after Easter. But today, we're going to look at a

106
00:30:16.939 --> 00:30:28.599
key verse And it's found in Hosea and it's in Chapter two and it's verse 19 and 20 and it says I'm

107
00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:39.880
gonna betroth you to me forever and I'm gonna betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice. And

108
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:46.640
this version says I'm going to make you my wife forever and I'm going to show you righteousness and

109
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:54.969
justice, unfailing love and compassion. And when it talks about this steadfast love, it talks about

110
00:30:54.979 --> 00:31:01.310
this level of faithfulness. And this is really a key verse in this book of Hosea, as we're talking

111
00:31:01.319 --> 00:31:08.930
about relationships. And I think during the course of their marriage, they had a lot of challenges,

112
00:31:08.939 --> 00:31:13.800
a lot of difficulties and, and I think that if you've ever been in a relationship, you know, how

113
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:19.959
challenging it can be. Sometimes you feel like you have found the right person for you. But there

114
00:31:19.969 --> 00:31:27.515
seems to always be something that is interfering with your relationship. It could be external, it

115
00:31:27.525 --> 00:31:32.084
could be internal, it could be a different set of values. It could be a misunderstanding through

116
00:31:32.094 --> 00:31:38.425
communication. And often we are faced with conflicts and the biggest challenge that most couples

117
00:31:38.435 --> 00:31:43.880
have is that they don't know how to overcome those conflicts. That's the reality is that most of us

118
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:52.390
have to learn how to be in relationship with someone else. And in that sometimes it feels super easy

119
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:59.280
and sometimes it feels incredibly hard and almost impossible. And as a result, anyone that is in a

120
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:05.599
relationship will tell you that for the most part, the thing that still is tough for them is the

121
00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:12.030
communication and maybe even the conflict resolution aspect of the relationship. And so this is not

122
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:19.689
any different for Hosea and Gomer in this story because they have a lot of problems and the problems

123
00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:26.630
are from the beginning and right from the start, there are challenges that they're dealing with and

124
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.979
that they're facing that are making it incredibly difficult for them to have any kind of hope. Well,

125
00:32:32.989 --> 00:32:39.770
today we're going to talk about the gateway of hope and how when we face these conflicts and when we

126
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:47.089
face relationship, communication issues that there are certain habits that God gives us, that we can

127
00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:53.329
implement so that we can have a healthy relationship, whether we are in one or we will be in one.

128
00:32:53.339 --> 00:33:00.339
These are principles that He gives us so that we can escape the hardships that a lot of couples and

129
00:33:00.349 --> 00:33:06.589
a lot of relationships deal with on an ongoing basis. Now, the things about the thing about Hosea

130
00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:12.390
and Gomer is that they ended up having three kids and those three Children made it incredibly

131
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.050
difficult for them to also have peace in their relationship from everything that we can see. The

132
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:30.750
first child that Hosea and Gomer have, that is their child together. And that child has a name that

133
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:40.420
goes by Jezreel and that meaning means God sows. The second child that they have isn't Hosea and,

134
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:48.770
and Gomer runs out on Hosea and has a sexual relationship and then has sexual relationships at a

135
00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:59.359
temple that has this as a ritual to Canaanite gods. One of them being bail and, and Gomer is at this

136
00:33:59.369 --> 00:34:06.359
temple and is having many sexual partners. She gets pregnant and God instructs Hosea to still take

137
00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:14.580
her back. And then when he takes them back, she's pregnant, she has this child. This child now is

138
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:23.879
called not pity or basically without mercy. And, and the idea there is that there is this

139
00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:29.939
relationship between Hosea and Gomer that is getting increasingly worse, it's not getting better,

140
00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:34.699
it's getting worse. And God is looking at this and he's saying, this is what my relationship looks

141
00:34:34.709 --> 00:34:41.969
like with Israel. This is what it often looks like with my people. And so it starts off with

142
00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:51.989
promises and a covenant and with incredible expectations of blessing. But then along the way, we can

143
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.469
become unfaithful and in our unfaithfulness experience, what would be the consequences of that

144
00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:04.939
unfaithfulness? And God still is saying, but I'm willing to take you back. And, and so therefore, he

145
00:35:04.949 --> 00:35:10.590
encourages Hosea to do the same thing. And I think this is important because sometimes when there's

146
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:17.800
infidelity in a relationship, when someone has cheated and there's been a break up there of trust

147
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:23.100
and, and, and when there has been this violation, we sometimes think that there's no way of coming

148
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:28.810
back from that. But what the scriptures show us is that there is, there always is, but there has to

149
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.800
be a willingness on both parties, obviously to be able to take those steps forward. But it may feel

150
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:40.219
like there is no way forward. But what the story of Jose and Gomer teach us is that there definitely

151
00:35:40.229 --> 00:35:45.120
is. If there's hope for this couple, then there's hope for any couple. And then there's a way for us

152
00:35:45.129 --> 00:35:52.520
to believe that God can redeem restore and reestablish a covenant that was there and present at the

153
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:58.820
beginning, but maybe not there as time went on in that relationship, God can still do something

154
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:04.840
miraculous and bring back that couple to a place where they can experience a blessing again. And so

155
00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:10.649
then the third child that they have again is in Hosea. Gora goes out and does the same things and,

156
00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:15.879
and then Hosea goes out and gets her and brings her back. And then this time, it's gotten to the

157
00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:22.090
point where Jose is told to name this child, not my people.

158
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.419
And so you see that there's this complete degradation in terms of the relationship and, and each

159
00:36:29.429 --> 00:36:37.330
child symbolically represents the relationship of the state of God's relationship with his people.

160
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:43.709
But also a reflection of the relationship between Jose and Gomer and, and as a result of this, there

161
00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:50.969
are certain things that are said, certain things that are done in this passage to kind of give us an

162
00:36:50.979 --> 00:36:58.800
idea of what can happen in this type of situation. And so obviously, you can imagine that home

163
00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:07.620
Hosea's anger towards Gomer is just like next level, the level of betrayal that he feels and

164
00:37:07.629 --> 00:37:13.080
everything else. And, and God is trying to express those sentiments when he's actually talking to

165
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:20.659
his people and listen to what these verses uh say. So God and I want you to imagine God and Hosea as

166
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:28.750
slashed the husband and, and uh go the wife in this. And I want you to hear what the verses are

167
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:35.030
actually highlighting. And so so God, the husband is going to strip her naked, make her like a

168
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.379
wilderness and he's going to do this in front of her lovers. Um, he's gonna kill her with thirst.

169
00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:46.360
He's gonna isolate her. He's going to refuse to provide for her well being and he's gonna humiliate

170
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:55.250
her before her lovers. That's pretty harsh, isn't it? Like, it's like really extreme and, and, and I

171
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.699
want you to understand that in the story in which we're in, what God is doing is that he's, he's

172
00:37:59.709 --> 00:38:06.530
trying to, he's trying to express the pain that he himself is feeling, which is interesting because

173
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:13.449
if I'm God, I wouldn't allow myself to feel that pain. I wouldn't, I wouldn't let myself go and

174
00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:19.280
experience that level of betrayal. And what we're hearing is that is that when God looks at us and

175
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:24.949
looks at our unfaithfulness that this is what he can describe and, and then, then we get it when

176
00:38:24.959 --> 00:38:31.469
Hosea thinks like this because we've seen what uh what can happen in some relationships where there

177
00:38:31.479 --> 00:38:42.649
is violence in that relationship where there is uh very much actions that can uh articulate

178
00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:49.860
something that is really wrong towards another person. And, and it could be, you know, a woman

179
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:55.040
towards a man just like it can be a man towards a woman. But what we see here is that sometimes, and

180
00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:02.179
we know this to be true, there can be violence and abuse in the household and, and everything that

181
00:39:02.189 --> 00:39:08.919
we just read, there is a description of that violence it's a description of that abuse. It's, it's

182
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:16.439
about taking it to an extent and to a length and to a place that it should never have gone to. But

183
00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:23.360
this is what God is doing. He's not hiding the emotions of what can happen, the reality of where it

184
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:29.649
can take you the dark places in your mind and in your heart that you can be pushed to the things

185
00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:36.560
that you could do in a situation like that. And so the things that are being described are very dark,

186
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:42.139
they're evil, they're wrong. It's not to say those things are right, but it's to show how wrong they

187
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:47.909
are. And then what happens is that even though these are the emotions, these are the thoughts, these

188
00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:53.560
are the things that we can maybe express to a friend and to a family member or even to the person

189
00:39:53.570 --> 00:40:00.050
themselves who has betrayed us that God then says, but wait a second, there's another way to

190
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:06.340
approach this. There's another way to see this and to understand this and this is what I want you to

191
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:14.360
do. I want you to see this and understand this in a different way. And so what happens is that in

192
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:22.429
the third chapter, I love how God's actions against uh Gomer and Hosea's actions against Gomer are

193
00:40:22.439 --> 00:40:30.239
completely different. In fact, in the story, in which we're in, it becomes something else. He says,

194
00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:37.149
I've now commanded you to love your adulterous wife.

195
00:40:39.389 --> 00:40:50.169
I want you to do everything that you can to have her back in your home, restored to a place and to

196
00:40:50.179 --> 00:41:00.550
an experience of where she is provided for. I want you to do all that is required that you can re

197
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:14.939
establish a covenant relationship in your household. And that is the place where I believe that God

198
00:41:14.949 --> 00:41:25.610
wants us to experience his heart And not the anger that is being expressed in Chapter two. And so in

199
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:36.199
Chapter three, Hosea goes and he gets all of the resources that he has and he brings them back, two.

200
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:46.560
Hosea brings them back to Gomer, puts it before her and the person who is now captured her has

201
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:55.389
authority over her somehow has been indebted to and then he releases her completely from that debt

202
00:41:55.399 --> 00:42:01.879
and he restores her back into his household. Now, one of the things I want to share with you today,

203
00:42:01.889 --> 00:42:07.889
and I think it's important for us to kind of set the stage for what we're talking about. And so the

204
00:42:07.899 --> 00:42:13.100
introduction that we've just kind of gone through, just kind of highlights the importance of how we

205
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:19.340
can get to a place where we don't have any hope. And so in Hosea chapter two verses six and seven,

206
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:23.969
because if I just show you these verses without giving you any kind of context, you're going to be

207
00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:32.239
maybe a little lost. So in Hosea chapter two verse six and seven, it says this is what God does. For

208
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:39.040
this reason, I will fence her in with thorn bushes. I'm going to block her path with a wall to make

209
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:44.560
her lose her way. And then in verse seven, it says that when she runs after her lovers, she won't be

210
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:50.469
able to catch them and she will search for them but not find them. Now, this passage is obviously

211
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:57.040
talking about Hosea and go. And so it's, it's, it's it's describing their relationship. So the the

212
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:04.540
him and the her in this is is interchangeable for us, right? It's, it's not speaking only to the

213
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.739
women in the room. It's, it's speaking to all of us and the principles that are there are for all of

214
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:14.260
us. And we're learning from the story, we're learning from the relationship, the couple that that is

215
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:20.669
in the story, we're learning from them. And so what God says He promises to do in this situation is

216
00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:27.270
that he promises to set the kind of boundaries around that person that are thorn bushes, basically a

217
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:34.560
wall as well. So that person has nowhere to go. In other words, that whatever they do outside of the

218
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:40.310
faithfulness that is required in a marriage relationship, that they are not going to find blessing.

219
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:50.560
And I want you to see how that, how God is saying I am going to interfere in this. I'm going to do

220
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:56.750
everything that I can to show you and to demonstrate to you that when you behave this way that you

221
00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:03.639
are outside of the parameters of my blessing and of my grace and of my mercy and of all the things

222
00:44:03.649 --> 00:44:08.320
that I have for you, you're not going to be able to experience those things because what you're

223
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:14.979
going to keep running into are thorn bushes and walls, things that are going to keep you away from

224
00:44:14.989 --> 00:44:21.409
the blessing that you should and anticipate to have. So you leave this person for that person, you

225
00:44:21.419 --> 00:44:26.229
do it the wrong way. Here's what's going to happen. This is what's going to be the result. This is

226
00:44:26.239 --> 00:44:31.689
what it's going to look like. This is how you're going to be living your life for the foreseeable

227
00:44:31.699 --> 00:44:39.320
future because you didn't do it in a manner that brought honor to me or to the person you were with

228
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:46.030
or to others in whose life you have interfered with as well. So God is saying, I want you to be

229
00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:54.780
aware of this because then in Hosea three verses one and two, look at what happens here. He says, go

230
00:44:54.790 --> 00:45:02.949
and love your wife again that even though she commits adultery with another lover in verse two, this

231
00:45:02.959 --> 00:45:07.459
will illustrate that the Lord still loves Israel, even though the people have turned to other gods

232
00:45:07.469 --> 00:45:14.020
and love to worship them. And when God says, what I want you to always do is see if there is a path

233
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:21.120
of forgiveness here, a path of reconciliation. A path of restoration. And so in this story, even

234
00:45:21.129 --> 00:45:27.979
though these things have happened, that there may be a way back from those things. And, and God says,

235
00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:35.159
I want you to work at trying to find a way back. I want you to do everything that you can to see if

236
00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:44.239
there can be a way back. And what's amazing in this story is that God says, through Hosea that he's

237
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.840
going to do certain things. And, and one of the things that he does is that after he accumulates all

238
00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:56.449
the wealth that he possibly has and pays off his wife's debt and brings her back home and re

239
00:45:56.459 --> 00:46:03.429
establishes a covenant with her. He then says to her, we are not going to have sexual relations,

240
00:46:03.439 --> 00:46:07.830
which you would understand, you would look at that and you would say, well, that makes sense. He's

241
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:14.129
been unfaithful. Why would he even have that desire to do such a thing? But what he's doing is

242
00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:20.949
something I think far more important than just resisting his sexual drive and impulses and having

243
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:26.590
relations with someone who has been unfaithful with him. What we see is that the intention here is

244
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:32.199
far different. And it's something that's actually described by the Apostle Paul. And Paul does this

245
00:46:32.209 --> 00:46:38.209
in First Corinthians chapter seven verse five is that he says this, he says, do not detri deprive

246
00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:45.120
each other of sexual relations unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited

247
00:46:45.129 --> 00:46:51.229
time, so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. And so what Paul is saying here is that

248
00:46:51.239 --> 00:46:57.020
sometimes things get broken in your relationship to the point where you don't feel any type of

249
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:04.620
connection or any desire for sexual intimacy. And as a result that you may start to withdraw from

250
00:47:04.629 --> 00:47:10.070
your partner. And one of the first areas that can suffer is the sexual intimacy part. And as a

251
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:17.000
result, God is saying, well, why don't you just intentionally talk about this? Discuss it? Talk

252
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:22.959
about why there isn't this connection? Talk about why there isn't this level of intimacy. Talk about

253
00:47:22.969 --> 00:47:29.639
where maybe you are trying to find this intimacy. Talk about maybe where you are being tempted to

254
00:47:29.649 --> 00:47:36.929
search and to act upon this level of intimacy. Talk about the things that maybe you have turned to

255
00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:43.590
to satisfy yourself, maybe in a self pleasuring way so that you can just get past the fact that you

256
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:50.270
no longer have any kind of sexual intimacy in your relationship. And what what Paul is saying is

257
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:58.300
what God does in the case of Hosea and Gomer is that he says, I want you to actually take time apart

258
00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:09.909
to pray, get stronger so that your sexual life can be just as active than, and, and, and hold him

259
00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:15.260
and not in a way in which uh goer you were trying to satisfy yourself and, and the things that you

260
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:20.959
did when you escaped your household and escaped your husband and tried to find out some somewhere

261
00:48:20.969 --> 00:48:28.899
else. And so in Hosea chapter two, verse 14 and 15, let's take a look at those verses and it says,

262
00:48:28.909 --> 00:48:38.239
but then I'm going to do this, I'm gonna win her back and I'm going to lead her into the desert and

263
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:47.739
I'm going to speak tenderly to her there. And I want to focus on the fact that he is honest about

264
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:56.790
where the relationship is at. He's saying I'm gonna lead her into the desert and he knows that this

265
00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:02.530
is like the reality of the landscape. This is what the relationship is actually like. It's, it's not,

266
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:14.050
it's not in any way, a lush oasis where they're going to find everything to be amazing. It is not a

267
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:22.169
garden of Eden, it is a desert experience, but he then says, I'm going to win her back. I'm gonna

268
00:49:22.179 --> 00:49:28.810
speak tenderly to her and then look at this. Yeah, you can go uh thank you. I will return her

269
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:38.340
vineyards to her. And this means that there is a work that Hosea that God is promising to do. He's

270
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:48.300
saying that I'm going to bring back a place of flourishing of, of provision, a place that is going

271
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:57.659
to bring blessing and I'm going to transform this valley of trouble and there it is into a gateway

272
00:49:57.669 --> 00:50:04.000
of hope. And so when we turn our attention to God, this is what he says. I will take your desert and

273
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:11.330
I will transform it into a place where there are vineyards. This valley of trouble is now gonna

274
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:16.679
become a gateway of hope. And so when we're in a relationship and we're hitting a rough spot when

275
00:50:16.689 --> 00:50:22.729
we're in difficulty, even if we haven't cheated yet, even if it's just a thought and maybe it's just

276
00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:30.070
a temptation. And I assure you that, that, that Satan is just at work and just trying to destroy

277
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:37.270
your life and your relationship uh than, than he is. Everyone else is as well. And so we have to

278
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.590
just be aware of this, that these tactics are out there, these schemes are out there, that these

279
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:48.729
things are always a temptation to us. It's just the reality of what we deal with on a daily basis.

280
00:50:48.739 --> 00:50:55.290
And so we can't assume that these things aren't going to happen to us. Um because of the age or the

281
00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:03.320
position that we're in because of the circumstances. Um You know, none of those things are ever ever

282
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:11.469
hindrances. But what God can do is that He promises I can turn things around. And so I want us to

283
00:51:11.479 --> 00:51:19.389
believe in that right now and then understand that there are certain characteristics that come about

284
00:51:19.399 --> 00:51:27.179
in this relationship. If I'm going to lead someone into a desert experience and then speak tenderly

285
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:34.659
to them, and I'm gonna wait for God to turn this desert into vineyards and a valley of trouble into

286
00:51:34.669 --> 00:51:39.770
a gateway of hope and there's certain things that I'm gonna have to do and I wanna share what those

287
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:46.010
things are and, and, and this is something that is not just found in scriptures, but most therapists

288
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:52.699
will uh will talk about how when they, when they look at happy couples, when they look at couples

289
00:51:52.709 --> 00:52:01.709
that are healthy, that these are the things that they always do. And here's the first one, Number

290
00:52:01.719 --> 00:52:10.379
one, they always have the difficult conversations. A lot of us avoid them. And the reason for that

291
00:52:10.389 --> 00:52:20.129
is because we would prefer an artificial piece than a real one, we would be content with living the

292
00:52:20.139 --> 00:52:28.560
lie then facing the truth. You see, when we deal with the difficult issues in our relationships,

293
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:34.750
when we choose to have the difficult conversations, what God does that he puts us in a position

294
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.229
where he disarms the enemy and he disarms us.

295
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:48.520
He makes it impossible for other people to use what we're hiding and he makes it impossible for what

296
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:57.020
we are hiding to be weaponized by the devil himself. And so if we bring out into the open, what is

297
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:02.729
really going on, if we have the difficult conversations, then God is going to be able to do

298
00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:10.020
something with that. And Satan will not be able to do something with that. It'll be out in the open

299
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:15.620
between you and therefore not hidden, not a secret. It's not just something that's happening in your

300
00:53:15.629 --> 00:53:22.939
mind and every day you're dwelling on this and maybe being tempted by it, maybe you're not doing

301
00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:30.149
this every day outside of the relationship where you're going to a place that leads you into thorn

302
00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:36.979
bushes and walls, but rather into a place where you're going to experience vineyards and gateways of

303
00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:42.919
hope. And so the verse that I want to share with you is Ephesians chapter four verses 2 and three

304
00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:51.110
and it says, always be humble and gentle, be patient with each other, making allowances for each

305
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:59.020
other's faults because of your love. And then verse three, make every effort to keep yourselves

306
00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:07.060
united in the spirit, binding yourselves together with peace. Can we say amen to that? And you see

307
00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:14.610
that in this passage, it says that we are making every effort and we're talking to the person openly

308
00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:19.979
about what it is that we are going through what we're experiencing, what we're feeling and that

309
00:54:19.989 --> 00:54:25.000
person is doing the same, that person is listening, maybe they don't have the same shared feelings.

310
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:29.639
Sometimes the struggles are not shared and often in relationships. Sometimes it's like that it's

311
00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:34.729
like one person is having the struggle, the other person isn't. But if there's an environment where

312
00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:41.000
you can have difficult conversations, well, then it can lead you out of that place where that person

313
00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:48.830
isn't stuck in that mindset believing that there's no way out of this. And so what this scripture

314
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:55.149
reminds us is that there's a way to approach this. There's a way to do this that brings the health

315
00:54:55.159 --> 00:55:01.649
back into a healthy relationship. The second thing that we're taught in the scriptures is that we

316
00:55:01.659 --> 00:55:10.739
are not supposed to keep score, that we are not supposed to keep score. I think many of us are

317
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:16.209
blessed with a bad memory and others are blessed with an incredibly good memory. And sometimes

318
00:55:16.219 --> 00:55:25.030
because we have such a good memory, we can like basically reenact and, and just reverb the

319
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:32.520
conversation, you know, word per word in how it occurred and, and and dwell on the words that were

320
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:37.800
spoken and how they were articulated and the emotions that were behind that. And then the other

321
00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:43.270
person is kind of like oblivious to that and just kind of moves on emotionally and doesn't feel the

322
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.389
same connection to what the other person has lived. And those words don't have the same level of

323
00:55:48.399 --> 00:55:54.979
meaning to one person as they do to another. And therefore you start keeping score, you keep, you

324
00:55:54.989 --> 00:56:01.929
keep score because you realize that that person is, is not paying attention. And so you want them to

325
00:56:01.939 --> 00:56:08.159
pay attention. So sometimes you become a scorekeeper because you want the other person to not forget

326
00:56:08.169 --> 00:56:14.949
how they hurt you to not forget how they're hurting you. And so you don't let it go because if you

327
00:56:14.959 --> 00:56:20.459
let it go, it's like that person is never going to learn to stop being that way. So you feel like

328
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:28.169
you've really got to keep a record of this. And so you start keeping notes on your phone, you start

329
00:56:28.179 --> 00:56:30.389
documenting this with video.

330
00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:39.040
Y y you, you, you're paying for transcription of your conversation like you, even if it's 25 cents a

331
00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:46.729
word, you don't care because, because you need to make sure that these things are not forgotten,

332
00:56:46.739 --> 00:56:53.530
right? And sometimes that's what, what, what occurs. And so God says, hold on a second. If you want

333
00:56:53.540 --> 00:57:00.530
to be happy, if you want to find the gateway of hope in your relationship, if you want to resolve

334
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:08.780
conflict, then this is what I'm gonna ask you to do. And he tells us this in first Corinthians in

335
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:22.000
chapter 13 And in verse four and 5, he's saying love does what, it's, it's always patient, it's kind

336
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:28.239
and look at the end of it, it keeps no record of being wronged,

337
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:37.550
it keeps no record. And so there's, there's this idea that we have to get into this place where we

338
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.780
have to erase the record of wrong

339
00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:49.530
and say, Lord, the way that you erase my record of wrong, I'm going to have to do the same thing

340
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:55.090
because if there's going to be any hope for my marriage, for my relationship, there's going to be

341
00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:01.590
any hope for me to have a healthy relationship both now or in the future. I've got a change in this

342
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:07.459
area. I've got to remember that the love that I need is not gonna come from me, it's going to come

343
00:58:07.469 --> 00:58:14.290
from you and it is that love that is going to eliminate any record of wrong.

344
00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:23.899
And so let's take a look at number three, don't hold grudges. And interestingly enough, it sounds

345
00:58:23.909 --> 00:58:32.679
like it could be the same thing, but it's not, it's actually different because sometimes we hold a

346
00:58:32.689 --> 00:58:40.989
record of wrongs so that we can hold another person captive and keep them imprisoned to us, indebted

347
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.879
to us in servitude to us for what they did. But the emotion of a grudge is, is something else.

348
00:58:48.889 --> 00:58:55.270
Sometimes like you can actually keep a record of wrong and, and, and not hold a grudge. But there's

349
00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:03.879
a way that we can emotionally sometimes find ourselves not just penalizing The other person, but

350
00:59:03.889 --> 00:59:09.479
without realizing it, we are penalizing also ourselves. And in Colossians chapter three and in verse

351
00:59:09.489 --> 00:59:18.129
13, look at what it says, make allowance for each other's faults and forgive anyone who offends you.

352
00:59:18.139 --> 00:59:26.969
Remember the Lord forgave you. So you must forgive others, make allowances for other people's faults.

353
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:31.889
Now, the thing about relationships and this is where it gets tricky is that we have made those

354
00:59:31.899 --> 00:59:36.919
allowances because when we're in a relationship, when we're dating, we have seen what they are, we

355
00:59:36.929 --> 00:59:42.100
have maybe taken the next step and we've decided to, in some cases, some people move in before they

356
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:47.260
get married. And so they're taking different steps and I've seen people who go on vacation together

357
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:52.739
or they take a weekend away and then they decide to move in together and sometimes it's all mixed up

358
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:58.260
these days. You don't even know like what a person is doing and, and, and, and why it's just like,

359
00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:03.969
it just seems like they're just making the rules as they go along and, and in these days it's hard

360
01:00:03.979 --> 01:00:09.909
for a person to just, you know, also give up on another person and sometimes we give up on them

361
01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:15.580
really, really quickly because there's enough there for us to know this is not going to work and

362
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:21.530
then sometimes there's enough there for us to think well, that it can work. And as a result, what we

363
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:28.820
see in this passage is that we have to make allowances no matter what for, for people's faults and

364
01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:35.350
we have to be able to let go and to forgive and, and, and not to hold that against another person.

365
01:00:35.649 --> 01:00:43.149
And that's where I think some of us can struggle more than others. And we sometimes walk away from

366
01:00:43.159 --> 01:00:49.629
people even when we're dating, even when there's nothing wrong with this person because we're not

367
01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:54.939
allowing love to bloom. We're not allowing it to even get to a place where it can flourish because

368
01:00:55.149 --> 01:01:06.110
we just have trouble forgiving and letting things go. And so it never gets there. It never happens

369
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.709
because we've already been hurt. We've been offended. We've been disrespected. We've somehow already

370
01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:19.810
drawn the line and we've said that's it. It's over. And then we're surprised when, when couples call

371
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:27.850
it quits because they've made those vows, they've been together and then they've taken the journey

372
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:33.449
and they've overcome those things, what seemingly look like, things that they should have given up

373
01:01:33.639 --> 01:01:41.310
over and then they decide to give up like later on in their relationship after years of being

374
01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:48.989
together. And you kind of wonder, ok, what happened between seeing these things when you were dating,

375
01:01:50.179 --> 01:01:58.129
when you were on vacation together, living together, engaged? What happened that, that all of those

376
01:01:58.139 --> 01:02:05.689
things now they're not any different than the things that you got married two, but now you're giving

377
01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:14.639
up and, and I think it always comes down to these principles. It comes down to, hey, are you having

378
01:02:14.649 --> 01:02:24.229
the difficult conversations? Hey, are you keeping score? And are you holding grudges? And I feel

379
01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:31.000
that at some point if we don't do the right things in our relationship to have a healthy

380
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:37.320
relationship, it's, we're gonna have a break up, We're going to cheat on somebody, they're going to

381
01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:42.760
cheat on us. There's, there's something that's going to happen along the way that's going to cause

382
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:47.760
the rupture. And so God is saying, I'm going to show you what those things are that can safeguard

383
01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:53.800
your relationship so that you can always have that gateway of hope. Instead, here's number four.

384
01:02:56.570 --> 01:03:02.399
healthy couples and couples who experience a gateway of hope, don't call each other names.

385
01:03:04.669 --> 01:03:14.719
Um I cannot even say the word stupid to my wife and she'll knock me in the teeth. I, I can't,

386
01:03:15.129 --> 01:03:19.540
sometimes this happened like I, not that she's knocked me in my teeth but I, she has threatened that.

387
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:20.250
But uh

388
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:26.629
but I have said the word stupid. I said that's so stupid. That is such a stupid thing that you did.

389
01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:34.020
I said that and I, I, I, I, because I never talk like that, say things like that, especially

390
01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:40.199
directed to my wife. Um, just hearing that is like the worst possible word she's ever heard in her

391
01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:45.979
life. Does that make sense? But when you're called worse, stupid is nothing. Does that make sense?

392
01:03:46.919 --> 01:03:52.300
It's all, it all depends on what you're used to hearing. Yeah, it's, it's all, it all depends on

393
01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:59.370
what you have accepted and tolerated in terms of your communication with one another. And I've, I've,

394
01:03:59.379 --> 01:04:08.060
I've heard some people call each other atrocious names names that I would never even, uh, here in a

395
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:16.949
locker room as a sports chaplain. I've, I've heard couples speak this way to each other and, and I

396
01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:23.060
can't imagine what that's like to, to live that day in and day out and every time there's an

397
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:29.510
argument, it's like, it's like, oh, but you push me to that point and, but here's what happens the

398
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:38.010
moment that you allow that word or any word to be spoken in your household and to be spoken towards

399
01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:46.929
the person that you are in covenant with or establishing a future with. Then you can be certain that

400
01:04:46.939 --> 01:04:52.979
you are running into thorn bushes and walls instead of vineyards and gateways of hope isn't that

401
01:04:52.989 --> 01:05:01.159
clear? And so look at what it says here in terms of, don't ever call each other names in Ephesians

402
01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:09.169
chapter four. Look at verse 29 don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good,

403
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:16.300
let it be helpful so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them. Are you guys

404
01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:22.320
in agreement with this? And when we make this commitment that we can uphold the commitment in our

405
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:28.679
household, see, it takes one of us to say, I am going to stand by this, I am going to live by this.

406
01:05:28.689 --> 01:05:33.510
I'm going to do this and it's not going to be easy at first because we're going to have a pattern

407
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.520
that we may have to break a way that we've been accustomed to speaking to saying to expressing

408
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:43.669
ourselves in anger. And, and I think that's where we're going to have to be accountable to each

409
01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:50.459
other and, and, and encourage each other and say, hey, I know we agreed that we would not do this

410
01:05:50.469 --> 01:05:57.409
anymore and you just did it. And so we're not going to revert back to the things of the past. Let's

411
01:05:57.419 --> 01:06:03.969
stop talking this way right now, let's take a break from each other if we have to, let's table this

412
01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:10.719
conversation for another moment. But we are not going to speak to each other this way because we are

413
01:06:10.729 --> 01:06:20.649
both image bearers of God and we will not speak curses to one another. And if I curse you, I am

414
01:06:20.659 --> 01:06:21.870
cursing myself.

415
01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:31.649
And if I am not blessing you, I cannot be blessed. If I cannot cultivate an environment of blessing,

416
01:06:31.659 --> 01:06:38.909
then how is God going to move us forward to be able to accomplish the goals that we have for

417
01:06:38.919 --> 01:06:45.840
ourselves and for our relationship and for our family and for the bounty that we are trusting God

418
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:53.120
for the provision and the protection and the peace that we all desire to experience. And so if we

419
01:06:53.129 --> 01:06:59.139
make this commitment, then God has a place where these things can flourish. Here's number five, they

420
01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:08.080
don't snoop or spy out of mistrust. And I think that when we are doing this, when we are snooping,

421
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:14.000
when we're spying, there's also a level of mistrust there and it's probably warranted. There's

422
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:20.070
probably things that one of us has done. Listen, I don't know about you, but nobody wants to read my

423
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:20.879
emails

424
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.530
and if you do, you're going to have to work.

425
01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:35.219
Nobody who wants to read my text messages. There's nothing in them or my emails of interest, there's

426
01:07:35.229 --> 01:07:42.830
nothing there. You want my pass codes, I'll give it to everybody here. You want my browser history.

427
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:50.689
I will voluntarily offer that. I, I'm not worried about anyone spying on me. I'm not worried about

428
01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:55.040
my wife doing that. I'm not worried about my overseers doing that. I'm not worried about anyone in

429
01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:59.639
my congregation doing that. I'm not worried about that at all and I'll tell you why because you get

430
01:07:59.649 --> 01:08:08.149
to a place where you finally realize that there is no other place that you want to be in this world

431
01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:14.209
other than in the presence of the Lord, that is the best place.

432
01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:24.950
There is no greater place, there is no greater peace. There's nothing that this world can offer me,

433
01:08:24.959 --> 01:08:32.370
that is better than that presence. And believe me, I've tried it. I've tested it. I've gone out to

434
01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:37.350
experience it and I realize that there's nothing there but just more Brokenness and desolation.

435
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:43.438
There's just more desert. I don't know about you. But aren't you tired of the desert? Don't you want

436
01:08:43.449 --> 01:08:48.540
the vineyards in the gateway of hope to greater things? What God is saying is that? Why do you keep

437
01:08:48.549 --> 01:08:54.089
thinking you are going to find something in that desert? There's nothing there. Why do you keep

438
01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:00.399
thinking that you are going to smell roses that are better than the flowers you have when all you're

439
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:07.049
going to face are the thorn bushes instead? Why do you keep imagining that outside of what you have

440
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:14.979
is better when what I can do is turn around what you've got, I can multiply what you have. I can

441
01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:20.238
bless what I've already given you. I can make it better than anything out there. If you give me the

442
01:09:20.249 --> 01:09:26.479
opportunity, I will do exactly that. And the amazing thing about Hosea and Gomer is that God does

443
01:09:26.488 --> 01:09:27.219
that for them.

444
01:09:29.459 --> 01:09:36.640
He takes a story that is the most corrupt and the most broken in the scriptures and he gives them

445
01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:44.879
hope and then he restores them. And I don't want that to be us. I want us to experience that. And

446
01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:50.680
that's why these principles are so powerful. Look what it says. In Proverbs 11 3, there's a verse

447
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:57.319
for that and it says honesty guides good people, but this honesty always destroys treacherous people.

448
01:09:58.169 --> 01:10:02.899
And what God is saying is that if you got something to hide, the person who's gonna get destroyed is

449
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:08.729
you and, and, and you're going to be the person who's honest. So you don't worry about that because

450
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:12.990
they're going to be dishonest, they're going to destroy you. Yes, it's going to have some, some

451
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.390
blowback on you. But I want you to know that because you were honest and because you're honest, I'm

452
01:10:19.399 --> 01:10:24.109
going to keep blessing you and it's the other person who's going to have to deal with the

453
01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.700
consequences of that dishonesty.

454
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:34.160
OK. So this is really, really important. Here's number six, By the way, we're only going up to eight

455
01:10:34.169 --> 01:10:42.600
just in case you think I'm going to 10 or 12 Or 20 or 25. Let me give you a gateway of hope.

456
01:10:46.779 --> 01:10:53.899
Yeah, we are only going to eight and I'm getting quicker as I go. And so number six is, and here's

457
01:10:53.910 --> 01:11:00.870
important, really important one. Um, they don't lie to each other. Um, I remember the first point

458
01:11:00.879 --> 01:11:05.240
which was having difficult conversations. Sometimes we can have a,

459
01:13:41.589 --> 01:13:49.390
someone who falls alone is always going to be in real trouble. And so God says, this is what we're

460
01:13:49.399 --> 01:13:57.990
gonna have to look out for. Here's number eight, they don't take each other for granted. We want to

461
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.290
have a healthy relationship. You want to experience the valley of hope and, and the vineyards that

462
01:14:03.299 --> 01:14:08.160
God has promised and the abundance that comes from that. Well, it's going to happen if we don't take

463
01:14:08.169 --> 01:14:14.700
each other for granted. And in Ecclesiastes again, in chapter four, look at verse 11, it says two

464
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:23.910
people who lie close together can always keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? And

465
01:14:23.919 --> 01:14:25.290
don't say a heated blanket

466
01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:34.330
because I know we had that technology today. Um and we have other things that we could use. But

467
01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:45.359
verse 12 then says, a person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, But two can stand back to

468
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:55.169
back and they can conquer. three are even better. And that means that when Jesus is in there because

469
01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:06.680
it refers to a triple braided cord is not easily broken. And so you have strength together, not as

470
01:15:06.689 --> 01:15:13.779
opponents, but as teammates together. But more importantly, when Jesus is with you, you cannot be

471
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:19.709
broken. And so God says, like if you're in a relationship with someone and they're your opponent,

472
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.140
then you know, there's something desperately wrong. That's why you're not happy. That's why you

473
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:28.089
don't have joy. That's why you things are not progressing the way they should. But if you can be

474
01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.810
there for each other, the way that I want you to be, then this is what you can experience. And these

475
01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:38.169
eight principles that came out of the scriptures are also what people would agree and look at and

476
01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:44.540
say this is what is required to have a healthy relationship. And the wisdom of God and His

477
01:15:44.549 --> 01:15:51.390
scriptures is, is already there. It's in the relationship between Hosea and Gomer and it's in the

478
01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:56.589
relationship, wisdom that is found throughout the scriptures. And God is saying that if you take

479
01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.500
these things and you put them into practice right here right now, here's what's going to happen,

480
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:09.520
you're going to have a relationship that is always a gateway of hope. Well, God bless you guys.

481
01:16:09.529 --> 01:16:10.390
Thank you so much.

482
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:24.100
And um uh Chris and Esther, I see that you're there. Could you guys come up and we can pray for you?

483
01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:33.419
And uh I want to introduce to you Chris, um and Esther and um the family here is uh going to be uh

484
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:40.200
moving out of town and so we're really sad to see them go. Um, I know it's an emotional time for you

485
01:16:40.209 --> 01:16:47.790
guys as well as it is, uh, for us in seeing you do that and I know you guys are gonna be, you know,

486
01:16:47.799 --> 01:16:56.040
heading out in the next couple of weeks, I imagine. Is it ok, so it's even sooner they're leaving on

487
01:16:56.049 --> 01:17:05.370
Friday. And, um, and, uh, they both have taken jobs, um, up north and uh near, near the uh James Bay

488
01:17:05.479 --> 01:17:09.330
uh area. And what's the name? What's the name of the? Um

489
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:17.490
And, and you're, you're gonna be doing work in I T there and you're gonna be doing work as a, as a

490
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:25.660
nurse. And so, uh and you have a little boy, Elijah and he's going with you and I know this is like

491
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:30.799
a really tough and emotional thing for you guys, but also an adventure and, and an opportunity that

492
01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:38.240
God has brought to you and is providing uh for you. And what we wanted to do today is just to pray

493
01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:46.000
God's blessing over you as you go and you work um in this creation um in that town and be a part of

494
01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:56.259
that community and the light that God is gonna ask you to be um in whatever darkness you are in, but

495
01:17:56.270 --> 01:18:04.410
also to continue to be a light for each other and for your family and to, to keep doing what you

496
01:18:04.419 --> 01:18:12.080
have done here. Um um but in a new place and uh facing new challenges but, but God is going to be

497
01:18:12.089 --> 01:18:16.819
faithful. Um Would you just come a little closer as you would do that? And I wanna ask you guys to

498
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:24.149
stand with me as we would pray for them. And um if you're comfortable, would you, would you just uh

499
01:18:24.359 --> 01:18:33.279
put your hand out as a symbol of, of your heart uh towards this couple and, and their family and how

500
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:40.229
we can just pray for them. And so father, I pray for your hand of blessing on Chris and Esther and I

501
01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.549
thank you for Elijah and, and for the way that you have opened up this door for them to serve this

502
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:53.089
community to work in a place that is, that is far from family, friends and their church, but an

503
01:18:53.100 --> 01:19:00.259
opportunity for them to be able to do something that you've put on their hearts to do and you've led

504
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:06.180
them to make this decision and you have made it possible for them to walk through this door. And so

505
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:12.370
we just want to pray for your blessing on them and your protection on them as well. We want you to

506
01:19:12.379 --> 01:19:19.370
help them to be the best at what they do where they're going to do it and that you would continue to

507
01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:30.450
be for them and through them and be even because of them, a light that shines powerfully and

508
01:19:30.459 --> 01:19:36.529
communicates the light that is Jesus Christ. Lord. We just thank you for Chris and for Esther, we

509
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:42.910
thank you for their life together as a couple. How you brought them together, how you gave them the

510
01:19:42.919 --> 01:19:49.290
opportunity to be husband and wife. And how now you're leading them to establish their home and

511
01:19:49.299 --> 01:19:55.450
their household in a new community. Lord, whatever challenges they face, I pray that you would give

512
01:19:55.459 --> 01:20:03.129
them the victory over it in Jesus name and that you would continue to work powerfully in their life

513
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:10.959
as we pray for them and continue to pray for them. Even when they are not in our midst, they will

514
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:18.930
always be in yours. And so continue to be with them wherever they go in Jesus name, we pray. Amen.

515
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:28.729
Amen. God bless you guys. Thank you for your service as well and your community bless me. Thank you.

516
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:33.950
Let's see. So the worship team is going to sing one more song, remain standing as we would do that.

517
01:20:34.069 --> 01:20:39.470
And then Nate's gonna come dismiss us and then we're gonna have the community kitchen brunch. Can we

518
01:20:39.479 --> 01:20:44.299
give it up for the community kitchen again? And for an amazing meal we're gonna have. Thanks

519
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.810
everybody.

520
01:20:48.879 --> 01:20:54.930
We're gonna sing about God's amazing love from the verse, a famous verse that we should know John

521
01:20:54.939 --> 01:21:02.370
316 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that so whoever believed in him

522
01:21:03.419 --> 01:21:08.779
will not perish but have everlasting life. So let's sing a song about that beautiful verse,

523
01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:11.560
bad

524
01:22:48.109 --> 01:22:50.259
dream addictions

525
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:58.750
of the crowd. Jesus is we

526
01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:27.990
please.

527
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.430
