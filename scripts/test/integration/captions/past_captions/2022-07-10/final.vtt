6
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:26.930
message is based on the parable of the lost son and it's based on restore to multiply because God

Okay let's welcome Pastor Lorenzo for the rest of our service.

106
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.130
After party, I'd love to connect with you and we're so glad that you're a part of this gathering

107
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:52.230
today. We are going to be continuing our series called Multiply and we are looking at the stories of

108
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:58.630
multiplication in the scriptures as Jesus has presented them to us the way that he's teaching us and

109
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:06.930
showing us how we can take these very practical principles put them in place in our own lives to

110
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:13.930
experience. Also the multiplication that we so desire. Now one of the things we want is a blessed

111
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:21.650
life, but when we don't understand the principles in receiving that blessed life and experiencing

112
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:27.470
that blessed life, it's gonna be a challenge for all of us to be able to live that. And so that what

113
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:33.300
the scriptures do and what Jesus does is that he doesn't want to leave us in the dark regarding

114
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:41.650
these things, he teaches these things to us like we are his friends and he wants us to be friends,

115
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:51.060
he wants us to be in a friendship relationship with him and he wants to be able to reveal those

116
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:59.840
secrets and those principles that will bring about multiplication in our lives. And so the disciples

117
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.130
had this incredible relationship with Jesus and being able to be with him and speak to him and then

118
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:14.230
hear from him and that's the kind of relationship that we are still attaining and wanting to have in

119
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:21.690
our own lives. And so don't feel like that is far removed from the reality and the possibility of

120
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:28.810
what you can experience because that's God's heart, that's his intention and that's what Jesus wants

121
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:36.050
for each of us. And so today we're going to look at the third parable in the things that were lost

122
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:43.190
that Jesus wanted us to understand Could once again be found. And today we're gonna look in Luke

123
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:54.310
chapter 15 and read from verse 11 to then all the way through to verse 32. And so this passage that

124
00:27:54.310 --> 00:28:00.290
we're about to look at is um an important one because it reveals not just the heart of the father,

125
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:07.610
but it's Jesus's response to the religious leaders and when they were making accusations towards him

126
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:15.950
about why he was spending this time with notorious sinners as they were seen and understood to be,

127
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:22.600
Jesus wanted them to understand these things. And so in the scriptures, it's very important that you

128
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:28.840
understand this principle is that Jesus, when he wanted to emphasize something, he would say it

129
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:36.140
three times. And so the reason there are three parables is because he wants the same subject to

130
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:42.960
become deeply ingrained in our understanding of what multiplication looks like when things are lost.

131
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:50.570
And so there's going to be a progression that is going to be seen in the story. That is also a deep

132
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:57.880
reflection of how Jesus knows that this is going to be difficult, not only for the religious leaders

133
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.780
to understand this, but for us to be able to understand it, for us to be able to accept this to

134
00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:13.340
believe it, to somehow accept that this is the truth by which we can live by. So for Jesus to repeat

135
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:20.840
this three times, he knows how difficult it's going to be for us to believe in this multiplication

136
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:28.520
principle because all of us have experienced loss. And it's difficult to believe that those things

137
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:35.170
which are lost can be found again through the blessing of the multiplication that Jesus is promising.

138
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:43.640
And so for him to say it once through the sheep, twice through the lost coin. Now he's talking to us

139
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:50.590
the third time, but he's doing it through the lost son. Okay, that was a long introduction. I

140
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:56.710
apologize, but I felt like I needed to just make that really clear and as clear as I could possibly

141
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:02.720
make it because I didn't want you to miss what comes next. So now we can read. Okay, verse 11. Thank

142
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:10.560
you. So to illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story Of a man who had two sons and

143
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:16.500
the younger son told his father I want my share of your state now before you die. And so his father

144
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:23.980
agrees to divide his wealth between his sons. And a few days later this younger son packed all his

145
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:30.430
belongings and he moved to a distant land and there he wasted all his money in wild living and about

146
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:36.360
the time that his money right now the great famine also swept over the land and he began to starve

147
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.960
and he persuaded a local farmer to hire him and the man sent him into the fields to feed his pigs

148
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:50.130
and the young man became so hungry that even the pods, he was feeding the pigs looked good to him,

149
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:55.820
but no him, no one gave him anything to eat. And when he finally came to his senses he said to

150
00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:04.170
himself at home. Even the hired servants have food enough to spare. And here I am dying of hunger. I

151
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:10.860
will go home to my father and say, Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you and I'm no

152
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:18.050
longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant. And so he returned

153
00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.200
home to his father and while he was still a long way off his father saw him coming and he was filled

154
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:30.180
with love and compassion. And your auntie's son. He embraced him and kissed him and his son said to

155
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:36.200
him, Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you and I'm no longer worthy of being called your

156
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.630
son. But his father said to the servants, quick bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him.

157
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:49.720
Get a ring for his finger, and then sandals for his feet and kill the calf that we have been

158
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:57.210
fattening. We must celebrate with a feast for this son of mine was dead and now he has returned to

159
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:05.020
life he was lost. But now he is found. So the party began. And meanwhile the older son was in the

160
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:10.650
fields working and when he returned home he heard music and dancing in the house and he asked one of

161
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:16.290
the servants what was going on. Your brother is back, he was told, and your father has killed the

162
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:22.360
fattened calf. And we are celebrating because of his safe return. And the older brother was angry

163
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:28.170
and wouldn't go in and his father came out and then begged him. But he replied all these years, I've

164
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:33.420
slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you

165
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:39.310
never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends. Yeah, when this son of yours comes

166
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:45.940
back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fatted calf. And his

167
00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:52.550
father said to him, look dear son, you have always stayed by me and everything I have is yours. We

168
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:58.320
had to celebrate this happy day for your brother was dead and he has come back to life. He was lost.

169
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:06.280
But now he is found now in the story that we have just read is a story that is probably incredibly

170
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:13.000
well known to each of us. But the word Prodigal itself is not a word that we sometimes use quite

171
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:19.790
commonly in our own english language. Yet the word Prodigal means being wasteful in a very

172
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:28.000
extravagant manner. And so when we talk about this son and what he did, it means that he really

173
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.010
squandered everything that God had given him. And I think that we've all, I think regretted some

174
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:40.750
things in our life. We've all regretted decisions. We've seen sometimes how we could have received

175
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:48.400
an investment in our in our in our possession, given money, given time and talent and and somehow

176
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:57.830
not lived up to the potential with which we knew we had at that time and with regret. We look upon

177
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:04.960
those moments and we wonder what our life could have been like. Had we not lived a certain way? And

178
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:11.040
that's what the story is really about. It's about living with that regret and and and understanding

179
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:17.630
that as we live with that regret, what a challenge it is for each of us to somehow understand that

180
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:23.790
God has something more to speak to us about than just the regret that we may be feeling and

181
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:31.770
experiencing in our life right now, Jesus, as I mentioned earlier spoke these three parables because

182
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:40.520
he wanted to emphasize his response and his response is one that they were shocked by it's the

183
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:47.930
response that there is nothing that is lost that cannot be found again. And in their minds when

184
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:53.770
something was lost, it was lost. If you were outside of God's favor, then you were outside of his

185
00:34:53.770 --> 00:35:01.190
favor. If if you turned your back on God, then there was no way to come back to God. If you were put

186
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:08.260
outside of the walls of the city, there was no way that you could ever use any of the doors to come

187
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:18.080
back in. So whatever you did, that was your fate and it was sealed forever. There was nothing that

188
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:25.770
could be done for someone like the people that Jesus was spending time with and what Jesus wanted

189
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:33.510
them to understand was that wasn't true, That wasn't the case, It wasn't what was actually happening

190
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:41.640
in God's eyes and it certainly wasn't going to be reflected in Jesus's life. And so Jesus went where

191
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:52.630
God's heart was obviously always at. And so the heavenly father in the story is the father who when

192
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:59.630
the sun comes to him and demands his inheritance, he says, if that's what you want, then that's what

193
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:10.190
I will give you. And that teaches us that our decisions are ours, that that God allows us to make

194
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:17.300
our decisions to make our choices to go in the direction that we want to go in to do the things that

195
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:25.150
we desire to do, and he's not going to hold us back from doing it. And that's crazy to me, because I

196
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:31.140
would imagine that this story should have had a part in it, where the father does everything in his

197
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:39.660
power to persuade the son to stay home, where he could have made that clear at any point in the

198
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:48.860
parable, at any point, he could have said, and I did my best to teach and to show and to reveal to

199
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:59.170
my son what what happened. How did just listen to me, then this would not have happened. But it

200
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:10.540
never happens in the story because what we need to understand is that God gives us and he gives it

201
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.510
freely

202
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.160
and there are no strings attached.

203
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:30.450
What he entrusts us with is what we have been given and it's up to us to do something with that. And

204
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:37.300
so what God does is that he shows us in the story what it looks like when this happens now.

205
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:43.490
Something to understand because we are talking about multiplication is that there is a mathematical

206
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:52.540
progression in the story and we see that there is a lost fraction, one sheep out of 99. And then it

207
00:37:52.540 --> 00:38:03.450
increases from 100 to 1 10. So there's one coin out of 10 and then to one half of the whole there is

208
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:12.660
one son out of two. And what what Jesus does is intentional here he's showing that we can go to

209
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:22.450
something that has very little value, Has value. But in comparison to the 99 it has the least value.

210
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:30.710
And then that value increases when it goes to the one coin out of 10 And then it increases even more

211
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:37.970
when it's one son out of two. And so what God wants us to understand is that even in the story

212
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:45.910
there's a progression and he wants the Pharisees and the religious leaders and and the audience to

213
00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:53.040
understand that this is how God wants us to see it. That this progression isn't that there are

214
00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:00.270
things that have little value and more value but that when you're emphasizing a point, you go from

215
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:07.820
the smallest value to the highest value, but you're teaching the same thing and what Jesus is

216
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:20.780
teaching is that there is this value of each loss that rises from a sheep to a coin to a son. So you

217
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:29.730
get to the point where you realize that all of a sudden, of course the Sun, you don't want to lose a

218
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:39.500
son If you lose a sheep out of one out of 99, well, you deal with the loss. If you lose one coin out

219
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:46.320
of 10, will you at least you still have nine. But if you lose one son out of two, that is an

220
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:56.680
irreplaceable loss. And yet God reveals the celebration in each, but he highlights how in the story,

221
00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:06.220
the sun recklessly and wastefully spends his inheritance. And in my mind when you waste an

222
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:13.730
inheritance. The idea is that you cannot get that inheritance back. The idea being that if I

223
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:21.620
received it already and I've lost it and I've squandered it by my bad choices and by my evil living,

224
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:30.090
then I cannot have that restored. And yet in the story that is not what Jesus is communicating, it's

225
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:38.380
an assumption that we're making, which is why he goes about making it clear that this son gets back

226
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:46.200
his position in the family, he wanted to come back and be a servant, but God shows us that he

227
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:55.350
doesn't just want a servant again, he wants a son and that son had an inheritance, he had a position

228
00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:04.040
he had a role in the family. And that's why he gives him the robe. That's why he puts a ring on his

229
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:14.290
finger, he puts a ring and that's why he restores onto him the honor of once again being found. The

230
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:19.930
brother of course is upset by this and and the brother is a reflection of the jewish nation and and

231
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:26.810
the trouble that they saw in all of this, They didn't like that God was out there restoring that he

232
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:32.400
was giving back people's inheritance and positions. They didn't want to see that they wanted to

233
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:39.010
continue to believe that when one was lost, he could never be found again. And so these people who

234
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:46.700
found themselves lost just gathered with other lost people and they just sat and they ate together

235
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:53.150
and they laughed at the fact that they were lost and they would rejoice in the fact that they were

236
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.800
lost. They would have parties about the fact that they were lost. They were saying to each other

237
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:05.130
that, well everyone else in the nation has found where the lost ones and they were like a badge of

238
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:14.810
honor. And what Jesus went to show them was that being lost is not an honor. It's not where you need

239
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:21.750
to live, it's not where you need to stay. And while it feels like you are making money and living

240
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:28.260
your best life and partying and you have friends at your table and you're participating and

241
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:35.570
partaking in all that this friendship may have to offer, I want you to know that even in this

242
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:45.000
setting you are still lost. But I'm here to help you be found. I look at how God came to rescue all

243
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:54.220
of us in the areas of our life where we thought we were okay, where we believed we didn't need him,

244
00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:04.080
where we somehow convinced ourselves that we could continue to be lost. But Jesus didn't let that

245
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:11.890
happen. He made sure that he came after us so that we would understand the difference between being

246
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:20.840
lost. The way that the religious system sees us and lost. The way that God sees us instead, and the

247
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:29.430
way that God sees us when we're lost is that we can always be found that we can always be rescued.

248
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:36.380
But there's something important in this story that we sometimes lose sight of and that is what

249
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:46.010
happens when the sun is squandering, Jesus is teaching us that God the father's love for each of us

250
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:53.090
is incredibly astounding. And that was the point that Jesus was trying to make and make really clear,

251
00:43:53.100 --> 00:44:05.220
he wanted everybody to feel the the astonishment of this love, this love that he had because in the

252
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:09.940
following verse that I want to put up on the screen, it says that Father, I have sinned against

253
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:15.260
heaven and in those days they didn't like to say the word God, it was too holy to even pronounce

254
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.480
with their own lips. So they used to say heaven. So the word Heaven here is actually the word God,

255
00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:30.540
but because he's so broken and feels so lost and far from God and he feels so unclean and unworthy,

256
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:38.580
he won't even say the word. And so he replaces it with heaven. And then he says in your sight, I am

257
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:46.410
no longer worthy to be called your son. So what happens in this story? What happens is repentance?

258
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:56.130
And and I think that many of us want multiplication without repentance. We want the blessing without

259
00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:07.810
having to say to God that we need to admit where it is that we have failed him. Now, there were

260
00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:14.730
times early on in my spiritual journey where I knew the things that I needed to confess that I

261
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:23.400
needed to bring to God. God had found me where I was lost. And he helped me to be found in his

262
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:30.870
presence again. And in that time I remember being so clear about what I needed to profess what I

263
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:38.170
needed to confess what I needed to repent of. And as I did that I could sense burdens being lifted

264
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:48.000
from me. And then there were times during this period of my early repentance that God was speaking

265
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.740
to me in dreams about things that I had forgotten or he was bringing to remembrance while I was

266
00:45:53.740 --> 00:46:01.820
working or talking to people or situations that were really in the moment, not about the moment that

267
00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:08.010
had happened, but God somehow brought it together to show me something that I had forgotten about

268
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:14.940
that I needed to repent of the Holy Spirit was bringing things to to memory and and he wasn't doing

269
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:20.200
it to judge me or to condemn me, but because he knew there were still lessons that I needed to learn.

270
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:26.710
And the only way that I could learn them and understand them is that if he showed me the attitude of

271
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:35.620
my heart at that time, if he revealed to me what I was thinking and doing and why the motivation

272
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:43.540
behind those actions, just so that I would never go back to such a place and what I've learned is

273
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:53.980
that God still does that no matter how far from the moment was that we first were found that that

274
00:46:53.980 --> 00:47:00.030
there are still things that God wants to bring to our attention and to our remembrance. And so there

275
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:07.390
were certain things that this young man was able to pronounce, say out loud, tell others about. He

276
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:15.590
was able to tell his father when he came back what he realized. But the realization didn't come on

277
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:25.040
the road back, it came when he was in the Pigpen. It came when he wasn't able to have any food to

278
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:32.770
eat when he saw that the pigs were eating better than him in that moment he made his first

279
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:39.760
realizations and it brought him to the first steps of repentance. And I want you to see that there's

280
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.830
something beautiful about this because even though he probably didn't realize everything, he

281
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:55.300
realized enough to bring them back to his senses and enough to bring him back to the father for God

282
00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.900
to be able to restore him. Bless him and then bring about multiplication in his life. Can we say

283
00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:08.000
amen to that? Like just think about that. He didn't realize everything, but he realized enough and

284
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:16.280
that's true for us. So the realizations we've made sometimes we think that those are enough to now

285
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:27.290
experience multiplication, but you cannot reap what you do not. So there is no way that you can

286
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:36.010
experience multiplication if you do not sow the seeds of repentance first. And so there are things

287
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:42.200
that are blocking my multiplication from happening because there are areas of my life that I have

288
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:48.500
not repented of. Yet there are things that I have not confessed things that I have not realized

289
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:54.100
things that I have not had a breakthrough in. And so what we should be doing is should be asking God.

290
00:48:54.100 --> 00:49:02.720
God revealed to me that which is hidden. Show me that which I do not see show me that which I still

291
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:09.790
need to confess that which I still need to repent of reveal that which is hidden from me so that I

292
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:17.990
can once again experience your multiplication. And when we do that, then God is going to be able to

293
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:26.330
bring about a multiplication. But you cannot experience multiplication unless you repent first. And

294
00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:34.590
then the father can then restore you because God's desire is for us to repent, be reconciled to him

295
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:44.830
be restored. And then we can multiply. And so what the story does is that it reveals the steps. So

296
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.480
if you want multiplication, when you've got to start with repentance, then you've got to be

297
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:55.830
reconciled. You have to be restored and in that restoration. Now you can experience multiplication.

298
00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:04.330
The blessing that you're looking for begins first with repentance, not a popular word, right? It's

299
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:10.040
not something we want to do. We want multiplication, We want blessing, but we want to have to go

300
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:16.620
through all these steps. But here's the beautiful thing about it. The realizations that we make

301
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:25.690
always lead to a greater blessing than could ever have been imagined when the sun returns to the

302
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:35.680
father, he is so appreciative that the father is there, welcome him back. Because what we see in the

303
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:45.940
story is that every day, even though he didn't know it, The father is eagerly watching and waiting

304
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:55.670
for his son's return on the road. Every day. The father would go out and every day he would look for

305
00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:02.880
him. The sun didn't think that was happening when he found himself in that pig pen. And and he

306
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:08.080
thought, you know, my servant of the servants in my father's house lived better than me. Maybe he'll

307
00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:13.000
take me back as a servant, he never would have imagined that his father would be waiting for him on

308
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:21.260
the road. But that's the love of God. That's how much God loves us. He's every day waiting for us

309
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:28.840
and every day he wants for the repentance to lead to the reconciliation to the restoration and then

310
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:36.140
to the multiplication. God's intention is always to lead us to multiplication. That's his heart. But

311
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:43.630
he knows that can't happen unless we are first reconciled and restored. So when you think about your

312
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:48.410
relationship with God, you have to think about the things that are standing in the way of that. The

313
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:54.000
things that have been holding you back from that. The things that God wants to remove so that you

314
00:51:54.010 --> 00:52:01.120
can live that out. That's why in verse 20 it says this. But when he was still a great way off, his

315
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:10.100
father saw him and had compassion and then he ran and he fell on his neck and he kissed him. The

316
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:16.220
bible reminds us that that's the actions of a father. That it doesn't matter where you've been. It

317
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:22.470
doesn't matter what you've done. What's important is that you've come back. But here's the important

318
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:27.180
part the sun had to come back to the father. That's the repentance.

319
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:37.010
You see, I want God to bless me without ever having to repent. But you see, Jesus is always a

320
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:43.800
representation of how he's on the road. Like how how he's always able to receive us the way we are

321
00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:51.630
and when we're on that road coming back to him, what happens is that the father in the story runs to

322
00:52:51.630 --> 00:53:00.050
the sun. He runs to the sun. The sun doesn't have to run to the father. It's the father who takes

323
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:07.550
off running towards the sun. Can we say amen to that. That's how much God loves us. I need you to

324
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.380
picture God running to you

325
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:19.350
wherever you are, whatever situation you're in, I want you to picture not just God waiting for you

326
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:25.560
on the road, but for the way that he is able to run to you, that's how much he loves you.

327
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:35.510
I had a hard time accepting that. Had a hard time believing that had a hard time trusting that that

328
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:43.700
could be true for me. But the moment I began to believe that is the moment I also began to

329
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:56.080
understand multiplication. When you understand your position robed ringed and once again restored as

330
00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:04.620
a son, then you know that you can never be anything other than what you were always brought in this

331
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:11.640
world to be and that is a son and a daughter of the king. And when you understand that, then you

332
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:19.960
understand your value, your worth and your position because an inheritance in this story is restored.

333
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:29.550
A feast is planned and there is rejoicing when that which is lost is finally found. I want to

334
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:39.410
imagine a moment in your life where God is bringing about incredible blessing and restoration and

335
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:46.920
reconciliation because the inheritance that we may have squandered has been brought back to us. We

336
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.870
don't want to be the other son in the story at any point. The other son in the story is is a

337
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:59.470
reflection of what you're not supposed to be like. It's not an indication of of what we're supposed

338
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:06.930
to strive for. In fact, God is trying to show us that. The other son in the story is someone who

339
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:10.050
believes they never do anything wrong.

340
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:20.120
But look at how when the party starts and this is important. The Sun isn't even in the house

341
00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:29.530
when the feast began, the other son was still out in the field, he was so far removed from what was

342
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:37.570
happening. That when he finally shows up, we understand why he was so far removed because his

343
00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:45.420
attitude is so bad. It's so wrong in every imaginable way. But God sees the good even in that

344
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:53.920
attitude. He sees even in that wrong attitude, the things that the sun did do that, we're right and

345
00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:00.930
he highlights those things and he begs him come in and celebrate even though the other son won't do

346
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:08.970
it, he still tries to get him to join the party because he wants him to understand that things that

347
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:18.850
are lost can be found. But when they're found, they need to be celebrated. And if we don't

348
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:26.590
understand that God celebrates over us and and and the changes that come about in our lives that

349
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:35.950
every time we step out in a way that maybe brings about a loss that he is able to still bring us

350
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:44.030
back through the repentance that we talked about through the restoration that he wants to make

351
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:51.210
happen in our lives, so that we can then experience the multiplication. Where is it that you feel

352
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:56.040
that God can't reach you? Where is it that you feel that God cannot

353
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:08.280
bring that which is lost and make it found. Where is it that you're convinced that God can't

354
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.650
celebrate over you?

355
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:22.200
But there can't be this kind of feast and feasting for your life. Where is it that you believe that

356
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:31.550
you don't deserve this? Because we just heard from Jesus himself telling us that we all do.

357
00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:35.960
And so even if you

358
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:48.700
don't believe it, even if you can't see it, even if there's someone in your life telling you other

359
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:55.660
than you that you don't deserve it. This story is for you.

360
00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:05.420
God wants to bring about multiplication in your life today, but it's going to come through the road

361
00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:12.030
of repentance, we're going to get reconciled, we're going to get restored and we're gonna begin to

362
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:18.700
see the blessings of God, like never before are you ready for that in your life, Are you ready to

363
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:25.180
take those steps? And so I want to ask that you would just stand and as you would do that, I want

364
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:32.910
you to think of something that, that you know right now, you need to repent of something that you

365
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:34.950
just need to ask God sorry for.

366
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:43.860
And and as you would do that, I want you to know that immediately God is going to reconcile you to

367
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:52.250
himself through the person of Jesus. It's going to happen instantaneously at the moment that you say,

368
00:58:52.690 --> 00:59:01.230
Lord forgive me. Lord, I'm sorry Lord. I repent that in that moment. You are reconciled once again

369
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:08.770
through Jesus christ back to the father. In that moment you are restored. So, I want you to imagine

370
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:18.300
yourself now in that restoration. And I want you to see yourself in that place where he is putting a

371
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:29.180
robe on your shoulders. He's putting a ring of authority on your finger that he's telling you, your

372
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:37.750
inheritance has been restored, where he's calling you a son and a daughter again, that you are once

373
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:46.010
again ready to experience multiplication. And so, father, as we come before you and as you have made

374
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:55.270
these things incredibly vivid and real for each of us for the way that you have given us a visual

375
00:59:55.270 --> 01:00:04.550
understanding of the story of that which was lost and how it is now found for how it speaks to each

376
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:11.580
of us in our own individual journeys. And we think of maybe relationships that was lost and health

377
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:21.220
that may have been lost, A family that was lost. maybe even a son or a daughter or who knows what

378
01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:28.330
else, tragically and traumatically has happened in our lives that whatever it is that we've been

379
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:33.990
through, whatever it is that we've gone through, that we can't picture or imagine that we could

380
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:41.470
possibly be blessed again Lord in this moment we know that that is not true. Your word has spoken

381
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:49.120
clearly about what it is that you are able to do. And so in this moment, father, if there's anything

382
01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:55.850
that we're doing to prohibit your multiplication and we want to confess that right now, we want to

383
01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:03.510
ask that you would forgive us that you would set us free from this. That you would not allow any of

384
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:10.250
this to hold us back from what you have in store for us. Thank you for who you are and what you've

385
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:18.420
done for each of us today and for what you're about to do in terms of the multiplication that we are

386
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:26.070
anticipating and expecting to experience in our lives. Lord, you're about to do something incredible

387
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:35.820
for each of us. And there is a celebration both in heaven and on earth right now for how you are

388
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:47.120
telling us and all those around us that which was lost is now found. We pray this in Jesus' name.

389
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:53.680
Amen. Amen. I pray that blesses you and encourages you guys on your spiritual journey. Thank you so

390
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:59.190

391
01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:05.520
