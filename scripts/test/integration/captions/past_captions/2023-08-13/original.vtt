1
00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:59.799
All right, good stuff. Well, good morning and welcome. We're so glad that you're with us. Thank you

2
00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:05.019
for being here on a beautiful summer day and being a part of this experience, we're looking forward

3
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:11.320
to the fall, but right now, let's enjoy the summer. And I'm sure as you take the opportunity to take

4
00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:20.359
in the breaks that you get in this season that God has a way of providing rest for you even in his

5
00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:27.040
house, when we come and gather in His name and we come to worship Him. He provides a measure and a

6
00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:34.720
level of rest that we can't experience no matter where that vacation may take place. When we come

7
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:42.059
into the presence of God, he nourishes our soul. He revives and restores us. He has the ability to

8
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:49.290
remind us of his redemptive power, not just in the areas where we need it, but in the areas where we

9
00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:56.260
might. It's not just about dealing with the past, but it's about how He has the ability to help us

10
00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:03.429
in our present and then help redefine what our future is going to be like. Do you believe that

11
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:10.239
together today as we gather in his name, we can just unburden ourselves before him, whatever it is

12
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:16.890
that is weighing heavy on your heart. It's, it's a burden that we can just bring before him and just

13
00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:22.709
let him carry when we're not able to do it. And so I want to remind you that today is the day in

14
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.839
which the youth are meeting at 10 a.m. We have our kids program which normally starts at 10 30. But

15
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.070
we have so many teachers away today that we have just a station that's set up at the back and we're

16
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.549
going to dismiss the kids after the worship this morning. And then we have a wonderful gathering

17
00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:45.719
that's planned for you as we continue with our getting their series. And today we're going to be

18
00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:51.969
talking about unwanted disaster, but we want to worship together. And right now we have the river's

19
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:58.250
edge worship team that has prepared for this gathering and they're ready to lead us in that time.

20
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:04.119
We're going to sing a few songs together. And as we do, these are going to be promises and reminders

21
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:10.429
from the scriptures of how we can continue to put our faith and trust in the Lord. And so I want to

22
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.820
invite you to stand with me as we just open in a word of prayer as we commit ourselves. And this

23
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:23.179
gathering to God, where is it that you need God to work in your life? Where is it that you need him

24
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:29.650
to do something new for you. And maybe he's already in the process of doing that. But he can do so

25
00:09:29.659 --> 00:09:35.489
much more as we just take those steps together right now. Father, I thank you that as we gather in

26
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:42.369
your presence when we mention things and even when we're maybe too emotional to even utter them,

27
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:49.580
sometimes we don't even know how to describe it. It's more of a feeling and less something that we

28
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:56.099
can articulate. Lord, whatever the situation and the circumstances are, even if we're able to

29
00:09:56.109 --> 00:10:03.200
clearly declare together today in this space, what it is that we need you to do. Lord, I pray that

30
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:10.289
you would still intercede for us. You know what it is that we're asking. But you also know what it

31
00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:19.340
is that we truly need, you know, when we need it, you know how we will have it met in our lives. And

32
00:10:19.349 --> 00:10:25.219
I pray that today would be a day where we can grow in our faith and our trust of you that you would

33
00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:34.119
show us in this day how you are still powerful and faithful to each of us. And I pray your blessing

34
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:41.090
on every person here on all those watching on all those that have been a part of this community and

35
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:47.640
are a part of this community. All the churches that are gathering in your name all over this city.

36
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:55.710
We pray a special blessing on them and on your people as we worship you together today and we pray

37
00:10:55.719 --> 00:11:01.820
these things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Can you welcome the River's Edge worship team with me.

38
00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:11.770
We're gonna sing the song "King of All." Let us all worship our Lord and Savior and just tell him what

39
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.619
a king He is. Hallelujah.

40
00:11:44.719 --> 00:11:47.880
one. It's every morning.

41
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.770
You have it.

42
00:11:59.119 --> 00:11:59.169
OK?

43
00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:09.109
No need. It's victor.

44
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:26.929
You are my strength.

45
00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:00.700
Every desert you love makes

46
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:05.900
bring

47
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.640
I feel

48
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.419

49
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.109

50
00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:32.960
she got.

51
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.409
I think this is

52
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.369
free guy. Hey,

53
00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:34.969
let's sing of the goodness of God

54
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.359

00:16:45.119 --> 00:17:00.799
Yeah, know you're me now. Else kindle my days I've been held in your and from the moment that away

58
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:17.849
Bye.

59
00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:25.958
You have.

60
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.880

00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:36.199
you and

63
00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:41.510
we never,

64
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:48.219
the next song is called Won't Stop now. And sometimes we're waiting for a breakthrough. We're

65
00:20:48.229 --> 00:20:53.130
praying God for a breakthrough and we want it right away. But we have to understand it's not in our

66
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:59.640
time, it's in God's time. And this song is telling us his promise that he will never stop for us. He

67
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.849
will. If he makes a promise, he's gonna keep it. So let's listen to something.

68
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.189
And now one for, yeah,

69
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:34.709
I'm moving

70
00:21:41.849 --> 00:21:46.000
our one four party.

71
00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:50.260
You

72
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.800
know a breakthrough.

73
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.869
Let's sing the chorus.

74
00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:24.270
We want you.

75
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:29.319
Yeah.

76
00:25:33.229 --> 00:25:33.560
Yeah,

78
00:25:41.949 --> 00:25:42.619

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.500

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.339
yeah,

81
00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:19.699
Thank you worship team. That was amazing. I just gonna share some quick announcements with you.

82
00:26:19.709 --> 00:26:26.459
The first being that we have a youth uh pool party and it's happening on Sunday, August the 20th.

83
00:26:26.469 --> 00:26:32.729
And so if anybody is interested in that, just speak to one of our youth leaders, you can always get

84
00:26:32.739 --> 00:26:37.709
information at our info point, which is right in front of the sound booth. And so if you don't know

85
00:26:37.719 --> 00:26:42.209
who to direct your attention to or you don't know who the people are that are in charge of these uh

86
00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:47.849
events and ministries, you can just go there and they'll help you with that. And then we also have

87
00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:55.489
our women's Ministry, which is called Girls and it's for women over the age of 18. And we have a, a

88
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:02.790
wonderful event that is planned uh on August the 26th, which is a Saturday. And this event is a

89
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:12.500
continuation of the other unlikely royalty event that we had uh where the topic and the character of

90
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:19.660
Tamar was visited by uh Patricia as she gave the teaching. If you missed that event, you missed uh

91
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:26.900
an incredible uh moment um in our women's ministry here and we want to encourage you to make it out

92
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:33.250
for the next one. There's a sign up sheet that's available at the info point again and you can just

93
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.180
put your name down. So we know how many people to prepare for because there's a lot of food that's

94
00:27:38.189 --> 00:27:43.969
going to be made available, uh tea and different types of uh pastries and scones and things like

95
00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:49.890
that. And you're getting together as well for teaching and worship. And that's happening on Saturday,

96
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:57.439
August the 26th. We also have been announcing our guys camping trip and the guys camping trip has

97
00:27:57.449 --> 00:28:03.390
now turned into a Saturday retreat and it's not because guys don't want to sleep on the ground in

98
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:10.260
the tent when it can possibly rain with a lot of bugs and things like that. Those yes, are all my

99
00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:18.189
concerns but, um, it had absolutely no bearing on the decision to shorten the event. So we're going

100
00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:23.329
to go up for this Saturday and we're just gonna have a good time. Um, we're gonna end up doing a

101
00:28:23.339 --> 00:28:28.459
worship night and as well, a worship day with a speaker that we're bringing in. His name is Sean.

102
00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:33.859
And, uh, he's gonna give us a great word from the Lord. We're gonna be able to also have some fun up

103
00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:40.000
there, uh, doing other things. Um, but we're, we're gonna just let, um, Paul explain all that to you

104
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:44.280
guys. Uh, you can meet Paul at the info point as well and he's going to take your name down if you

105
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:50.619
need a lift to get up there. Um, then you can also let him know and he will um, give you uh some

106
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.010
information on that. We have enough cars going up. We can definitely, uh round up guys and just go

107
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.420
up together and it's going to be a great opportunity if you haven't been a part of anything that

108
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.890
we've done so far with the guys ministry. Uh This is gonna be a great thing for you guys to be a

109
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.750
part of and it's just for the Saturday, we just go up and so more info uh at the booth, we also have

110
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.290
four ways that you can give. We just want to thank everyone for your contributions, your donations

111
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.270
um for your sacrificial giving for the donations that have come in um that have made it possible for

112
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:25.209
us to just operate week to week and, and just to be able to um keep making repairs to the building.

113
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:31.550
Um you know, just doing these ministries, funding the activities and, and all the things that take

114
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.890
um money to make this place work. It comes through your generosity. And so thank you for that. And

115
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.660
there are several ways that you can give. We have a app as well as a Canada helps app that you can

116
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:48.349
use. Um We're a registered charity so we can offer donations. And when you do all you have to do is

117
00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:53.560
fill up one of those envelopes and let us know what that donation is, put all your information down

118
00:29:53.569 --> 00:30:00.479
so we can give you a tax receipt. And, uh, we thank you for your donation in advance. We also have

119
00:30:00.489 --> 00:30:05.290
the after party today. At the end of the gathering, we have a lot of beverages that, uh, have been

120
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:11.719
prepared for you. Some cold drinks as well as some, uh, sweet treats that you guys can partake in.

121
00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:19.359
And, uh, we're now going to just transition into, uh, the message which today is called unwanted

122
00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:23.869
disaster. Let's just watch this bumper and, um, we'll continue with the gathering.

123
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:17.459
It is with fast food places and broken ice cream machines. But I'm enraged anybody else. I don't

124
00:31:17.469 --> 00:31:22.199
know what it is. It's like every time you try to get an ice cream, the machine is broken. I don't

125
00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:27.119
know if just those kids just don't want to make it, you know, or somebody in there that just, you

126
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:33.239
know, doesn't want to make the extra effort. But the machine is always broken. I remember when I was

127
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:38.060
a young man, like, uh my dad had a grocery store and, uh just, you know, he just wanted to try

128
00:31:38.069 --> 00:31:46.030
something different and, and he had a lot of Italian products and we were, um, in a, and, uh, we

129
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:52.170
weren't far off from, from Chabanel Street. I don't know if you know that area. Um, but that's where, um,

130
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:57.270
there were a lot of Italians living in that area and so my dad opened up a store and, and we were,

131
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:04.339
you know, basically working in the store from, I guess, from, from when we were about grade five and

132
00:32:04.349 --> 00:32:10.589
we were, I know it sounds weird. Um, but that's just how it is in Italian families. Um, you just

133
00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:16.150
start working early. And before that, my dad was in construction and he continued to be in

134
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.359
construction. But then he opened the store and put my mom in there because he felt like she was not

135
00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:28.520
doing enough of her life. And so so we all then had to migrate from doing construction to then being

136
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.180
in this grocery store. And so we learned how to, how to just do everything. And then every once in a

137
00:32:32.189 --> 00:32:37.869
while, my dad would just add something new. And he decided one day without consulting anyone because

138
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.290
again, he was Italian,

139
00:32:41.439 --> 00:32:47.150
he was going to put in an ice cream machine. And so he put in this ice cream machine and it took us

140
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.199
a while for us, you know, to get the twirl right and to do the half and half and all that kind of

141
00:32:52.209 --> 00:32:58.520
stuff. But we also, you know, realized that at some point, you know, the milk, you know, was going

142
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.130
to go bad in the machine and you had to change it and that meant you had to clean the machine. If

143
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.859
you've ever had to clean the ice cream machine, I want you to know that is the real reason why you

144
00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:16.670
cannot get ice cream at a fast food joint. Because if you have to clean that machine, it is a lot of

145
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.910
work. And so there I was, you know, just a young man holding up this heavy bucket as my father was

146
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.729
cleaning the machine and showing my brother and I how to do it. At some point. I don't know.

147
00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:38.189
Daydreaming, distracted the bucket was getting heavier. It just fell on top of me, covered me from

148
00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:48.520
head to toe, milk everywhere, everywhere. I mean, it was a disaster. It was an unwanted disaster.

149
00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:55.010
Now, keep in mind that now I don't have a change of clothes. I have no way to clean myself. I have

150
00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:01.339
no way how to, to, to, to just keep working and house our house at that time was in a whole other

151
00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:06.829
neighborhood. So there was no way for me to be able to continue there. Um, and so my dad had to go

152
00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:12.968
to Rockland, which wasn't too far and buy me clothes. Um, but then he realized it was too expensive.

153
00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:13.648
So he went back to

154
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.469
and, and, and was bargaining for a pair of jeans and a shirt just so that I could have, you know,

155
00:34:21.479 --> 00:34:30.330
something to wear and he actually had to hose me down outside the store and I was, I was like, so

156
00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.629
embarrassed. Can you imagine this being like, just covered from head to toe and ice cream and your

157
00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:42.529
dad's there with a hose and people are watching by and watching and and walking by and they're

158
00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:49.489
saying what is going on with this crazy Italian family in this store and then they come in and they

159
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:54.590
see that disaster everywhere. Well, I just want you to know that at some point you've all

160
00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:01.489
experienced unwanted disaster. And interestingly enough when people talk about disaster management,

161
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:08.879
they talk about it this way, they say that there's natural disasters, there's man made disasters,

162
00:35:09.229 --> 00:35:16.709
there's complex emergencies and then there's, of course, pandemic emergencies. And we all know about

163
00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:24.520
that and they say that it breaks it down even further into four categories. One is mitigation,

164
00:35:25.129 --> 00:35:34.169
preparedness response and then recovery and they basically have a plan under each of these for

165
00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:40.820
whatever the emergency may be. So whatever the situation is, this is what they end up looking at,

166
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:49.260
taking care of and, and doing. And so when I think about disaster management, I think about how bad,

167
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:56.300
you know, it was for the people of Israel to go through this in their own lives in the desert

168
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:02.699
experience. Now we've been talking about this getting there because they're leaving a fertile land

169
00:36:02.709 --> 00:36:09.439
called Egypt. And even though they were enslaved there, they often looked back on it with fondness

170
00:36:09.449 --> 00:36:14.919
because they had things there that they obviously didn't have in the desert. Now, they don't know

171
00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:21.959
what it is in Canaan yet because they haven't been there. So the only thing they have to compare to

172
00:36:21.989 --> 00:36:27.429
is the past, does that make sense? And when I think about what God has for me in the future,

173
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:36.229
it's too vague. It's, it's unclear to me when I think about the future, I think. Ok, yeah, it can be

174
00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:46.399
exciting but it could also be like, not. And so what I'm familiar with is the past and we tend to

175
00:36:46.409 --> 00:36:51.939
cling to the past as a result because it's what we know and what we want to go back to. And the

176
00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:59.209
people of Israel continuously talked about going back and always found that strange, like, why would

177
00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:04.149
you want to go back? Well, it's because it's what they know. You know, there's a scripture that

178
00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:11.530
talks about how we can get so comfortable in darkness that we can actually sit there and never want

179
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:19.840
to leave, that we can get so adjusted to being in the dark that it begins to feel like there's just

180
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:26.629
enough light for us to be able to survive there. And instead of wanting to leave the darkness, we

181
00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:32.909
just stay where we are. And when you're in a desert experience, you're in a transition. It means

182
00:37:32.919 --> 00:37:38.469
that what you've left for sure is better than where you are because where you are right now feels

183
00:37:38.479 --> 00:37:46.699
like every day, it's like another unwanted disaster. And when we're living life from one unwanted

184
00:37:46.709 --> 00:37:52.840
disaster to another, we're just always living in a crisis. And when we're always living in a crisis,

185
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:57.429
then we're always going to be complaining about that crisis. And when we're complaining about that

186
00:37:57.439 --> 00:38:04.750
crisis, we're also going to always feel like no one cares about us as we are in that crisis. We're

187
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:11.909
going to believe that God has zero to no concern about us because we're always in a crisis. Have you

188
00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:16.800
ever seen yourself just go from one crisis to the next to the next to the next and feel like they

189
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:23.810
were never going to end. You were living a season of unwanted disaster. And, and maybe that was

190
00:38:24.139 --> 00:38:29.679
because of a natural thing, maybe because it was a manmade thing. Maybe it was because of someone

191
00:38:29.689 --> 00:38:39.399
else's thing and maybe it was all your doing thing, but whatever it was, it didn't change the fact

192
00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:46.929
that when you look at something that was better, you sometimes just want to go back. And I remember

193
00:38:46.939 --> 00:38:53.719
doing that early on in my spiritual journey. I remember there were times when I felt like being a

194
00:38:53.729 --> 00:39:01.500
follower of Jesus was just too hard. It was just too complicated. It was just too many things that I

195
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:07.959
had to give up. And, and I've often thought about this phrase where people have often misinterpreted

196
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:12.929
this and they talk about it like, like it's just something that you have to carry. It's something

197
00:39:12.939 --> 00:39:19.250
that's a burden you have to bear and they say, you know, take up your cross and, and, and follow

198
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:31.250
Jesus. And we often think that that cross is just a burden but that's not what that means. Taking up

199
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.409
your cross means dying to the old things.

200
00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:47.850
It's not about carrying a burden, it's about dying to the old life. So when Jesus says, I want you

201
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:53.530
to take up your cross and follow me. He's saying I want you to die to the old life

202
00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:02.629
and unless you're willing to die to the old life and then, then your life is going to be one burden

203
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:12.649
after another, after another one disaster after another, after another, that you were not able to

204
00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:22.139
break the cycle of. And so I want you to take up your cross and follow me. And we looked at this

205
00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:28.479
briefly in another story, when the waters at marrow were bitter. Moses had to throw in a piece of

206
00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:36.000
wood to make it sweet. And then the wood was a symbol of the cross that would one day come and take

207
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:41.479
all that was bitter and make it sweet again. And I want you to imagine that there are things in our

208
00:40:41.489 --> 00:40:48.419
life that are unwanted and what God does in the transitions of our life is that He is training us.

209
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.629
And so when we are in a transition, we're being trained. And the reason he's training us is because

210
00:40:56.639 --> 00:41:02.989
he wants to lead you to a place of transformation. Now, if, if you don't accept the transition that

211
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.719
you're in, then you're going to rebel against any form of training that comes your way you're not

212
00:41:09.729 --> 00:41:14.030
going to see it as training, what you're going to see it as is just disaster.

213
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:24.300
You're just going to look at it and you're going to say this is just God disciplining me and you're

214
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.030
not going to take that as training. You're just going to take that as a rebuke and instead of it

215
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.949
bringing you closer to God, it's going to push you further from him. And so when I'm experiencing

216
00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:42.870
disaster, I have to sometimes wonder God, is this just like something natural? Is this something

217
00:41:42.969 --> 00:41:48.949
unnatural? Is this something coming at me spiritual or is this something because of my own doing? I

218
00:41:48.959 --> 00:41:56.899
have to analyze that. I have to look at that. Is this Satan just making my life hard? Or is this me

219
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:03.899
and my choices bringing disaster into my life? And what the people of Israel didn't recognize is

220
00:42:03.909 --> 00:42:11.110
that they were constantly being faced with this reality of yes, they were being tested in the desert,

221
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:18.790
but they were also being trained and then they didn't accept the training. They didn't want that

222
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.389
training. And so they were making demands. And the Bible says that when you are in a crisis, you're

223
00:42:26.399 --> 00:42:33.250
going to begin to complain and when you complain, it's because you're not accepting the situation

224
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:40.600
that you're in. And therefore, I wonder if I'm complaining, Lord, is it because I'm rebelling

225
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:48.510
against the training and the transition that I'm in? Am I railing against you? Because I don't like

226
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:56.800
the way you're trying to bring about transformation or is it that I am actually lustfully greedy and

227
00:42:56.810 --> 00:43:10.580
filled with gratitude and so making demands we're gonna see in this story always brings discipline

228
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.909
and it's something that I struggle with because I look at the scriptures and I say I have a God who

229
00:43:18.919 --> 00:43:25.629
is a great God who has given me incredible promises that I can rely on and go to and depend on and,

230
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:33.919
and I can utilize to see my life changed and transformed by. And so when is it that I'm making a

231
00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:41.469
demand of the Lord? And when is it that I'm just exercising my faith of the Lord? You see when I

232
00:43:41.479 --> 00:43:50.909
make a demand of the Lord, I think I'm going beyond what God has prescribed beyond what he has

233
00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:58.969
allowed beyond what he has said beyond what he is putting me through that he wants me to live

234
00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:02.050
through. And I'm just trying to get out from under.

235
00:44:04.189 --> 00:44:12.149
And so in numbers 11, let's take a look at these verses in verse 31 to 34 we're going to see that

236
00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:18.760
out of their complaint for always eating the same thing. They were always eating manna that they

237
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:25.280
decided that they were going to complain against God and they were going to demand me. And so God

238
00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:35.290
affects the migration of birds and he has these birds diverted into the desert and he allows them by

239
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:45.709
the hundreds, possibly hundreds of thousands to accumulate in the desert. He gave them so much meat

240
00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:49.409
that they became disgusted with how much they had.

241
00:44:51.770 --> 00:45:00.590
They had complained so much that God gave them more than what they had even asked for in, in the

242
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:07.000
scriptures. It describes it as being somewhere around 3 ft deep of birds.

243
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:18.540
And so the people went out and what did they do? They caught quail all that day in verse 32 and

244
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:25.280
throughout the next day and all the next day too and look at this, no one gathered less than 50

245
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:32.699
bushels and they spread the quail out around the camp for it to dry. But while they were gorging

246
00:45:32.709 --> 00:45:39.030
themselves on the meat and while it was still in the mouths of those who had complained, look at

247
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:46.189
this, the anger of the Lord blazed against the people. He saw them gorging in their greed. Do you

248
00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:55.530
you understand what's happening in the story? And the place was called Kibroth-hattaavah because in that moment,

249
00:45:55.540 --> 00:46:06.250
he struck him with a severe plague which means look at this graves of gluttony because they buried

250
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:14.389
the people - look at this - who craved meat from Egypt. So not everybody died, but some did.

251
00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:25.530
And the Bible says that the ones who died were the ones who were the greediest.

252
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.899
The ones who were gorging themselves,

253
00:46:33.939 --> 00:46:42.699
that the level of gluttony that they were living went against everything that God had prescribed for

254
00:46:42.709 --> 00:46:52.270
them. And so I look for wisdom in the scriptures and, and, and Proverbs often provides it. And

255
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:59.790
Proverbs chapter 22 verse three tells us this. It says that a prudent person is going to foresee

256
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.770
danger. Remember we talked about disaster management

257
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.310
and what are they going to do? They're going to take precautions. Remember that the first rule was

258
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.149
mitigation.

259
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:16.090
It means you're going to calculate, you're going to evaluate, you're going to, you're going to

260
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:21.469
prepare and you're going to be ready for what comes next because you're going to want to recover.

261
00:47:23.219 --> 00:47:30.419
But it says that the simple minded person, the simpleton goes blindly on and does what and just

262
00:47:30.429 --> 00:47:31.639
suffers the consequences.

263
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:41.669
And so God is saying, I know that you're all wanting to avert and avoid disaster, but there's going

264
00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:49.030
to be a way for you to accomplish that. You see avoiding unwanted disasters is going to be

265
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:55.959
understood through what Proverbs says. It says that we need to be prudent. It, it means that we're

266
00:47:55.969 --> 00:48:02.449
gonna have to foresee danger. It means that we're gonna have to take precaution and not be like the

267
00:48:02.459 --> 00:48:09.020
simple minded person who just suffers the consequences because all they do is gorge themselves

268
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:15.949
through their greed on. What is there. God says, I don't want you to be this type of person. And so

269
00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:22.120
when we come into the presence of God and we come with our requests, here's why it is always good.

270
00:48:22.879 --> 00:48:32.459
It is always best. It is always preferable for us to come before God with praise before we go into

271
00:48:32.469 --> 00:48:40.250
prayer. Because if you get to the place where you are just thanking God for who he is and for what

272
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.729
He has already done for you in your life, you're going to see how your prayers will be transformed

273
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:53.360
and you're going to be reminded of your purpose and then you're gonna be able to recall and call

274
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:59.760
upon the promises of God. And then you're gonna be able to move from that place. And you're gonna be

275
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:07.300
able to say, Lord, I want to you more than anything else. And I know that my peace can only come

276
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:15.719
from you. I know that my protection can only come from you. I know that my prosperity can only be

277
00:49:15.729 --> 00:49:23.010
because of you. You see when you get to that place, it is because you went to a place of praise

278
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:31.479
before you just went to a place of prayer which can often just lead you into a place of complaint. I,

279
00:49:31.489 --> 00:49:38.300
I know it's easy for us to complain. I know it's easy for us to just go before God and whine and,

280
00:49:38.459 --> 00:49:43.929
and, and unburden ourselves and you know what God can take it. He's not shocked by any of that. He

281
00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:49.129
knows we've been whining forever. He knows that He knows that we're often unhappy. He knows that

282
00:49:49.139 --> 00:49:55.500
we're often complaining. He, he, he's not shocked and surprised by any of that. But what, what he is

283
00:49:55.510 --> 00:50:04.189
shocked by is our inability to take the next step in our faith journey. You see the reason we want

284
00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:11.050
to move away from being a whiner and a complainer to a person who is filled with faith and is filled

285
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:18.739
with praise is so that we can show God that we are making progress in the transition of life that

286
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:26.879
we're in, that He doesn't have to keep disciplining us that we don't have to keep reliving and

287
00:50:26.889 --> 00:50:36.010
living new disasters. But rather that we can make new discoveries of how great God is and how many

288
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:44.330
great things He can do for us. If we will just remain faithful and keep trusting Him and keep

289
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:49.629
believing in Him. He will always be our deliverer.

290
00:50:52.370 --> 00:51:01.669
We need God's wisdom, we needed to lead us away from danger and from disaster. That's what Proverbs

291
00:51:01.679 --> 00:51:08.010
tells us. It reminds us that this is what we're going to have to do. But God wants us also to

292
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:15.639
experience so much more and I don't know about you. But I know that even when I'm not asking for God

293
00:51:15.649 --> 00:51:24.000
to protect me, I, I live with the promise that He's protecting me, anybody else. And that doesn't

294
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:30.300
mean that I don't get injured. I rolled my ankle a few weeks ago and I've been in excruciating pain

295
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.350
for like about three weeks now and it just finally started to get better and it's one of those

296
00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:39.280
things that it just takes a long time to heal. Have you ever had that kind of an injury where it

297
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:44.030
just, it just lingers and every day you wake up and it hurts and every day you take a step and it

298
00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:49.280
hurts and every day when you're lying in bed, it's hurt, it's hurting you and it's keeping you awake

299
00:51:50.739 --> 00:51:57.459
and sometimes you wonder, Lord, but I was out serving you. I was, I was doing stuff for other people

300
00:51:57.469 --> 00:52:03.909
and I got injured. Why didn't you protect me? Do you think I, do? You think I ever said that? No, I

301
00:52:03.919 --> 00:52:05.270
never, I never even brought it up.

302
00:52:08.169 --> 00:52:15.580
It's a waste of time. II I know how this life works now. I know that I'm not protected from

303
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:24.020
everything, but I'm protected in a way that God takes any situation and uses it to train me,

304
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:29.790
discipline me, prepare me because no matter what the transition is in my life, if he's telling me to

305
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.939
slow down and to rest and I don't do it, then he's gonna cripple me

306
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.520
and I had to take an entire week off to get off my foot because it kept swelling up. It was twice

307
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:48.270
the size of the other one. I mean, feet are already ugly, but this foot was disgusting when it

308
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:53.260
swells up to twice the size. God was telling me, you just gotta have to rest and if you're not gonna

309
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.090
do it, I'm gonna show you how you're gonna do it.

310
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:03.750
And I, and I think that when we are being trained by God in the transitions of our life, it's all

311
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.810
about the transformation. He really wants to lead us to. It's, it's not the moment in which we're

312
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:14.689
being disciplined, but it's what that discipline means for the next moments to come. Do you see that

313
00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:22.489
sometimes? II, I discipline my Children in the moment that we're in, but it's not just for this

314
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:29.500
moment, it's for future moments. I, I don't discipline them for today for what they did, right or

315
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:35.350
wrong. II, I discipline them because I don't want them to be that kind of person in the future. I

316
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.770
want them to be better than me. I want them to do better than I ever did. I want them to, to be a

317
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:47.949
great human being. Not just a great follower of Jesus and, and I, and I, as I discipline my kids,

318
00:53:47.959 --> 00:53:52.790
I'm trying to teach them that these are the values that matter. This is the characteristics you need

319
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.649
to have. I don't want you to be this way because no one wants to be around a person who's like this

320
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:04.389
and you're going to have more problems in your life if you continue on this path and I want you to

321
00:54:04.399 --> 00:54:09.800
break free from this because if you don't, then you're not going to be able to have and be

322
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:15.080
everything that God wants you to be. And so if I can understand these things when I'm training and

323
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:21.570
teaching my Children to help them lead to a place of transformation. How much better is God at this

324
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:30.360
for all of us? Are, are we gonna trust God for that? Are we going to just understand that He's doing

325
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:38.510
this for us? You see when the meat arrived? So did the plague, did you get that?

326
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:46.830
See God gives you what you want. You have that free will you want this? I'm gonna give it to you.

327
00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:54.580
You want it so much, I'm gonna give you so much of it. You can gorge on it but with it, but with it

328
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:55.760
comes a plague

329
00:54:58.429 --> 00:55:03.699
and so we've got to be careful what we ask for. Does that make sense? You see, they were asking for

330
00:55:03.709 --> 00:55:11.500
me, God gave them so much meat that with it came disease, they gorged on it so much that they

331
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:16.729
actually got sick from it and they had to be buried in the desert because of it.

332
00:55:18.889 --> 00:55:28.159
And they named those graves, greedy graves, graves of gluttony. Can you imagine?

333
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:38.899
That's what they were remembered for in numbers 11, in verse 18 to verse 20. Look at what it says in

334
00:55:38.909 --> 00:55:39.669
this passage,

335
00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:50.189
it says and say to the people purify yourselves for tomorrow, you're going to have meat to eat. So I

336
00:55:50.199 --> 00:55:54.129
think that there are some people who did it and he lived

337
00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:05.469
and then there were some who didn't and they died. You see, God gave him a warning to purify

338
00:56:05.479 --> 00:56:06.860
themselves being and get right.

339
00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:17.419
The spirit of complaint. I want it to be gone from your heart. But there were those whose hearts had

340
00:56:17.429 --> 00:56:18.409
already been hardened.

341
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:28.000
And so when it came to eat the meat, some lived and others died, does that make sense? This is the

342
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:35.620
answer here in this passage. And he says, you were whining and the Lord heard you when you cried oh

343
00:56:35.629 --> 00:56:44.270
for some meat, we were better off in Egypt. And God says, you keep yearning for the past, you keep

344
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:53.320
doing that, you keep looking back. And so I'm gonna give it for you to eat. And so for anyone who

345
00:56:53.330 --> 00:57:00.439
then didn't cleanse themselves of that and say, Lord, forgive me, forgive me for whining, for

346
00:57:00.449 --> 00:57:07.729
complaining, forgive me for not trusting, not believing, forgive me, for not allowing you to train

347
00:57:07.739 --> 00:57:15.320
me or transform me, forgive me for yearning for the past and for a place of slavery, forgive me, for

348
00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:22.560
not trusting you. You said that tomorrow you're going to give me meat. I am going to believe in that.

349
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:28.280
And I ask you to forgive me and my household for the way that we have behaved. And those who ate the

350
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:34.729
meat, having done those things lived, but those whose hearts had been hardened,

351
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.729
they're the ones who died. And so God says, look, I get it when you're complaining when you're

352
00:57:41.739 --> 00:57:46.850
whining. I get it when your heart gets hard. I get it when you're angry with me. I get it. I

353
00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:51.929
understand it. But there has to come a time where you have to confess this where you have to repent

354
00:57:51.939 --> 00:57:55.989
of it, where you're going to have to turn away from it and where you're going to have to allow me to

355
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.550
do a new work in you.

356
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:08.540
And so the passage reminds us as we're reading it that now the Lord, sorry, if you could just go

357
00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:14.800
back back to verse 18, now the Lord will give you the meat and you will have to eat it. Now we can

358
00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:24.320
switch and it won't be for just a day or two or for five or 10 or even 20 you will eat it for a

359
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:33.290
whole month. Look at this until you gag and are sick of it because you have rejected the Lord who is

360
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:41.280
here among you and you have whined to him saying, why did we ever leave Egypt? And so God says, I'm

361
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:47.080
gonna give you so much of what it is that you want that you're just gonna, you're gonna hate it.

362
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:55.070
You're going to despise it. And it's interesting because we can do that in relationships. You can

363
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.219
get everything from a person and then hate them.

364
00:59:03.469 --> 00:59:08.929
You can get everything as a reward and despise the rewarder.

365
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:16.810
You can have so much of a good thing that it can also become distasteful in your own mouth.

366
00:59:20.139 --> 00:59:26.010
You see, God teaches us discipline so that we can understand moderation so that we can understand

367
00:59:26.219 --> 00:59:32.510
that too much of anything is never going to be a good thing.

368
00:59:37.159 --> 00:59:44.300
And I don't know what you've been gorging on. I don't know what you've been greedy about. I don't

369
00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:45.979
know what you've been driven by,

370
00:59:48.179 --> 00:59:51.989
but I want to pray right now that in Jesus name, that chain will be broken

371
00:59:54.260 --> 01:00:00.290
and that you will no longer be enslaved to your Egypt. Because what God has in store for you is so

372
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.550
much better than what it is that you keep gorging on

373
01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:11.620
because you don't want to end up in a gluttonous greedy grave in the transition of your life.

374
01:00:14.479 --> 01:00:19.500
I don't want to be led by lustful greed and I don't want to be led by an ungrateful heart

375
01:00:21.669 --> 01:00:28.330
because that's when life becomes more painful than it needs to be. And God is trying to warn us of

376
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:35.260
that. That's why he's speaking to us about this in this passage because these individuals who were

377
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:42.350
being led by God and being led out. Well, they got locked into a pattern of complaining and

378
01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:49.159
demanding and I believe that this is why they weren't able to break that cycle. This is why things

379
01:00:49.169 --> 01:00:57.179
got worse and never got better. I want you to do just a quick, a quick evaluation and see if you are

380
01:00:57.189 --> 01:01:06.929
in a place where you are locked into a pattern of complaining and demanding. Is there anywhere in

381
01:01:06.939 --> 01:01:11.679
your life where this is happening? Because if it's happening, then here's what's going to happen,

382
01:01:11.689 --> 01:01:18.540
it's going to lead you into a place of ingratitude and then distrust just like the Israelites, their

383
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:25.560
hearts got hardened and they weren't able to repent. And as a result, they found themselves just

384
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:34.399
farther and farther from God. And so in Hebrews chapter three and in verse seven and eight, it says,

385
01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:44.030
this is why the Holy Spirit says today, when you hear his voice, don't harden your hearts as Israel

386
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:52.070
did when they rebelled and when they tested me in the wilderness, do you see that God is saying,

387
01:01:52.100 --> 01:02:00.870
don't do what they did. Don't let your hearts get hard. See in the transitions of life, our hearts

388
01:02:00.879 --> 01:02:06.620
can get hard. We can look to God and be angry. We can get whiny and complaining. We can get to the

389
01:02:06.629 --> 01:02:11.679
place where we just don't trust him anymore where we yearn for the things of the past because we

390
01:02:11.689 --> 01:02:16.419
can't believe that the things in the future could be any better than what we've already lived. We

391
01:02:16.429 --> 01:02:21.979
look at the moments that we're in and we're not allowing those things to train us and to prepare us

392
01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:29.840
for what's next. We're just complaining, allowing our hearts to go greedy and hardened and

393
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:37.209
distrustful, but we don't want to be like the Israelites in the story. You see when you get what you

394
01:02:37.219 --> 01:02:47.110
demand here's what happens. It comes spoiled. And God is saying I don't want that to be you. I'll

395
01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.860
give it to you, but you'll see that it will never be able to nourish you. It'll never be able to

396
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:58.550
sustain you. It'll never be able to move you from the place where you are to the place where you

397
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:05.850
need to be. Instead it's gonna come with consequences and that's going to be the discipline that I'm

398
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:14.219
trying to avoid having to give you. And that's why the meat came with the plague. And that's why

399
01:03:14.229 --> 01:03:23.100
some died and others didn't. Because what they did in that transition is even when they recognized

400
01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:29.270
that what they had done was wrong. They at least repented of it and they asked God to forgive them

401
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:37.070
and when God forgave them, he delivered them. And I want that to be us. I want that to be you in

402
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:46.620
Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 11, it makes it clear that no discipline is enjoyable while it's

403
01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:54.610
happening, it's painful. But then it says, but afterward, there will be a peaceful harvest of right

404
01:03:54.620 --> 01:04:01.830
living for those who are trained in this way. Can we say amen to that? See God's saying, I'm able to

405
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:10.280
train you in a manner in which it will bring blessing into your life. It's going to be painful for

406
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:17.620
the moment, but it's not going to be like that forever because His discipline is intended to prepare

407
01:04:17.629 --> 01:04:26.149
us. His discipline is there for us to face the challenges and the conflicts that lie in our future.

408
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:35.679
And God wants to deliver us from those things that are meant to hurt us. Are you ready for that in

409
01:04:35.689 --> 01:04:44.379
your own life? Are you ready to receive God's Word this way so that you can experience greater

410
01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:51.149
things? We're learning from their transition. We're learning from what they went through for the

411
01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:57.030
things that they did wrong so that we can do them right? And this is our chance to go before God and

412
01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.989
say God, I wanna do things right now. I wanna do them your way. I don't wanna do it the way that

413
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.080
I've done them in the past. I want to do them in the way that you have in store for us, the way that

414
01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:12.070
you have it in store for me right now. Are you ready to pray that prayer with me?

415
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:21.889
So father, I, I come before you as we all do and we ask that you would be merciful, that you would

416
01:05:21.899 --> 01:05:30.149
receive our prayer of confession and that you would look upon us as we declare. This moment is a

417
01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:36.949
moment of repentance. Lord, there may be things that we're aware of and other things that are just

418
01:05:36.959 --> 01:05:45.770
hidden to us. We may have every right and every justification to whine and complain. But Lord, when

419
01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:53.510
we do that, we're also showing you that we don't trust you that we don't believe that you can get us

420
01:05:53.520 --> 01:06:02.310
out of this place of transition. We're saying to you that we're not gonna let you train us. We're

421
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.810
saying to you that we're not gonna believe that this has value that this moment is about the

422
01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:15.459
transformation that we need to experience. And so I pray that today would be a new day for us, a new

423
01:06:15.469 --> 01:06:27.100
moment that we would not be demanding without understanding your discipline that today we would look

424
01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:34.239
at your correction and see it as something that is painful for the moment. But it's going to lead us

425
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:40.939
into greater blessings in the future. And Lord, you know our futures, you know what has been

426
01:06:40.949 --> 01:06:50.560
prepared for us. Lord, I wanna pray your peace, protection and prosperity over these people that it

427
01:06:50.570 --> 01:07:01.139
would come by your hand and by no one else's, you define that and you declare that you demonstrate

428
01:07:01.149 --> 01:07:09.510
that in their life so that they can give you all the glory and honor for it. You see what it is that

429
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:20.229
we're going through, but we're gonna trust you God to get us through it and to experience everything

430
01:07:20.649 --> 01:07:29.540
that your promise has in store for us. And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you,

431
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:36.520
receive that over yourselves and over your lives and thank you for your attention. And we're just

432
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:41.850
gonna take a moment to just wrap up this gathering and we're going to be dismissed after this song

433
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.939
and So once the song is, has ended, it's an opportunity for us to just to say hi to each other and

441
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:36.930
still living in Ontario. No, you're back. OK. I'm not gonna say I'm sad because that means I can see

442
01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:44.238
you every week now. So that's good. We'll talk and uh we're just so glad that you're here today and

443
01:08:44.249 --> 01:08:49.289
thank you for being a part of this and I want to just acknowledge um one more person and that's uh

444
01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:54.599
Cheryl Walker. Cheryl could you stand? So people don't know you. But Cheryl is the founder of Moana

445
01:08:54.858 --> 01:09:01.999
Villages and uh they're the organization that we support. Um in the Congo and the work that they do.

446
01:09:02.008 --> 01:09:10.100
Um, and we support them every month and, um, and they're, um, just her and Lambert are just

447
01:09:10.109 --> 01:09:15.899
two amazing people who have a beautiful family. And, uh, and we just love them so much. And so we're

448
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:20.020
just going to take a moment at the end of this gathering just to pray for Moana and just to pray for

449
01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:25.970
the work that they're doing and um and just pray that God will continue to support them financially

450
01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:33.470
and the needs that they have. Um And uh and if ever you want to make a donation uh to them, you can

451
01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:38.429
always do it through rivers edge. And so father, I wanna pray for Cheryl and Lambert and for Moana.

452
01:09:38.659 --> 01:09:43.568
And I wanna pray for the work that they've been doing in the Congo for so many years now, uh for the

453
01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:50.128
challenges that they face and overcome for the lives that they have rescued and restored and for the

454
01:09:50.139 --> 01:09:56.910
ones that you're still sending to them to do a work with as they work with babies and Children that

455
01:09:56.919 --> 01:10:03.459
have been left and abandoned and just don't have the resources to be cared for sometimes just by

456
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:08.770
their own families who would love to do it, but just don't have the means. Lord, we have been able

457
01:10:08.779 --> 01:10:15.229
to support them and to be a part of that. And as a church, lord, we uh take the givings that we

458
01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:21.870
receive and we in turn, give it to others like Cheryl and Lambert through Moana that are doing this

459
01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:28.979
work in the world as you work through them, you are alleviating suffering God, you are restoring

460
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:36.850
lives and you are creating new futures and we bless them and the work that they do. And we ask these

461
01:10:36.859 --> 01:10:42.740
things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank you for praying with me for them. You may not know them.

462
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:47.290
But if you'd like to know more, you can definitely uh talk to them about the work that they're doing

463
01:10:47.299 --> 01:10:52.549
there. It's an amazing work. And so let's uh sing this song together. Would you just stand with me

464
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:59.970
as we would open in a word of Thanksgiving right now and praise before the Lord, we have these words

465
01:10:59.979 --> 01:11:05.169
that can help us to express that and to sing that. And so when we don't have our own words, uh

466
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:13.299
worship songs, help us to give us the words. And so if you're not listening to worship music, you're,

467
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:19.759
you're not able to sometimes be thankful and praise and to change the atmosphere in which you're in

468
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:26.220
the mindset that you have in the moment. It can really help you to do that with worship music. And

469
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:31.859
so if you haven't done this before, it's available everywhere on every platform, you can just tap

470
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:38.569
into that, find the songs that do something for you speak to, you encourage you and you'll see that

471
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:44.100
it will make a difference as you serve the Lord. So God bless you. Let's sing this song together and

472
01:11:44.109 --> 01:11:51.029
- I look forward to hanging out with you at the end. Amen. - Yeah, thank you Pastor Zo. Really spoke to me

473
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:57.819
Guys, something breaks off of you when you worship, when you open your mouth and you sing. I can't

474
01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:03.080
do it for you. We can't do it for you. We're here to help lead that. But when you open your mouth,

475
01:12:03.089 --> 01:12:07.660
there's an anointing. There's a power that you are declaring. Even if you don't feel it yet, you're

476
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:11.870
declaring something. And we're gonna sing a song where you're declaring, you're a new creation.

477
01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:18.990
You're speaking that out. And you're saying, I'm a new creation. My new name is written in glory and

478
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.629
that's something that when it comes from your mouth, there's something that breaks off of you. A

479
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:29.060
heaviness lifts and something breaks in the spirit. So whatever, hold, whatever is holding you down.

480
01:12:29.069 --> 01:12:35.120
Like pastor said, praise is like a pass code. It's like a way to get to that place where the burden

481
01:12:35.129 --> 01:12:41.209
lifts and you're carrying his burden and his burden, his yoke is easy. His burden is light and

482
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:45.259
that's the burden he wants you to carry. So let's sing this together and just think about that.

483
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:51.100
Something is breaking off of you as you sing and you open your mouth. So let's, let's go.

484
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:05.779
Not

485
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.939
Yeah.

486
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.589
Glad you changed.

487
01:13:59.109 --> 01:13:59.399
Yeah.

488
01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:04.720
Cheese.

489
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:07.100
Yeah.

490
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.439
Me.

491
01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:26.310
Yeah.

492
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:23.549
The,

493
01:15:27.009 --> 01:15:27.029
yeah,

494
01:17:03.939 --> 01:17:09.890
you know who's mine? Jesus. Jesus. He is.

495
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:12.529
Come on.

496
01:17:15.299 --> 01:17:15.359
Ok.

497
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.220
Right.

498
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:35.000
You are dismissed. We have some snacks and juice in the back. Joy.
