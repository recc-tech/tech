00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.820
Mhm Yeah,

47
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.700
review

48
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.830
of you.

49
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.920
Thank you, jesus.

50
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:25.240
Thank you to the worship team for a lovely set. I have a couple of amount announcements to make the

51
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:30.780
first one is uh if you're feeling generous or you just want to help out our community, there are

52
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:38.060
four different ways that you can help us by giving, they're all up here on the board. You can either

53
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:45.640
in person, e transfer through tightly or by mail. I also want to invite you guys to join us to our

54
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.720
after party at the cafe over there in the corner right after church would be more than welcome to

55
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:58.620
chat with you guys and share refreshments and little snacks with you guys. So now I would invite all

56
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:04.980
the Children to head over to the annex for their sunday school and let's watch this short video

57
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:48.760
and now let's welcome Pastor Lorenzo onto the stage. Thank you guys.

58
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.650
Did you feel that something just happened that many of us take for granted another year is

59
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:15.140
officially in the past. A chapter is closed and now we look ahead to a new year. The mistakes

60
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:23.950
missteps and missed opportunities of the past. Give way to hope, excitement and joy for the new life,

61
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:31.970
God gives us pursuing christ with each new dawn through his grace. We get the chance to reset the

62
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:40.920
clock to forget what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead as we work. Play rest and

63
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:48.020
worship. We know his mercies are new every morning. Those who hope in the Lord will renew their

64
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:56.680
strength, arriving at next year's end through his faithfulness. So whatever we do this year, let's

65
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:04.760
give it to God seeking his will, trusting his plan and taking this opportunity to restart

66
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.830
Well, Happy New Year. Yeah. I don't know. It sounds like no one's excited. That's okay.

67
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:28.750
We have like whatever post holiday christmas, new years type of thing going on and it's, I don't

68
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:33.410
know january. I don't know how you feel about january, but to me, I think it's the month. I hate the

69
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:39.580
most anybody else just, it's, it's not, I don't, don't get excited about january. I just, I just

70
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:49.300
like, I just want to like move right into March. It's just skip skip as many as I can. Um, and, and

71
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:56.410
I think that it's just, it just comes on us like real quick, you know, and and that sense of what's

72
00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:02.240
what's coming next can can be quite disappointing. But before we start, I know that not everybody

73
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:09.300
has had an amazing holiday. Not everybody's had easy an easy go. Uh, maybe the last couple of weeks

74
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.920
have been really tough for different reasons and and in particular this morning, just want to take

75
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:22.600
the time. Um I just pray for, for Darren and he's in the hospital and uh and we want to pray for uh

76
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:29.000
Darren right now that he would get a good prognosis and and good treatment for for what he's going

77
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.300
through and Kathy's here here today with your family and I know how important it is for us to take

78
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:42.920
this moment together to pray for him. Would you guys join me? My father just want to pray for Darren,

79
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:51.420
gonna lift him up to you, We know God that you have already blessed him, You've already saved him,

80
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:57.250
you've already delivered him, you've given him the victory before and you can give it to him again.

81
00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:07.070
And even when we hear a bad report, even when we receive terrible news, even when the prognosis may

82
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:14.360
not look good Lord, we still have hope and faith and we can put our trust in you. We see what

83
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:23.220
happens when we pray together, when we believe together and we put our faith together in seeing

84
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:33.770
someone's life just be transformed and we pray for daring and his healing right now in jesus name

85
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:41.200
Amen. And if you guys can think of Darren and pray for him throughout the week and until we hear uh

86
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:46.650
great news, I pray that you would continue to just do that upholding Darren and Kathy and the family,

87
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:55.680
I want to kick off this january with this series that we're in called um Don't waste your past and I

88
00:32:55.690 --> 00:33:01.900
I'm a type of person who doesn't like to look back too often and doesn't like to dwell in the past.

89
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:10.770
I'd like to turn my pages quickly. Um I like to move forward as quickly as I can and I want to do

90
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:21.610
that intentionally. I want to move past the emotions that can sometimes hold me back or the patterns

91
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:30.140
of the past that have somehow repeated themselves often enough to make me feel like I am stuck. Like

92
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:36.230
I'm trapped, I don't know about you, but I know that as we start off this year, many of us are

93
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:43.780
thinking about what this year is gonna hold and I believe that at some point we can sometimes get

94
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:52.530
even a little jaded and we can get just a little bit discouraged about what the future can look like

95
00:33:52.540 --> 00:34:01.440
because we stop believing that things can be different. And I want you to be encouraged today that

96
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.900
in spite of how we may be feeling coming out of this holiday season and no matter how our experience

97
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:17.450
has been in the past, um I'm joining you in this challenge to make sure that this year is different,

98
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:25.160
that these moments are not the same as they have been in the past and and the way that we can do

99
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:33.910
that is by being different. All of us here in this place. I can think about what it means to be in a

100
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:40.460
relationship with God differently. Don't give up. Don't don't just resign yourself to the way things

101
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:49.520
are to the way things have been. But when we talk about setting goals or when we have dreams and

102
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:57.620
aspirations, some of us are all about that and we we we we write those things out, we look at them

103
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:05.730
often we adjust, we even break them down into smaller steps to even make them more achievable. And

104
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:13.750
then there's the rest of us who sometimes just kind of like lean more on on faith and maybe faith,

105
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:21.560
hoping things will just happen and and and then praying that that God will somehow just intervene in

106
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:30.870
our lives and not realize that there is this collaboration that needs to exist, that that we have to

107
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:38.370
work with God to see things change and and be different in our lives and today I want to speak to

108
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:46.710
you about how we can break patterns and then the passage that I want to use for that, it may may not

109
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:55.480
make sense as we read it, but there'll be a point in which you'll see that it that it does. And then

110
00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:05.790
in luke chapter 22 we'll start there at verse 56. It talks about a servant girl who noticed him in

111
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:15.030
the firelight and began staring at him and then finally, she said this man was one of jesus'

112
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:21.740
followers. And what's happening in this moment is that people who were for jesus are now against him

113
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:29.380
and anybody who was for him is now being picked out in the crowd so that they too would face a

114
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:40.020
similar judgment. And and so there's this sense now that Peter is in danger and Peter recognizes

115
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:48.930
this immediately and this triggers in him a response. The fact that he's in danger triggers a

116
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:58.700
response where he makes the decision to lie. And so Peter denies it and he says, woman, he said, I

117
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:04.840
don't even know him. And after a while someone else looked at him and said, you must be one of them.

118
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:13.300
And then he says, no man, I'm not. And then an hour later someone else insisted this must be one of

119
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:21.470
them because he is a galilean too. But Peter says, man, I don't know what you're talking about and

120
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:30.590
then immediately, while he was still speaking, he hears the rooster and at the moment that he hears

121
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:40.400
the rooster as jesus had been arrested, jesus is being brought through this courtyard and as he's

122
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:53.650
being brought through this courtyard, jesus in that moment connects with Peter and looks into his

123
00:37:53.650 --> 00:38:06.430
eyes and the bible says that suddenly in that moment jesus looks at Peter and it is in that moment

124
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:15.420
that the Lord's words then flashed through Peter's mind. And so there's this moment of awareness

125
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:28.050
that occurs. But it happens only when jesus gazes upon the eyes of Peter and connects with him. And

126
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:33.860
then before the Rooster Crows tomorrow morning, he's recalling this, You're going to deny me three

127
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:43.200
times that you even you me. And then Peter left the courtyard and it says that he weep bitterly, I

128
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:50.210
don't know about you, but there are some things from the past that just continually haunt us.

129
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:58.110
I don't know about you. It happens to me. There are things in my childhood and I remember one time I

130
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:06.590
I just felt like I needed to sort out a bunch of things in my life and and it was it was like there

131
00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:13.060
were things that kept happening. They were so triggering my responses. My behavior was always in

132
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:19.560
response to that trauma that I had experienced things that had happened in my childhood, things that

133
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.280
I recalled. And I looked at those memories and I didn't see the connection at first, but I began to

134
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.090
notice that the things that I remembered the most

135
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:40.530
would trigger the pattern and the cycle that I was in. There was a response that was going with each

136
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:47.550
one of those and I needed to understand how I was gonna break that pattern in my life. There's

137
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:57.690
something about our memories that are there that we can learn from, but they're also very things

138
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:10.570
that are putting us in a cycle and a pattern that we find ourselves just unable to break free from

139
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:18.830
and live life the way that God intended. And until we understand this, and until we see what's

140
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:25.180
happening, even in Peter's life, we're not going to understand how to undo it in our own, in the

141
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:33.590
moment that his eyes connected with Jesus. His first reaction isn't one of Oh yeah, Jesus looked at

142
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:47.360
me in that moment, we see that Peter is now traumatized even further from what has just happened and

143
00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:56.850
now he sees his place and his role in that like never before, and the only thing that he can do is

144
00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:06.540
escape to the moment by leaving jesus all together and making sure he's nowhere to be found from

145
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:16.170
that day onward, he decides to go back to his old life because he believes that that is the day that

146
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:26.190
he didn't just deny Jesus, it was the day that God Shirley had left him. And there's something about

147
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:36.220
us believing lies about what happens in our past that has an impact on our present, that prevents us

148
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:45.890
from living the future that God intended and in the story in which we're in, we can see that the

149
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:55.420
past is something that continues to haunt us. We have to ask ourselves, why, why does this keep

150
00:41:55.430 --> 00:42:05.820
coming up, why is this happening over and over again? Why is this continuously chasing me down in

151
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:16.610
areas of my life that I really don't want anything to do with anymore. And yet there it is and in

152
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:25.020
the time in which we see something repeatedly coming back to us, I want you to ask the question why

153
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:35.890
and then understand that the past is also about teaching us to look at repeated patterns and God

154
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:42.750
allows this so that we can see something that is reoccurring in our lives, pay attention to this, it

155
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:50.730
keeps coming up and it's for a reason, I want you to know what that reason is and the reason God

156
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:59.950
wants to reveal it to us is so that it stops haunting us, it stops coming up, it stops attacking us

157
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:09.670
in moments in which we are triggered and in moments in which we are reminded through events that are

158
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:17.570
not even remotely connected, but there it is and in those moments it prevents us from living life

159
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:24.090
the way that God intended and so what God is saying when things repeat is that there is an

160
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:33.520
unresolved issue here, there is a lesson that I'm insisting that you learn from and I want you to be

161
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.620
free from this. And interestingly enough, I often thought that the past is just, it's always the

162
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:48.370
devil, Just always, it's always satan, but in the story, in this story, it isn't satan is it? It's

163
00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:58.170
jesus, jesus is the one who's bringing up the memory to peter, it's not safe and it's jesus, there's

164
00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:05.110
a conversation that they had about who was going to be the greatest and and and peter made his case

165
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:10.440
and probably won the argument about how he was going to be the greatest of all the disciples and how

166
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:16.850
he would never deny jesus and how he would defend him to the very end. And now, even though he had

167
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:27.480
shown an action of proving that in the Garden of Gethsemane, now we see that he's ready to deny him

168
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:40.350
and the recall that happens is when the eyes of jesus and Peter meet and so what brings the

169
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:52.250
conversation back to Peter isn't satan, it's jesus, it's jesus telling Peter remember that time, and

170
00:44:52.250 --> 00:45:02.490
this is what you said, and this is also what I said, and jesus knows his future

171
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:17.270
and in the present, he reminds him of how he knew it by revealing his past. And so whenever we're

172
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:24.340
living this life as followers of jesus, it can get confusing, There are times when we are resisting

173
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.790
the past and we're rebuking it, we're running from it, we're resisting it, we're doing everything

174
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:35.070
that we can to avoid it and we believe that we have to do that because what God is all about the

175
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:40.010
present and he's all about the future, but what God is also telling us is that I don't want you to

176
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:45.580
waste your past and that there are things in your past that are going to be essential for your

177
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:51.520
future and and the things that you keep running from are the things that I actually want you to

178
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:58.350
learn from and I want you to use those very things to bring about the healing in your life, like

179
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:09.450
never before. And so what he reminds us is that the past trauma in our lives is often the originator

180
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:16.580
of the present addiction or habits that we're in. But one of the things that I learned from my own

181
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:31.230
childhood is that I saw a father who loved me but didn't know how to love my mother, the way that I

182
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.150
needed him to

183
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:42.050
and and the trauma of of being in a home where I had a father who violated my heart by violating my

184
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:51.440
mother's heart, revealed to me that there would be patterns that would then repeat in my own life

185
00:46:51.450 --> 00:47:02.100
from the trauma that I had experienced because of that. And we may find ourselves in a relationship

186
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:07.180
today and find ourselves reacting and responding

187
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:20.120
in a way that is indicative of the trauma that we experienced when we were growing up. In fact,

188
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:28.380
maybe the way that we lie and the reasons we lie, the reasons why we won't accept blame or the

189
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:35.740
reasons why we overeat or the reasons why we drink or the reasons why we take drugs or the reasons

190
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:45.550
why we always respond in a similar pattern after a difficult event in our lives all of these things

191
00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:59.550
are there to show us where these are repeating why they keep reoccurring why we keep reoffending and

192
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:10.220
why it is that we are not experiencing life the way that God intended for us. I look at the coping

193
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:21.280
methods that I have used in my own life. And I have realized that I have kept the coping method even

194
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.110
after the trauma was gone.

195
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:32.570
Now, I initially thought that my coping method went along with my trauma. But then I realized that

196
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:40.590
as I got older and then as I became more committed and faithful to God, that a lot of the things

197
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:46.860
that I had occurred in my childhood and my adolescence and things that I had learned as a young

198
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:53.780
adult, that all those things were still with me. And I thought to myself, well wait a second. God,

199
00:48:53.780 --> 00:49:01.860
you have healed me from the trauma. Why hasn't the habit gone with it? And I realized that there

200
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:11.630
were two separate things you see, we often imagine that when the trauma is dealt with and and fully

201
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:21.830
healed that the behavior that is negative will also go with it. But the behavior can can remain. It

202
00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:29.810
can persist and that even though we have properly dealt with the drama and the trauma that we've

203
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:40.090
we've gone through? Well, the habit, the coping mechanism that we used to deal with it. Well, that's

204
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:49.780
still there and we need help in breaking free of that. And so what happens is that in this story,

205
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:57.370
Peter doesn't just lie once, You'll see that he lies twice and that he lies three times. So his

206
00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:05.010
denials happened once through one person, and then happens again through another person, and then

207
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:11.830
three, it happens through a third person. It would it wouldn't have been as powerful, still

208
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:15.770
indicative but not as powerful if it had been the same person.

209
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:28.100
And so the fact that it's a different person reveals a pattern in Peter's life and it is something

210
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:37.130
that I think was was there beforehand and we know that it was there beforehand because before it

211
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:44.170
even happens before he gets even called out by, jesus, jesus warns him of this and he says, Peter,

212
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:56.500
satan came to me and he pointed out your very weakness and he asked that you would be sifted that

213
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:04.860
you would be torn down because of this weakness. And then jesus says but you know I have prayed for

214
00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:15.680
you that this wouldn't happen. And then Peter says don't worry about me, jesus, I'm good, I used to

215
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:24.010
be this dude but that's not me anymore than you, me. The new Peter, the one that you saved, the one

216
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:29.750
that you changed the one that you brought transformation in that Peter that Peter isn't that old,

217
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:35.930
Peter, it's it's this new Peter now and I'll do whatever it takes, I'll be with you to the very end.

218
00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:45.720
And then jesus has to tell him the truth that even before the crow the rooster would crow three, he

219
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:55.760
would deny him three times. I think about how the frequency speaks to where we are most weak.

220
00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:05.740
And I want you to to ask yourself where is it that I am frequently failing falling faltering. Where

221
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:12.820
is it that Satan seems to have a hold on me. And I want you to know that that God is pointing this

222
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:20.700
out through the very frequency of it. The fact that it happens three times to Peter is God getting

223
00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:26.750
his attention and saying Peter, you didn't just deny me once with the girl. That could happen. You

224
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:33.470
know it's a one off but then you were good, you bounce back and then you were faithful. No, Peter

225
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:38.300
you denied me a second time. It was a different person. And then the third time it was a different

226
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:44.630
person. It happened three times, Peter and it happened three times to show that there is a pattern

227
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:52.160
here. And I want you to think of what is the recurring pattern in your life and then what is the

228
00:52:52.160 --> 00:53:01.470
mechanism that you use to cope? What are you doing to then respond to that? And you have the two

229
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:07.880
things that God has been trying to get your attention about for the longest time. He's saying here

230
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:14.540
is the sin. Here is the problem in your life. Here is where you've been missing the mark and this is

231
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:22.020
how you've been covering it up. This is where you've been in denial. Not once, not twice, but three

232
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:27.600
times. And then this is how you deal with it again. It comes up and this is how you deal with it in

233
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:34.420
that situation. And in that situation over and over and over again. This is what keeps happening to

234
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:44.470
you. And so when we see this, we can sometimes say, well this is circumstantial. I mean, Peter was

235
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:49.910
in the most stressful moment of his life. Maybe if we were in the exact same position as Peter would

236
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:56.320
have done the same thing. If we thought our life was in danger and we had a fight or flight response

237
00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:02.610
in that moment, we would maybe make the decision that we were going to fly away. We were going to do

238
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:10.420
exactly what he did. We were going to deny, jesus. Who's that? If he's going down, I'm not gonna go

239
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:17.000
down with him. If he's gonna get crucified, I don't want to be up on the cross next to him. If he's

240
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.660
going to be killed for this, I don't want to be the next one. And so we can look at that and we can

241
00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:34.200
say, hey, every choice that we make, we are choosing. We are choosing. Can we put that up on the

242
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:43.520
screen? Every choice that we make? We are choosing. We are showing what we are choosing and what we

243
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:57.080
are denying is that coming. Okay. And so what are you choosing? And what are you denying? I know

244
00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:04.360
that in my own life when I think about what I'm choosing. I'm trying to make the choice for God and

245
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:13.050
for jesus, but I also see that what I'm denying is often just my choice.

246
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:26.440
It's not what I'm choosing, but it's what I'm denying and what I'm denying is what I unfortunately

247
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:36.200
I'm saying to those around me, this is my choice. And more importantly, I'm saying that to the Lord,

248
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:44.470
um you guys familiar with steve jobs, Steve Jobs is the founder of Apple and he's a guy who who died

249
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:52.350
and passed away in 2011. And it was something that stood out about seeing an interview with him um

250
00:55:52.360 --> 00:56:01.170
when they were doing this highlight of his life and they often do this talk of him and as one of our

251
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:09.380
great geniuses of our time in the tech industry. And he said this: that for the past 33 years

252
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:18.130
I've looked in the mirror every morning and I've asked myself if today were the last day of my life,

253
00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:26.280
what I want to do what I am about to do today and whenever the answer has been known for too many

254
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.800
days in a row, I know that I need to change something.

255
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:43.260
The thing about what steve jobs is saying is that any change can change your direction, any change

256
00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:50.040
that you make can change the direction of your life and he noticed that there was a pattern and and

257
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:56.920
and and seeing how he lived his life, but also how it made him feel and I think that many of us have

258
00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:04.300
just gotten accustomed to feeling this way, just accepted that this is the way that it is. We don't

259
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:12.530
need to be reminded today that as we enter into a new year, that that time is not infinite on this

260
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:20.130
earth, It is infinite with God, but not for us in our physical corporal form. And we know that we

261
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:28.100
have a time here, that we need to make the most of this life and God wants us to live that life to

262
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:33.290
the fullest. That's one of his promises. In john chapter 10 verse 10, he says, I have come so that

263
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:40.330
you would live life and live it to the fullest. It's a great promise that jesus has made. But here's

264
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:50.550
the problem that if we don't see where we are stuck and repeating the same patterns, then we are not

265
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:57.330
going to experience that fullness of life. And so if God was going to help us today, he would say, I

266
00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:05.280
want you to begin to make a change, a change in your direction. I want you to change Just one thing

267
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:11.490
in the story in which we're in, Peter doesn't get a chance to change anything. He just walks away

268
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:20.450
and he's bitterly crying. But what's beautiful about this is that is that this moment happens, Peter

269
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:31.510
crying happens because his eyes lock with the eyes of jesus and in jesus's wordless gaze of mercy

270
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:44.480
and grace, the cycle of sin is actually broken because when Peter leaves the presence of jesus, that

271
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:54.010
is the change that begins to take place in Peter's life. It is then that he is reminded of the words

272
00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:00.740
of jesus. It is then that the word of God speaks to him. It is then that the word of God breaks him

273
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:07.280
because it reminds him of the conversation that he had with jesus, the interaction and the promises

274
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:13.820
that were made and and how they had been broken. He looked at that moment and and it just broke him,

275
00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:22.560
but it did more than just break him. The gaze of jesus didn't just break Peter, he didn't see it yet.

276
00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:30.560
He hadn't experienced it yet. But it broke the cycle and the pattern of sin in his life because

277
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:37.770
after he had denied jesus three times the person that Peter thought he would continue to be is

278
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:46.470
exactly the reason why Jesus went to find him to show him that he was no longer that person that

279
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:54.790
that cycle had been broken. But for each pattern that had been repeated, Jesus had to ask Peter,

280
00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:05.430
Peter do you love me? And Peter had to say yes, you know that I do. And then each time he had to

281
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:11.930
remind him of his purpose, then he'd say then go and pastor my sheep.

282
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:26.490
And so he's told that he's loved and then he's pointed towards his purpose and right now many of us

283
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:34.360
are stuck where we are because we don't feel loved, we don't feel that God has loved us. We don't

284
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:42.570
feel that jesus is loving us, we don't feel like his love is in us, it is for us, we just feel like

285
01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:49.610
Peter felt in the courtyard, he just felt guilty, he felt ashamed, he felt like I'm the worst person

286
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:55.810
alive, How could I follow jesus when I'm this type of person? And so what happens in those moments

287
01:00:55.810 --> 01:01:04.270
is that we keep repeating the behavior and the cycle that keeps us in this pattern of Brokenness

288
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:10.370
instead of experiencing the freedom that comes from understanding that the reason why jesus locks

289
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:19.060
eyes with jesus, that with Peter is so that he can be free from the cycle, Jesus wants to lock eyes

290
01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:29.430
with you so that you can have the cycle broken in your own life. He wants to tell you what the

291
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:38.660
recurring pattern is, not to make you feel guilty not to make you run from him, but so that you can

292
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:48.560
be prepared for how he tells you that he loves you and he still has a great purpose for your life

293
01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:55.700
and that he has greater things in store for you the moment that we understand this, then we're going

294
01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:04.020
to understand that every challenging moment that we face is going to reveal what's hidden. And so

295
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.060
God is saying, I want to show you, Peter what's hidden in your life, You didn't see this when we

296
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:16.760
first had the conversation, but now you're going to see it. This is what was hidden. That when

297
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:23.560
things became hard, when things would become challenging, when it would come down to you giving up

298
01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.010
your life or trying to save it, you would do whatever it would take to preserve it. And instead of

299
01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:38.240
choosing me, you would choose yourself instead of saying that you were my disciple and admitting

300
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:45.490
that publicly, you would deny it and you think that you're so strong. But what I'm revealing to you

301
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:54.910
is exactly where you are weak so that this weakness can be taken away from you and you would never

302
01:02:54.910 --> 01:03:01.850
have to deal with it again, God is saying I want to take away that weakness, I want to take away

303
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:09.280
that Brokenness, I want to take away that pattern, I want to take that away from you, I want to

304
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:16.510
deliver you from it. And so what jesus does to Peter is what he's saying to each of us, I'm not

305
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:26.600
gonna allow failure to speak the last word in your life. That's why he goes after him. That's why he

306
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:37.550
goes to him saying, I don't want the failure of the courtyard to be how you live your life. And so

307
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:45.090
when I think of my past, have you had failures in your past, if you had moments like Peter's moment

308
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:57.200
in the courtyard, if you had moments where you have denied God and you've chosen to live far from

309
01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.780
him instead. If you've chosen to live and to stand for yourself, or you have chosen to live and

310
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:11.820
stand for jesus moments in your life where it was just easier to do what the crowd was doing instead

311
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:18.900
of standing apart from it. Well then you understand what happens to Peter and how important it is

312
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:25.500
that jesus goes after him and he goes to him because he doesn't want that failure in the courtyard

313
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:33.410
to be the only thing that he ever lives with and and remembers and keeps haunting him from his past

314
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:40.820
saying, I've got something better for you and I'm gonna show you what that is and here it is, I want

315
01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:46.390
you to know that I love you for every time you denied me, I still love you and for every time you

316
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:53.950
denied me, I still have a purpose for you and I'm gonna remind you of what that is and I think of my

317
01:04:53.950 --> 01:05:00.350
life and I think of yours and I think God, what is it that you want to see me doing this year? What

318
01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:06.370
are the patterns that need to be broken for me to do them? How is this year going to be different

319
01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:15.430
from every other year? Just so that this year can be a pivotable one. It can make all the

320
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:24.200
difference in my life and the lives of others and jesus said these words to Peter and I think

321
01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:27.300
they're important for us even today,

322
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:41.350
he told Peter, Peter follow me, I want you to follow me. Peter had gone back to his old life, he had

323
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:48.860
gone back to the fishing to the ships, that's where Jesus had to go and find him. And then the last

324
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:59.880
words that he says that Peter are follow me and I think of how I am going to see the gaze of jesus

325
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:10.390
is by following him even in my Brokenness and in my patterns that are repeating, even being haunted

326
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:16.890
from my trauma and my past and and seeing how I try to cope with that by doing things that are

327
01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:25.470
destructive things that keep me in bondage, that keep me from living a life that is free. I will

328
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:33.550
lock eyes with jesus, I will follow him so that he can speak into my life so that he can shine his

329
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:41.110
light so that he can show me what it is that I'm doing and how I can break that pattern and and

330
01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:48.180
we're gonna need help with that being in community, helps us with that understanding what God's word

331
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:56.850
can do, can help us with that. Taking moments where we are fasting and praying together, can help us

332
01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:04.190
to see things and understand things through the gaze of jesus that locks with our own eyes and opens

333
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:10.840
up the window of our soul and reveals what is hidden just like Jesus had to show Peter what was

334
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:17.910
hidden. I need you to understand that Jesus wants to show you what's hidden in your own life, not to

335
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:27.420
destroy you, but to give you the victory instead To love you to a place of health, to love you to a

336
01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:37.590
place of purpose, to love you to a place of victory, to love you. So that 2023 will be unlike any

337
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:47.040
other year in your life because you have allowed Jesus to break the pattern that has held you back

338
01:07:47.650 --> 01:08:00.820
until today, Jesus is ready to introduce to you right now what he needs to do. So that pattern can

339
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.980
be broken once and for all. Would you stand with me as we close in a word of prayer.

340
01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:17.760
I want to thank you father for this opportunity that you give us to to come before you and and to

341
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:25.120
examine the story of Peter and to make connections and correlations with our own life and you know

342
01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:31.410
what we've been through. You know the patterns that we are in the areas where we keep failing and

343
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:36.790
faltering and making the same mistakes over and over again. And you showed us that when we locked

344
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.470
eyes with you and learn a relationship with you while you can open up our heart and reveal what is

345
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:48.730
hidden, You can reveal that which is weeks. That you can become our strength. I pray that today Lord

346
01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:55.270
that you would not only reveal, but that you would also restore and what you did in Peter's life is

347
01:08:55.270 --> 01:09:01.700
you did both those things you revealed and you restored him. I pray that we would be restored today

348
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:08.050
as well. I pray God that you would show us how much you love us and what a great purpose that you

349
01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:13.930
have in store for us. That how you want our life to be different than the patterns that we have

350
01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:21.180
repeated over and over again. Today you are calling on us to follow you again. Not to deny that we

351
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:30.760
are followers of you, but to follow you and to follow you in the way that you have taught us in your

352
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:37.760
word. I pray God that you would be the living word in each of us and that you would give us the

353
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:43.620
victory that we need in the area where we need it the most and Lord, I pray for every person here

354
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:54.490
today. I pray for their dreams, their goals, their aspirations. I pray, Oh God for their hard to

355
01:09:54.490 --> 01:10:06.440
reveal that which is good and acceptable and perfect according to your will. I pray father that you

356
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:15.130
would guide them on this path in this life and that you would bless that path and that you would

357
01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:25.120
give them what they would need most to honor themselves, those around them and above all you that

358
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:37.810
they would not only live this life to serve themselves but to serve others And in so doing serving

359
01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:48.750
you all along. I pray father that you would help us to Reprioritize and to reorganize and to

360
01:10:48.760 --> 01:11:01.360
experience once again, what it means for each of us to live a life that is fully alive Lord, you are

361
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:11.300
here to give us an abundant life. And I pray that we would experience that as we see, you give us

362
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:20.980
the victory in breaking the patterns of the past in jesus name. We pray Amen. Amen. Thanks everybody.

363
01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:26.460
Could you just be seated for a moment? Thank you so much. Hey,

364
01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:37.080
I just wanted to uh talk to you about a very important announcement during the month of january and

365
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:44.180
february, but we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try to raise uh $15,000. Um and it's for our

366
01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:50.110
community fall community hall, it's a community hall fundraiser and what it is that you can see that

367
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:57.540
we've been renovating the church, we've had to divert money towards the roof and as a result we

368
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:04.380
weren't able to finish the basement. So the basement is uh it's been over. It's been about four

369
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:09.920
years now that we have not been able to use it at all. And that really has affected us, not only in

370
01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:17.860
terms of ministry, but it's also affected us in terms of um revenue, rental revenue. Uh the hall was

371
01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:24.920
something that we used a lot to rent out And we haven't been able to do that. And so as a result we

372
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:31.770
keep cutting back on our overall budget will give you an example. Um for example, in this past year,

373
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:40.730
I think we we had a shortfall of like um $20,000 in our overall budget. But it's okay because myself

374
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:45.760
and our board, we worked at reducing our expenses where we could and we reduced our expenses by

375
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:56.020
40,000. So we will never run a deficit. We will do whatever we can to always cut to make sure that

376
01:12:56.030 --> 01:13:00.420
the offerings that we receive are the offerings that we live on. You would do the exact same thing,

377
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:07.690
right? That money coming in is the money you have to do what you gotta do. Make sense? So we did the

378
01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:16.970
exact same thing. So we also take the donations that you give us and we take 10% of those donations.

379
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:28.840
And we give it out two organizations. So when we look at it We would have to take $20,000. We have

380
01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:35.620
it. But we would take that $20,000. And we would renovate the basement. But here's what would would

381
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:39.410
would would suffer the organizations that we support.

382
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:50.550
So what are we gonna do fix the basement and then not give the money to the organizations that we

383
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.350
are making a difference in this world. We can't do that. I can't do that. I don't think God would

384
01:13:55.350 --> 01:14:04.940
honor us if we did that. So do we do. We have the money to renovate the basement in a way. Yes. But

385
01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:11.230
we would have to cut off all the organizations that we support and we can't do that because they've

386
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:18.950
already experienced the last two years of covid with us and they need that money now more than ever.

387
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:27.090
And if we cut them off and they may not make it, they're gonna suffer. And so the only thing that we

388
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:31.270
decided to do was say this to you guys and and this is what has to happen

389
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:44.520
if you're willing to participate in it. If we can raise $15,000 over and above what we normally give,

390
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:54.110
Then we can fund all the organizations that were giving money to $20,000 that we're giving out. Plus

391
01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:03.510
we can renovate the basement, get it open and get the community kitchen going and get the rental

392
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:09.520
revenue that we need from that and then get back to a place where we're able to use that facility

393
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.740
for our youth or young adults are Children's industries and everything else because right now, the

394
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:21.270
only space that we have that's usable spaces here and everything down there. It's just as big as

395
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:28.230
this for the most part is completely unusable and there's just a little bit left that needs to be

396
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:37.320
done. This is just the first phase. We can't renovate the washrooms downstairs with that money but

397
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:45.010
it can get the space opened for $15,000. We can open up the space and then we can do the bathrooms

398
01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:52.160
another time. But if we can get just that small amount of money with a lot of people, we were a

399
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.900
large community of faith. We have 600 people who call this place home. And there's enough of us that

400
01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:05.310
we can all give a little that it can add up to the amount that we need. So whatever God puts on your

401
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:12.520
heart to do, I want you to designate it properly on the envelope because we don't know where that

402
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.300
money needs to go to. It's gonna go all into the general fund. So we don't want that when we do a

403
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:24.230
special offering like this on your envelope. If it's your regular offering, it's gonna go under

404
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:29.040
general. But then if you wanted to go to the community hall, you have to write community hall. Does

405
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:37.570
that make sense? And then you get a tax donation for that giving. So whatever that amount is, I

406
01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:44.020
don't know if you know this, but you get that money back from the government when you file your

407
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:51.890
taxes. Okay. So it's something that you need to understand about how donations also work. We give

408
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:58.260
you a tax receipt for everything that you give, you can use that and the government gives 50% of

409
01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:04.650
that back to you. So not only does it benefit us, but the government needs churches like us to do

410
01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:13.930
the work that we do. So it gives you a tax credit of 50% on the donation that you give. Okay, this

411
01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:23.170
is not a masterclass on giving, this is not even a good class. Very basic. But it gives you just

412
01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:29.190
enough information, I think, to help you take the next step. I've taken a lot of time about this

413
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:35.740
topic, but it's an important one. Um Yes,

414
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:50.810
you can put it in the notes. There's a spot where you can write it what it's for. Yeah. Yeah. So I

415
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:56.690
need transfer. You can put basement, you can put community hall, you can even put community kitchen

416
01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.920
because that's like one of the things that it gets most used for and what we're trying to do is

417
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:07.160
reopen it. You saw that we've been doing this once a month here upstairs. But you know this is a

418
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:12.120
ministry of program used to happen twice a week. We used to have our youth every friday. We used to

419
01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:18.610
have young adult events downstairs every twice a month. There's a lot of things that we used to do

420
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:26.280
that. We just can't do. Um Even our daycare used to the kids during the week, all the kids would

421
01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:31.120
would leave the daycare and come into the church and they would have the big basement to play in

422
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:35.400
because they don't have a big gym there. And when it was too cold to go outside, used to come and

423
01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:41.530
use the church. So it's it's over 3.5 years that the kids now are are stuck inside when it's really

424
01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:49.590
cold and they can't come to the church either. So it affects everything. Um, and so we have to

425
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:57.310
understand that this building is not a burden. It's a blessing. It's given us the opportunity to

426
01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:05.320
meet, to gather and to do things in and from, and it also blesses the community. Um, there are many

427
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:11.730
organizations who can't afford to rent a space that they used to come here and use that space for

428
01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:16.980
free because that's what we do. We give our building to organizations that are doing work in this

429
01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:24.790
community that also don't have the money. So I think I've covered everything in terms of what, of
