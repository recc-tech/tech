00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.989
Welcome to Rivers Edge. We're so glad that you're here with us. Would you stand as we would open in a

2
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.880
word of prayer? We've got an incredible gathering planned for you today as we continue with our series

3
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:12.679
Getting There. And today, we're gonna be focusing on a topic that I think is going to be incredibly

4
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:19.529
relatable to, for all of us. We're gonna be talking about how we sometimes struggle with just living

5
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.429
a life of satisfaction. We're always looking and searching for better. And this was definitely a

6
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.220
theme that was a reoccurring one for the people of Israel as they transitioned out of Egypt and into

7
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.250
the promise that God had given them. So I pray that today would be a day in which he could speak to

8
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.839
us about that and the songs that have been chosen today and selected by our team that they would be

9
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:49.440
an inspiration and, and they would have an ability to just speak into our lives in a way that we so

10
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:55.429
desperately need today. I know that we can't always share what, what's going on in our minds and

11
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.260
hearts. We can't always know even what it is that sometimes it just troubling us, but we just don't

12
00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:09.839
feel ourselves. Sometimes we're fully aware of what it is that is not right. We know exactly what it

13
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.809
is that we're facing and dealing with and, and sometimes that challenge can just be overwhelming

14
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:19.720
whatever the situation and the circumstance is that you're in and that you're facing that you're

15
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:29.480
living. Would you believe in a God who not only can deal with that issue, but who loves you? And

16
00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:38.890
once to give you his best, can you trust God that He is going to bring the breakthrough that you

17
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:46.380
need? Because he's going to fulfill His promises and His word towards your life that you don't have

18
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:54.590
to live in the Brokenness, but you can experience the breakthrough in instead, can we believe that

19
00:08:54.599 --> 00:09:00.479
together as you would pray? So father, I want to thank you for every person that is here. We may not

20
00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:07.289
have the mindset ready to come before you and worship you. But I pray God that that's exactly that

21
00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:13.960
which we would do right now. You see what it is that we need, what it is that we're going through,

22
00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:19.669
what it is that we have to offer you and what it is that we feel that we're just missing, that we

23
00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:30.200
are unable to just have that sense of we are living that full life that you promised. I pray that

24
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.520
today would be a day that we would honor you that we would bless you and a day in which you would

25
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:43.109
show us something new and powerful for each of us. And we ask these things in the name of Jesus Amen.

26
00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:49.349
I just want to remind you that uh kids, church is happening right now at 10 30. And so you want to

27
00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:54.599
go and check in your Children right now at the check-in to lead us right there at the back to lead.

28
00:09:54.609 --> 00:09:59.200
Do you want to give us a wave at the check in? And so kids, you want to make your way over there?

29
00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:06.150
It's gonna be a lot more fun for them as they get to do fun stuff that they don't get to do here. Um

30
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:12.419
And there's snacks as well. So if you want to go there, um the, the youth ministry always starts at

31
00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:17.700
10 a.m. And so if you are a youth or if you have any youth, it starts before the service actually

32
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:24.609
starts at 10 a.m. And that's a great uh thing for you guys to be a part of and um let's get ready

33
00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:28.469
now to worship. Let's do it together. Would you welcome the River's Edge worship team?

34
00:10:34.109 --> 00:10:39.969
Good morning. It's so nice to see everyone and we are so excited to worship with you. I just wanna

35
00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:48.159
start by reading a verse together and it's from John 15 verse four remain in me and I will remain in

36
00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:56.710
you. No branch can bear fruit by itself. It must remain in the vine. Neither, neither can you bear

37
00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:58.460
fruit unless you remain.

38
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:10.289
And this world is crazy at best. And in our search for better, it can steal our peace and joy. And I

39
00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:16.840
can't think of anything better than to remain in Jesus as we go through this. And I our prayer is

40
00:11:16.849 --> 00:11:23.450
just for us all to keep Jesus at the center of all that we do. Let's sing this together

97
00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:11.859
Thank you. Worship team. That was amazing. And uh in case he didn't know that, um that's Iris on the

98
00:32:11.869 --> 00:32:16.609
keys and uh this is our first Sunday leading. Would you give it up for Iris and leading the team?

99
00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:16.810
And

100
00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:27.260
I thought they did, uh phenomenal. Well, it's so good to have you with us today and um we're just

101
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.609
gonna share some quick announcements and then continue with our gathering as we're talking about a

102
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:37.099
very important topic. And that is um getting there and I believe that God is all about getting us to

103
00:32:37.109 --> 00:32:44.709
the place that he has promised us and he promises that the work that he begins in us is a work that

104
00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:50.890
he desires to finish. He wants to complete it. And if you understand God, he's going to keep his

105
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:56.579
promises to you. And so if there's an area of your life that feels unfinished or a place where you

106
00:32:56.589 --> 00:33:02.420
feel you haven't gotten there yet, then I believe that today, um we're just gonna hear from God

107
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:09.439
about that topic and I wanna just let everybody know today. This is the um youth pool party and it's

108
00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:17.040
happening right after uh the gathering at uh one of our leaders homes. And so we wanna be able to

109
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.760
give you that information. All you gotta do is just go to the info booth and if you are um a youth,

110
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:27.979
a youth parent or someone that's involved in the Youth Ministry. You can get that information and uh

111
00:33:27.989 --> 00:33:35.300
make your way. Um there after the gathering, we also have a cafe volunteer uh sign up today. And

112
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:41.880
over the next couple of weeks, our cafe team is uh looking for some new volunteers that can just

113
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:47.640
strengthen that team. We need two people on every week. And uh we're just looking for people who can

114
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:53.290
serve at the end of the gathering. There's some work that needs to be done in preparation. And um

115
00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:00.339
Richard who is our cafe leader can talk to you more about that. And so this Sunday and in the next

116
00:34:00.349 --> 00:34:05.520
few weeks, you can have an opportunity to just sign up at the cafe itself and just put your name

117
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:10.570
down. It's nothing complicated, nothing that you can't handle. And uh and so we're not looking for

118
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.439
professional baristas. We're just looking for people who can serve uh who have a heart to help and

119
00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:21.199
to also make it possible for us to experience community at the end of every gathering. So if that

120
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.610
sounds like you, then definitely help us and uh sign up for that. We also have the unlikely royalty

121
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:34.449
women's event, which is coming up on Saturday and it's gonna be at 3 p.m. This is the wrong slide.

122
00:34:34.459 --> 00:34:42.229
We need to delete this, like trash it, like get rid of it. We keep, we keep putting up the wrong one.

123
00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:47.179
I don't know, it's my fault. From the start, but now it's no longer my fault. It's uh

124
00:34:49.709 --> 00:34:55.939
it's three, it's at three o'clock. So there's a sign up sheet with the right information there. And

125
00:34:55.949 --> 00:35:02.179
so if you just want to go and get more info, you can just uh speak to Patricia, who's our uh girls,

126
00:35:02.189 --> 00:35:06.110
women's leader. Thank you. That's it. Look, here it is.

127
00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:15.330
We, we put our, our tech team and our visuals team under stress every Sunday. And so, um again,

128
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:21.129
thank you for, for getting the right one there. And so then see Patricia, uh and she'll give you

129
00:35:21.139 --> 00:35:25.929
more information on that event, but they're continuing this series which is unlikely royalty. It's,

130
00:35:25.939 --> 00:35:30.750
it's women in the Bible who shouldn't have a place in history, but they do and they're in the

131
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:36.939
genealogy of Jesus on top of that great stories and the next one is on rehab and you really don't

132
00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:41.120
wanna miss that. You don't wanna miss the food that's gonna be there. Apparently they've got a red

133
00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:46.870
theme which means that everything that they're gonna be serving is like the food is gonna be red. So,

134
00:35:46.879 --> 00:35:52.760
I don't know, but I'm just gonna show up and just make sure everything's ok. And then there's the

135
00:35:52.770 --> 00:36:00.070
guy's Saturday retreat and this started off as a camping trip, but there was a lot of guys with bad

136
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:08.139
backs and a fear of uh mosquitoes. No, that's not what happened. That's not what happened. I'm

137
00:36:08.149 --> 00:36:15.139
making everybody look bad. No, no, we just, we wanted to make sure that we just did this for the

138
00:36:15.149 --> 00:36:21.239
first one. We did it right. So from one until about nine pm, uh we're gonna be meeting at the church

139
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:27.070
and then just heading up and having an awesome time with a bunch of guys that are gonna be getting

140
00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.850
to know each other. Some of us for the very first time, but we're gonna be hearing from a speaker by

141
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:37.209
the name of Sean Van. Uh a great speaker that you don't want to miss. And it's gonna be um a lot of

142
00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:42.659
fun. There's uh the, the men's leaders are Paul and Alex and so you wanna just talk to them at the

143
00:36:42.669 --> 00:36:49.219
end. There's also a sign up sheet at the info point that we have and just put your name down if you

144
00:36:49.229 --> 00:36:55.709
need a lift especially um then let us know we can also give you the address if you want to meet us

145
00:36:55.719 --> 00:37:01.669
there. And so we can do both of those things and it's gonna be worship barbecue. There's gonna be ax

146
00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:09.520
throwing at the men's leaders. Apparently, no, we can't do that, but there's gonna be so much

147
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.179
happening on that day and we just want to encourage you guys to come out for that. So we've got four

148
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:18.229
ways that you guys can give. Um the Tithely app is awesome. People use it all the time. The Canada

149
00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:23.449
Helps. Our website. You can also send a need transfer and we get to keep 100% of your donation. If

150
00:37:23.459 --> 00:37:27.639
you need a receipt, when you use the apps, you automatically get one. But if you're giving at the

151
00:37:27.649 --> 00:37:32.399
POS machines here, you need to fill out an envelope, put your name down and um the amount and then

152
00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:39.270
put the receipt in and then you'll get a tax receipt and uh we're blessed in that our uh government

153
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.080
uh doesn't do a lot of things, right? But there's some things it does, right? And one of the things

154
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:48.040
that still does, right is that it gives us tax receipts for supporting charities like us. And so

155
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:54.290
you'll get 50% of that back. So it's a good bonus and a good help um for you and it helps us every

156
00:37:54.300 --> 00:38:00.250
week. We've got the after party at the end of the gathering. And so is we want to just encourage you

157
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.550
guys to get some cold drinks and just more importantly, to have community experience, what it means

158
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.020
to be a part of this community of faith. So we are now going to transition to the bumper. We're

159
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:14.020
gonna watch this for a couple of seconds and then we are going to continue with our service today.

160
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.570
Thank you.

161
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:04.669
You. But I'm the type of person when I walk into a store, I'll find the best thing there and walk

162
00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:09.879
out with that. I'm not worried about what may be in another store. I'm not worried about what may be

163
00:39:10.239 --> 00:39:14.550
in another place that I haven't maybe researched or thought about if this looks like the thing that

164
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.479
I like, the thing that I need, the thing that looks good on me or something that I can use and it

165
00:39:19.489 --> 00:39:25.610
seems to fit the circumstances. I'm just gonna go with it. And then I married someone who is not

166
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:33.909
like that. We have to visit every store. We have to make sure we do all the research. We have to

167
00:39:33.919 --> 00:39:42.320
make sure that we are not leaving any, any store unturned, like every store must be checked,

168
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:47.790
otherwise we cannot purchase it. And even then there's always this sense that maybe we're still

169
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:54.389
paying too much and that we need to wait for when there's a sale. And then she enters into

170
00:39:54.399 --> 00:40:03.260
conversations with the sales people trying to figure out when these items are gonna go on sale. And

171
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:09.620
then I have to wait and wait and then she's like turning her into her best before she can get this

172
00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:15.850
information. So this takes time. So if she has to go back three times to the same store until she

173
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:23.729
makes friends so that she can, this person will divulge the info, then we can then be assured. And

174
00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:29.689
then after all that has happened and it's still sitting in her house and whatever else, it's on her

175
00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:35.530
body, in her closet. She'll then say, I don't know if this is like the best one I could have got it.

176
00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:42.590
I don't know if this is the best price I think. I don't know. Maybe I did. I don't think I even

177
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:50.810
needed this after all that. Yeah. It's been tough being married to her, but that's not what this

178
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:57.070
message is about. Um, but if you have time, you know, pray, pray, pray for me.

179
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:07.820
There's this thing about always searching for better and, and some of us have like this intense,

180
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:15.590
intense sense of fomo fear of missing out like we just have a big time and when someone else is

181
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:24.459
somewhere else that we declined to be at, we, we still wanna know what's happening there. We wanna

182
00:41:24.469 --> 00:41:30.459
make sure that even though we didn't show up that they're not having a good time because we're

183
00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:37.530
missing out on being there. I don't know if you're the type of person who even has like a great

184
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:47.540
thing in your life, a great person with you doing life with you sacrificing for you. And yet you're

185
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:53.889
always searching for something better. I don't know what it is about us. But sometimes we, we look

186
00:41:53.899 --> 00:41:59.770
at the people that are in our lives and we just think there's got to be better than this. We have a

187
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:05.280
friend, a good friend, someone who's there for us. And we just, we pray, Lord send us a better

188
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:12.409
friend. We, we have someone to do life with who's supporting us, encouraging us putting up with our

189
00:42:12.419 --> 00:42:20.000
garbage. And then we say, Lord send me someone who can, I can do life with. Sometimes the person is

190
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:26.909
already with us. Sometimes they're not. But there's this thing that we may have, which is about

191
00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:32.939
always searching for something better. I think that the people of Israel had this big time. I mean,

192
00:42:32.949 --> 00:42:38.100
they had this problem and it was so evident in their lives that, that they just couldn't shake it.

193
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:43.979
They couldn't get rid of it. Even after 40 years, they couldn't get rid of it at the end of 40 years,

194
00:42:43.989 --> 00:42:48.810
none of them even made it into the promise line. It was only the generation that had been born in

195
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:53.479
the desert that got to go in. But the ones who actually got out of the slavery and were supposed to

196
00:42:53.489 --> 00:43:01.760
inherit the promise, they never saw it because they were always unsatisfied. And I, I know that in

197
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:08.659
this life we're gonna walk through it unsatisfied. This, this life is not meant to satisfy us. I, I

198
00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:14.719
it isn't it. We're supposed to be grateful for it. And we're supposed to find ways in which we can

199
00:43:14.729 --> 00:43:22.290
derive satisfaction from the simple pleasures of this life. But it isn't going to us the way that

200
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:30.310
God intended because we're in a fallen broken place and we're falling broken people and, and we're

201
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:37.929
trying to do life with other fallen broken people. And so we're never going to find ourselves fully

202
00:43:37.939 --> 00:43:48.719
satisfied and fully living out life the way that we might have imagined. So there's always going to

203
00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:56.300
be this yearning for more. And I think that yearning for more needs to be directed differently. And

204
00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:04.860
sometimes we just keep directing it to the things that we think are going to satisfy us and we keep

205
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:10.169
doing that and then we realize those, those things are not helping us. They're just actually making

206
00:44:10.179 --> 00:44:18.189
things worse. They're not making my life better and they're not making it more meaningful. They're

207
00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:25.479
not making it that it's more peaceful. I don't feel like I'm more grateful. What I am is someone who

208
00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:34.790
is now struggling just as much as I did before I began to pursue this and try to have as much of

209
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:42.639
this as possible thinking that it was going to satisfy me in numbers 11. There's this story where

210
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:53.419
Moses says, he, there are 600,000 people standing around me and you say, I'm gonna give them enough

211
00:44:53.429 --> 00:45:02.600
meat to eat for a month. And he says, if we killed all the flocks and herds, he says that would not

212
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:11.229
be enough. He says, if we cut all the fish in the sea, that would not be enough. But the Lord has to

213
00:45:11.239 --> 00:45:20.669
then speak to Moses and say these words. Do you think that I'm weak now? Will you see if I can do

214
00:45:21.489 --> 00:45:29.389
what I say? And so I just wanna stop there for a second because I think most of us in this room feel

215
00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:30.489
that God is weak.

216
00:45:33.139 --> 00:45:40.590
I, I know we may not say it, but I think we live it like that. I think we go around behaving like

217
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.199
God is weak like he cannot meet the need that we have.

218
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:53.899
And if this is my mindset, if this is the paradigm that God has to destroy so that I can experience

219
00:45:53.909 --> 00:45:59.300
a breakthrough, that I need Him to do it right now before we go any further. Because the first thing

220
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:04.530
I need to do is I need to confess that I think this way that I live this way that this is in my

221
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:13.129
heart that I, I actually believe that God can't do it because my need is so great. There's no way

222
00:46:13.139 --> 00:46:21.129
that he could possibly come through. And so Moses is having the same battle and it's shocking to me

223
00:46:21.139 --> 00:46:26.070
that it's Moses. I, I accept that it's the Israelites because we've heard them complain and we've

224
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.040
heard them do this over and over again. But I'm shocked that it's Moses Moses, you're the one that's

225
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:37.370
doubting God after everything that He's, that you've done. And you know what's amazing about this is

226
00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:49.540
that God in his life had to give Moses belief. But everyone in this room, we all have to have faith

227
00:46:49.870 --> 00:47:00.239
that God did what he did in moses' life. You see when you witness something you believe, but when

228
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:03.580
you're not there to witness it, that takes faith.

229
00:47:06.169 --> 00:47:15.169
And so when it's believing Moses believes, because God keeps showing him that he can do it. But now

230
00:47:15.179 --> 00:47:22.449
that it takes Moses to have faith, he doesn't have it. Do you see what's happening here? See, I'm

231
00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:28.330
the same way and I think you are too where God shows up in our lives. And then we believe because we

232
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:33.689
experience something, but when we have an experience and we can experience it because of our mindset.

233
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:39.699
And because we believe that God is just too weak, we just reveal that we don't have enough faith.

234
00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:47.570
And I don't want to be a person who walks around like, like Moses in the story thinking that I, I

235
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:55.500
just don't have the faith that it takes to experience the breakthrough that I need. And so Moses

236
00:47:55.510 --> 00:48:00.270
then goes out to the people and then he, he tells them what the Lord has said and he says, you know,

237
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.149
this is what God has said. He said he's going to give us the meat. And he says, I want you to gather

238
00:48:04.159 --> 00:48:09.459
the 70 elders. I want you to bring them together and then I want you to have them stand around the

239
00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:14.989
tent. And the tent is the, is the Tabernacle. It's the meeting place of God. And remember they're,

240
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.550
they're a nomadic society right now. They're all living in tents and the temple hasn't been built.

241
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:26.669
So they formed a tent as the place where God is. And what's interesting about the tent is that it's

242
00:48:26.679 --> 00:48:36.600
the center of the camp and all the tribes have to camp around them, the the Tabernacle and there has

243
00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:41.899
to be three tribes to the north and three tribes to the south and three tribes to the east and to

244
00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:49.469
the west. And what happens in the story is that they all have to be facing the tent at all times,

245
00:48:49.870 --> 00:49:01.189
they have to be looking towards the Tabernacle. And so when Moses performs this next announcement

246
00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:12.030
and and and miracle, he's making sure that all the people are facing the tent because it isn't gonna

247
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:19.620
happen by God's uh by moses' hand. It's only gonna happen by God's hand. And so then in verse 25 it

248
00:49:19.629 --> 00:49:25.770
says, the Lord came down in the cloud and he speaks to Moses and then I love this part. He took some

249
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:33.739
of the spirit that Moses had and that he gave it to the 70 leaders. And with the spirit in them,

250
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:40.540
they began to prophesy, but just at one time. And then there were two men that were named Eldad and

251
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:47.459
May dad, who were also listed as leaders and they did not go to the tent and they stayed in the camp.

252
00:49:47.469 --> 00:49:55.320
But the spirit was also given to them and they prophesized in the camp. And then a young man ran to

253
00:49:55.330 --> 00:50:01.320
Moses and said, dad and me dad are prophesying in the camp and then Joshua, who was the young man,

254
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:07.340
son of none said Moses my master, you have to stop them. Ever since he was a young boy, Joshua had

255
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:14.959
always been moses' assistant, but Moses in this moment responds in a way that's kind of unexpected.

256
00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:22.770
He says, are you jealous for me? Talking to Joshua? I wish all the Lord's people would prophesy and

257
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:29.060
I wish that the Lord would give his spirit to all of them, not just to the 70. And then Moses and

258
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:34.580
the leaders of Israel went back to the camp. And what's interesting is that in this story, they were

259
00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:38.780
always searching for more. And we know that the story is about them not having what they want, which

260
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:45.709
is in this case, meat and God has to change a migration of birds and he allows them to end up in

261
00:50:45.719 --> 00:50:51.479
this camp and then it's 3 ft deep. And we looked at this last week and, and even as some of them who

262
00:50:51.489 --> 00:50:58.600
had not prepared themselves were eating it, God gave them a disease and a plague and the people who

263
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:06.600
had not made themselves right before God before eating this meat, then those people died and they

264
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:13.149
buried them in what they called graves of gluttony. And so what the story reminds us is that it's

265
00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:20.719
possible for us to experience breakthroughs. But then because of our lust for greed and because of

266
00:51:20.729 --> 00:51:32.229
our gluttony that we can miss out even in God's provision, his blessing that even what we're gorging

267
00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:39.909
ourselves on isn't going to be enough to satisfy us. But the story that we just read says, but we

268
00:51:39.919 --> 00:51:46.510
could fill ourselves with something different. I want you to think about that for a second because

269
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.989
what is it that I need to be filled with if I'm not going to be filled with, with my hopes and

270
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.379
dreams, my aspirations, my goals and listen, I'm, I'm a guy who, who's a goal setter. I'm a person

271
00:51:56.389 --> 00:52:04.270
who reviews those all year round. I, I have uh a board of overseers and we talk about the goals that

272
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:11.139
we have for this community of faith. We oversee those goals and we make sure that we're on track

273
00:52:11.149 --> 00:52:16.750
that we're doing the things that we set out to do. And every month we review those things and make

274
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:23.010
sure that God is still telling us to do the same thing. Or maybe he wants us to pivot make a change,

275
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:29.610
go in a new direction just because we know that we can sometimes set out goals at the beginning of

276
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:36.370
the year that God clearly isn't in and maybe clearly the people aren't supporting and maybe clearly

277
00:52:36.379 --> 00:52:42.729
we made a mistake and we've got to be humble enough and we've got to be deliberate enough to be able

278
00:52:42.739 --> 00:52:49.550
to admit those things. Not every goal I set for myself is one that I need to pursue wholeheartedly,

279
00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:54.659
not everything I've written down is going to be done with the right motivation. It's not always

280
00:52:54.669 --> 00:53:00.209
going to be done with the right intention. I think it is. But then I can also come to the

281
00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:07.449
realization that maybe that wasn't the case. Has that ever happened to you? You had good intentions,

282
00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:10.310
but you didn't have the right motivation.

283
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:20.840
And what happens in the story is that God says there's a way for me to ensure that you don't get

284
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:27.040
lost along the way in your search for something better. I can take the spirit that was in Moses and

285
00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:32.120
I can put it in 70 other leaders. And what he's saying is that I can take that spirit and not just

286
00:53:32.129 --> 00:53:38.270
leave it in Moses, but I can put it in all of you. The scripture that I read at the beginning was

287
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:43.500
the story of Jesus talking to his disciples about what it looks like to remain in Him just like he

288
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:51.449
remains in us. And when we remain in Him, like he's remaining in us, it produces fruit. There is

289
00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:58.550
evidence of that. And what God is saying is that Jesus, when he left, he was able to blow air on his

290
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:04.370
disciples and say, receive my spirit because he wasn't going to leave them empty. The same spirit

291
00:54:04.379 --> 00:54:12.000
that was given to those elders is the spirit that Jesus has ensured has been given to us. He remains

292
00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:20.429
in us. His presence is with us. And now you can prophesy. Now, when we think of prophesying, I, I

293
00:54:20.439 --> 00:54:27.010
think that we need to understand that prophesying is about declaring that and seeing that, which has

294
00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.330
yet to come.

295
00:54:30.739 --> 00:54:36.580
And when we're thinking about searching, when we're thinking about seeing our life in the future, I

296
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:41.340
know there's people here who have a, who have a one year plan, a three year plan, a five year plan.

297
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:47.659
Some of you have mapped out your whole lives. You, you're in a career setting right now. Maybe some

298
00:54:47.669 --> 00:54:53.229
of you are still in the educational setting. Some of you are in a job to pay the bills, but you've

299
00:54:53.239 --> 00:54:59.870
got another vision for your life. You're in a place, but that's not where you want to be. You want

300
00:54:59.879 --> 00:55:06.070
to be someplace else. I want to tell you this, that when the spirit of God comes in, you, you can

301
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:13.500
prophesy, not just over others, you can prophesy over your own life and your own future. You can see

302
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:19.719
things with clarity that you otherwise would not have. You would be able to declare over your own

303
00:55:19.729 --> 00:55:26.199
life, what God has promised. And what happens when you live that way is that you finally start to

304
00:55:26.209 --> 00:55:32.550
live a life of purpose. And it doesn't matter if you're in a transition, it doesn't matter if you're

305
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.189
in a season of your life where it's a desert. It doesn't matter if it hasn't rained. It doesn't

306
00:55:37.199 --> 00:55:44.260
matter if you're always eating the same thing. You know, because of the spirit of God that is in you,

307
00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:51.169
that you have a prophecy for the future that is greater than anything that you are living right now.

308
00:55:53.239 --> 00:55:58.530
And God wants to give that to you, doesn't want to hold back on you. He wants to bring people into

309
00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:04.760
your life who can also do that for you, bring you confirmation. And then all those things have got

310
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:10.969
lined up with scripture because that's the standard, that's the authority of God's word that has to

311
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:20.760
be through which we understand all things and can trust all things in numbers 11.

312
00:56:23.729 --> 00:56:27.530
The question comes up, what are we going to fill ourselves with

313
00:56:30.189 --> 00:56:33.739
now? They wanted me, but God wanted to give him the spirit.

314
00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:41.370
You see, they, they wanted something for their flesh. But what God wanted to give them something for

315
00:56:41.379 --> 00:56:41.939
their future,

316
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.310
they wanted something that was going to satisfy their lust and their gluttony. But what God wanted

317
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.370
to do was give them something that was going to give them so much more. It was going to fulfill

318
00:56:54.379 --> 00:56:59.310
every promise, every dream, every imagination, every thought of what an amazing life would be like.

319
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.709
He says, I'm gonna give you that instead. And so I'm gonna give you what you need. You guys are

320
00:57:03.719 --> 00:57:09.750
craving me, but what you should be craving is my spirit. And I just wanna give you a glimpse of what

321
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.250
that looks like. And so he takes a little bit, just a little bit out of Moses. I don't know how

322
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:19.530
Moses felt about that, but he seems, he seems ok and he doesn't seem to be weakened by it. He seems

323
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:24.419
to be fine with it and a little bit of that was in Moses now it gets distributed. It gets given out

324
00:57:24.429 --> 00:57:31.280
to other people. And to me that tells me that that God doesn't just have a Moses, but he's got

325
00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:35.530
leaders and he's got leaders in this room to whom he wants to give his spirit. Are you one of those

326
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:41.590
leaders this morning? Are you one of those people that he can give that spirit to? So you can go out

327
00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:45.989
and prophesy that you can be filled with the spirit instead of gorging yourself on meat, that's

328
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:53.399
gonna make you sick. It's gonna lead you to a grave that is named the grave of gluttony. I don't

329
00:57:53.409 --> 00:58:01.010
want that for you. And God doesn't want that for you either. And the Bible says in verse 3 33 that

330
00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:07.459
they were gorging themselves on the meat and even while it was still in their mouths, the anger of

331
00:58:07.469 --> 00:58:11.489
the Lord just blazed against the people. It's because they, they, they, they chose the lesser thing.

332
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:16.729
They, they chose the thing that they didn't need instead of the thing that they should have had, you

333
00:58:16.739 --> 00:58:23.429
know, sometimes III I see bad things happen in my life and it's not because God isn't with me. It's

334
00:58:23.439 --> 00:58:25.649
because I don't have his spirit in me.

335
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:34.050
See, see God was in the camp, God was with them. They were all facing the tent. But the problem was

336
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:39.979
even when you're facing the tent and God is in your midst, if you don't have his spirit, what you're

337
00:58:39.989 --> 00:58:45.610
gonna do is you're gonna end up gorging on meat that brings disease and even while it's still in

338
00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:50.669
your mouth, it's going to be killing you when all along, what God just wanted to do was fill you so

339
00:58:50.679 --> 00:58:54.629
that you could prophesy over your own life and your own future and give you the promises that He

340
00:58:54.639 --> 00:58:55.350
said He would,

341
00:58:58.159 --> 00:59:04.429
man. I, I just don't want that to be us. I just don't want that to be you. And the Bible says that

342
00:59:04.439 --> 00:59:10.639
we're in a place where we are never satisfied. We're in a place where we're gonna end up uh in

343
00:59:10.649 --> 00:59:20.469
graves of gluttony because we are people that just don't have enough of a spirit. And so he wants to

344
00:59:20.479 --> 00:59:27.409
pour that spirit over your life. He wants to pour that into your life and the people in this desert

345
00:59:27.419 --> 00:59:34.850
experience, they just keep choosing what God couldn't satisfied. And so Proverbs 30 look at this

346
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:47.540
verse, it says this in verse 15 to um in 16, it says there are greed has two daughters and they're

347
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:58.370
named give and give. And there are three things that are never satisfied really for that. Never say

348
00:59:59.149 --> 00:59:59.919
I've had enough.

349
01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.229
And then he goes on to list them the cemetery

350
01:00:07.889 --> 01:00:15.989
and the childless mother means the barren mo womb. It means a woman who wants to have a child. But

351
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.360
can't,

352
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:27.649
the land never gets enough rain. The land just keeps soaking it up and fire.

353
01:00:29.979 --> 01:00:37.699
That never says I've had enough. Now, now, the reason it's written this way is because God wants us

354
01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:42.110
to pay attention. So he says, there's, there's three things I want to tell you. And then he says, no,

355
01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.149
there's actually four

356
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:54.870
and it's like pay attention to how there are things in this life that are never satisfied. And he's

357
01:00:54.879 --> 01:01:02.080
saying, can you maybe identify with one of these things? And in the story that we read, some of them

358
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:07.159
ended up in the grave, some of them ended up dying, right? They, they ended up in the cemetery

359
01:01:07.969 --> 01:01:13.719
because they were never satisfied. They're in the desert. And so when you're in the desert, you can

360
01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:17.959
never get enough water. In fact, they were always clamoring for water.

361
01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:26.199
And we know that the people of Israel are a people who put their faith in God that even when their

362
01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:36.739
wombs could not bear Children, they did. So we saw that in the story of Abraham and Hannah and even

363
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:46.159
later on in Zachariah and Elizabeth, these were stories in which a barren womb was able to produce.

364
01:01:47.459 --> 01:01:55.080
And then there's the fire. And it's interesting because what God was doing in the desert with his

365
01:01:55.090 --> 01:02:04.449
people is that he was by day, they were following a cloud and then at night, he was leading them by

366
01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:10.010
fire. And there were moments in which it was safer for them to travel by day. And there were moments

367
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:14.610
in which it was safer for them to travel by night. And God was the one who determined the itinerary.

368
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:21.010
And he's the one who determined when it was time to move. And when God moved, the people moved, when

369
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:27.219
the cloud moved, they started to break camp and they would follow the cloud. And when the fire moved,

370
01:02:27.379 --> 01:02:34.929
then the people would follow the fire. And, and God is saying that he is also described in the

371
01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:44.169
scriptures as a consuming fire. But but his purpose to consume is to get rid of all that, which is

372
01:02:44.179 --> 01:02:53.370
impure. It is is to get rid of all those things that are garbage and then leave only that which is

373
01:02:54.739 --> 01:03:05.209
of benefit. And so God is saying, I don't want your choices to declare that I am better off without

374
01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:08.310
you. And so when we choose things

375
01:03:11.169 --> 01:03:18.649
that are never satisfied, it's going to be like us choosing one of these four things, the grave, the

376
01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:28.310
womb, the land or the fire. When we don't choose what God has to offer us, then we're never going to

377
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:37.989
be satisfied. Something is always going to leave us incomplete. In Proverbs 27 20 it says this that

378
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:47.600
just as death and destruction are never satisfied. It says so human desire is never satisfied in

379
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:55.350
Hebrews 13 5, it says, don't love money, be satisfied with what you have for. God has said, I will

380
01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:03.229
never fail you and I will never abandon you. But when we love the wrong things, when we pursue the

381
01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:10.399
wrong things, it's gonna leave us empty and we're gonna be like those four things, the grave, the

382
01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:18.439
womb, the land and fire, never satisfied. But God says that if we can make this change, then we're

383
01:04:18.449 --> 01:04:23.939
gonna be different. How many of you in this room love a whiny toddler.

384
01:04:25.989 --> 01:04:33.100
Anybody. How many of you have been a whiny toddler in your life? And I'm not just talking when you

385
01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:41.689
were, you know, from between one and two, maybe three. I'm talking about now as a grown person, as a

386
01:04:41.699 --> 01:04:47.560
grown adult, sometimes we still walk around like whiny toddlers. Ever, ever meet another whiny

387
01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:56.000
toddler as an adult ever been? When, how fun is it to be with a wine? How long can you last with a

388
01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:02.520
wine toddler? Even when it's your best friend? Not long, even when you're married to them? Not long,

389
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:09.489
you, you just can't, you at a certain point, you just want the whining to end, right? Or you're

390
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:17.330
ready to end them, isn't it true? It's just, it's just like that. And so, and so God knows that we

391
01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:26.560
can be like whiny toddlers. And so he says, well, here's how you can not be a whiny toddler. Do you

392
01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:32.570
want, do you want to hear his? His way of, of, of not being one? It says, here's, here's some things

393
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:41.679
that you can do. Number one, I want you to choose to desire the right things. Now, the way that we

394
01:05:41.689 --> 01:05:46.669
choose to desire the right things is that we always go for the things that are of, of God and of the

395
01:05:46.679 --> 01:05:52.510
spirit and not of the flesh, just like the Israelites kept doing. They kept trying to satisfy their

396
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.969
hunger and their thirst through earthly means instead of seeing who God was and what he could offer

397
01:05:57.979 --> 01:06:05.229
them. And so the first thing we need to do is we need to deny ourselves the wrong things. Now, I

398
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.399
that list is different from all of us. Like it's some things don't have the same bearing and the

399
01:06:10.409 --> 01:06:17.120
same effect on you like they do on somebody else. And, and I've seen people like be really strong,

400
01:06:17.129 --> 01:06:22.939
like animate, like saying like this is, this is wrong, this is forbidden, this is evil, this is

401
01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:28.959
sinful. And I've seen other people just kind of be like, yeah, I mean, I like, I, I see you're

402
01:06:28.969 --> 01:06:34.840
really passionate about, I just don't feel the same way about it. And these are often happening in

403
01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:40.370
things that are like considered like gray areas where, where, where you have freedom and flexibility,

404
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:47.000
where where you can do things in moderation where God gives you permission, but it's not always

405
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:55.889
going to be something that is going to be beneficial and, and if you partake in it too much then

406
01:06:55.899 --> 01:07:01.030
yeah, it can have a devastating effect on you. You don't actually know what you could get addicted

407
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.770
to. You don't know the impact that this could have. You don't know what this could do to you over

408
01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:12.760
time. You just don't know. It may be ok for someone else, but maybe not for you. And so then when

409
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:20.280
it's someone who's gotten free of it, sometimes they can be like really like in someone else's face

410
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:26.729
saying no, you've got to stop this because they received that correction in their own life. They've

411
01:07:26.739 --> 01:07:31.989
received that teaching for themselves and they know that they can indulge in it. Not even a little

412
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.020
bit because if they do, then that's it. Like they turn into the worst person, uh the worst version

413
01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:48.610
of themselves. But you have to just know that if you deny yourself the wrong things, it always makes

414
01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:56.709
room for the right things. And so God says, I want you to pursue the right things and I want you to

415
01:07:56.719 --> 01:08:02.629
pursue them in the right way. And so the right things are always made clear in the scripture. They,

416
01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:11.379
there are things that don't harm you and they don't harm other people. So even if you don't know

417
01:08:11.389 --> 01:08:18.359
what it is, you just ask yourself this question, is this going to harm me? And is this going to harm

418
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:26.519
another person? If it doesn't harm you and it doesn't hurt and harm someone else, then you're ok.

419
01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:36.549
But here's what happens. A lot of us do the things that harm us and we don't care if it harms other

420
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.000
people.

421
01:08:39.329 --> 01:08:47.569
And when we do these things without realizing it, we're leading ourselves onto a path that is never

422
01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:55.660
gonna satisfy. Here's the third thing live to please God instead of yourself. If you make a decision

423
01:08:55.669 --> 01:09:03.149
to put God before everything else, then you're going to be in a position to want to do things for

424
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.979
other people, even if it feels like you're the one who's not going to benefit. But that's ok because

425
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:15.740
you look at it from this standpoint like I do in my life every day when I serve others. When I do

426
01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:21.680
this for the benefit of others, I know that God is still taking care of me. There is no way that I

427
01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:28.589
can take care and sacrifice for others without knowing that God is gonna take care of me anyways. So

428
01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.339
I'm never worried about what I'm giving out and what I'm giving away and what I'm doing for other

429
01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:39.819
people and the sacrifices that I'm making. Sometimes I can be burdened by that. Sometimes I can be

430
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:46.100
tired from that. There are times when I can even be frustrated by that,

431
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:54.818
but I'm never ever worried about it because I know that God is always gonna take care of me and he's

432
01:09:54.829 --> 01:10:01.040
promised to do the same for you. And this is what it says in first Timothy 66. Look at it, it says

433
01:10:01.049 --> 01:10:10.549
true Godliness with contentment is itself great wealth. Are you guys content? Do you feel content in

434
01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.129
your life? You know, one thing about weddings that I really love is um when, when they take out the

435
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:22.339
the the the bubbles um whenever they start to blow the bubbles at a wedding ceremony, I I just love

436
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:29.069
it. I don't know what it is. Maybe because sometimes I'm a whiny toddler but I just like bubbles.

437
01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:34.959
Anybody else like bubbles? I have some, you want to see what, see what they do. Look at that. Here's

438
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:39.709
one right? Who's content with one bubble?

439
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:47.890
Anybody you know who wants to see one bubba if you want to see bubbles,

440
01:10:50.419 --> 01:10:50.910
right?

441
01:10:54.689 --> 01:10:55.939
We want to see bubbles.

442
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:03.120
Look at this bubbles.

443
01:11:06.339 --> 01:11:07.930
There's something wrong with this bubble maker.

444
01:11:10.879 --> 01:11:18.629
My wife kept us from the last wedding. Dang it dollar store stuff.

445
01:11:21.069 --> 01:11:27.270
Look at this, this II I envision this stage filled with bubbles in it. I'm I'm getting nothing here.

446
01:11:29.979 --> 01:11:36.819
Nothing. This is terrible. I need, I need a professional bubble blower. Anybody who's a professional

447
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:37.609
bubble blower.

448
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:46.839
I don't know. I feel like sometimes contentment is like kind of chasing bubbles. II I don't know

449
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:53.970
what it is about. Not feeling satisfied. But it sometimes feels like I'm just chasing bubbles.

450
01:11:53.979 --> 01:11:54.700
They're beautiful.

451
01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:04.020
They're ethereal, they're, they're magical. They look like they're not of this earth they change the atmosphere.

452
01:12:04.029 --> 01:12:09.459
The visual of those bubbles just floating around you and you're walking in through them and, and

453
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:15.580
you're just like, wow, look at this, it just changes everything and then they're just gone

454
01:12:18.609 --> 01:12:27.709
and they're just like sometimes a, a greasy mess on a floor you have to wipe up and, and I feel like

455
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:33.959
sometimes that's how we're pursuing things. You know, it's how we're like living our life. We're

456
01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:42.680
living our life searching for something that's always better. And it's like chasing soap bubbles. II,

457
01:12:42.689 --> 01:12:51.520
I don't want us to chase soap bubbles. I don't want us to crave meat. I don't want us to, to go

458
01:12:51.529 --> 01:12:58.729
after a bread that isn't the bread of life. That is Jesus Christ. I don't want us to go after the

459
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:05.529
things that leave us empty. I want us to pursue the things that fulfill and that satisfy. And God

460
01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:13.129
says that that thing is his spirit. There was a reason why his Tabernacle was at the center. And

461
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:20.049
it's, and it's a reason why everything that God does is about making sure that we pursue that. And

462
01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:25.700
in Galatians chapter five, look at what it says in verse 16 and 17. It says, I say to you, let the

463
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:35.129
Holy Spirit guide your lives and then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves. Isn't that beautiful?

464
01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:35.709
beautiful?

465
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.640
And the sinful nature wants to do evil,

466
01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:51.370
which is just the opposite of what the spirit wants. And the spirit gives us desires that are the

467
01:13:51.379 --> 01:14:03.589
opposite of what the sinful nature desires. And then it says, and these two forces are constantly

468
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:12.850
fighting each other. So you are not free to carry out your good intentions.

469
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:21.379
And I look at this verse and it just tells me that I need to stop chasing and stop pursuing the

470
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:28.339
things that don't provide any real contentment. And I can't trust my nature because it's always

471
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:35.330
driven towards those things that are actually not good for me. And so I need to pursue God in his

472
01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:41.569
spirit and I need to have that in my life. And I need to be like one of the 70 elders who was like

473
01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:47.540
everybody else agreeing with the people and going to Moses and saying like the people are tired of

474
01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:51.919
eating the same thing, Moses, you need to give them more. And so God says, I'm going to do even

475
01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:57.040
better than that. I'm going to give you the spirit that is in Moses. I'm going to put it in you and

476
01:14:57.049 --> 01:15:03.379
it wasn't enough because the flesh wants what the flesh wants and it battles against what the spirit

477
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:10.549
wants to do and what God desires to do in us. And so every time you feel yourself just going towards

478
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.450
the wrong thing, desiring the wrong thing, pursuing the wrong thing going after something that will

479
01:15:17.459 --> 01:15:24.689
not satisfy you. Remember this story and say God, I want your spirit instead just, just to say God,

480
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:31.509
I need you instead, I need you to fill me up. Instead, I think God's going to clarify your motives.

481
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.450
He's gonna clarify your intentions and more importantly, he's gonna give you prophecy over your life

482
01:15:37.459 --> 01:15:42.040
and over the life of others. And the spirit of God isn't just going to lead you. You're gonna be

483
01:15:42.049 --> 01:15:48.620
able to lead others into a life of blessing and contentment. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

484
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:58.080
I'm just gonna take a moment to pray and I ask that you guys just stand with me as we do that and,

485
01:16:00.419 --> 01:16:06.770
and I pray that God would help us today to, to be a people that would um hear what his word has said

486
01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:11.649
and, and, and just put those things into practice and, and I realize that we're all at different

487
01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:16.379
places on our spiritual journey. We're not all at the same level and, and when we talk about

488
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:21.950
receiving um the Holy Spirit in our lives, it's really, it's about asking and relying on God in a

489
01:16:21.959 --> 01:16:26.740
way that we haven't previously done. I, I don't know what, what's the next step that you need to

490
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:33.859
take in your spiritual journey? But I believe that there's always a next level. There's another

491
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:39.830
place that God wants to lead us and I'm not talking about how God has already been with you and how

492
01:16:39.839 --> 01:16:44.319
He is with you. And I'm not talking about how he's already come through for you. How you already

493
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:48.910
believe in God. I think that's amazing. But I, but I believe that he's, he's telling all of us.

494
01:16:48.919 --> 01:16:55.899
There's, there's a new place he wants to lead us to, there's a deeper place that there is more that

495
01:16:55.910 --> 01:17:03.509
he wants to do for us and he wants to pour out his spirit to help us get there. And so Lord, I pray

496
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:10.100
right now that we would um just think about where we are and where we could be what we could be

497
01:17:10.109 --> 01:17:12.459
experiencing, what we could be living, what we could be having.

498
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:18.709
And we thank you for the things that we do have in this life and, and for the pleasure that it does

499
01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:25.379
bring us. But we don't want that Lord to be the, the focus and we don't want that to be what drives

500
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:33.009
us. We don't want the, the success of this life to be the thing that we pursue. What you want us to

501
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:41.629
pursue is, is to be the full embodiment of everything that you've created us to be. You want us to

502
01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:47.680
be the absolute best version of ourselves, the way that we can walk in the image of Jesus and follow

503
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:52.990
in his footsteps and, and fulfill the purpose and plan that you have for each of us. And I pray that

504
01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.279
today would be a day in which we would be able to experience that, accomplish that and have that

505
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:06.149
fulfilled. Lord. You see where we are and where we need to be. Would you help us to get there right

506
01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.310
now? Would you take that spirit? That is, that is yours? And would you put that and place that in

507
01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:18.839
all of us? Thank you for what you've done, Lord and for what you're going to do in the days and

508
01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:27.370
weeks and months ahead as we learn to be satisfied with you, and we pray these things in the

509
01:18:27.379 --> 01:18:35.319
glorious name of the father and the son and the Holy Spirit. One God. Amen. Amen. God bless you guys.

510
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:43.140
Thank you so much. We have uh another song uh for you and we're gonna sing this song together and I

511
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:47.439
just pray that you guys just take the time to hang out at the end. It's so great to see you guys

512
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:51.770
here today. And uh let's give it up for the worship team as they lead us in this next song.

513
01:18:55.220 --> 01:19:02.799
Hey, everyone, I don't know about you, but I love bubbles. And um I love this song today because

514
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:10.479
it's a reminder of how sometimes there's so much that we are searching for we're looking for, but we

515
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:17.000
tend to forget that God is faithful. He's a promise keeper. The Bible says in Psalm 34 10 that those

516
01:19:17.009 --> 01:19:24.299
who trust in the Lord will never lack any good thing. So it's, it's a good reminder for us to go

517
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:30.549
back to, to the basics that Jesus is really enough that when we put our hope and our trust in him,

518
01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:35.029
that he will bring the right resources, he will bring the right people and he will satisfy every

519
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.839
desire in our heart. So as we sing the song together, um let's uh remind ourselves about that.

533
01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:58.879
See you all at the after party. Introverts. Get out of your comfort zone and meet one new person.
