Hey everybody, can you hear me? Yeah it's okay, I'm gonna shout a little bit and I'm so glad to be

3
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:58.130

4
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:05.325
the end of the gathering, we have a kids and youth program today as well and you'll be able to bring

5
00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:12.145
them into the annex just after worship and so we're gonna kick things off with the worship team and

6
00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:18.115
we want to just welcome you and we're so glad that you're here and ask that you would stand with me

7
00:07:18.255 --> 00:07:25.170
and as you would do that, I'm gonna open in a word of prayer and our worship team is gonna lead us

8
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:34.110
into worship as we begin to sing some songs and uh and get connected to God in this space. So father,

9
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.180
we want to thank you for every person that is here for the life they represent, for the things that

10
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:45.910
you have done for both in their life and through it for the way that you are preparing them for

11
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:53.300
greater for the things that they are able to learn from and also be changed and transformed from

12
00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:01.773
Thank you Lord, that today is a new day for all of us. It's a day that you have created and you're

13
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:11.733
giving us an incredible opportunity to begin to worship you on this beautiful Sunday and we ask Lord

14
00:08:11.733 --> 00:08:18.696
that you would bless our time of praise and worship as we listen to your word and as we experience

15
00:08:18.696 --> 00:08:26.786
community together, pray that you best our kids and our youth and we thank you for their lives and

16
00:08:26.786 --> 00:08:33.766
for what they're going to accomplish with them. We pray your protection over them and we ask these

17
00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:38.406
things in Jesus name, Amen Amen, let's worship together

18
00:08:53.950 --> 00:09:02.590
hey everybody, it's good to be together. It's good to just start off with a blow up bubble bang and

19
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.160
let's just let's just set our hearts and minds on where we should be and then that's towards the

20
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:15.660
Lord Jesus and this song is a is a new one I think we haven't really done this before but I pray

21
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.510
that it ministers to you and that you just receive and that you just open your heart to the Lord

22
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.730
with these simple words. It goes like this.

39
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:51.650
Amen Amen Alright let's let's warm up a little bit shall we?

40
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.260
It's good to be together. It's good to be in the house of the Lord, it's Sunday it's just a building

41
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:07.250
but we're the church we're the body we're united together and when our focus is on Jesus nothing can

42
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:15.390
stand against us. So let's get some vocal warmups in, let's sing with joy and praise and keep our

43
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.290
eyes and minds on Jesus. So

44
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.440
Start with the chorus. How about this? Sing after me.

67
00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:04.490
Amen, Amen how we doing today? We got the kids just bouncing. It's a vibe, right? This is fun, we're having

68
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:15.540
fun today. Praise God. This next one is it's a special one. This one like if whether you've been a Christian

69
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.980
for a minute, whether you've been Christian for your whole life, we can always kind of recommit to

70
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:28.260
the Lord and uh and draw close to him because in him and only through him is true joy and peace and

71
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:34.380
true fulfillment really? So think of this song as a little love letter from him to you. Straight to

72
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.960
your heart and I pray that ministers to you.

100
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:47.320
Are you guys getting used to the noise yet a little bit? Hey, you know what this sounds, this sounds

101
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.660
like what it would sound like if we were all quiet and creation was crying out and worshiping God

102
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:58.600
probably would sound something like this. We're gonna do our best with the noise but we want to

103
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:07.410
dismiss the kids so kids you have to go into the annex now and uh and then youth you guys go as well.

104
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:15.010
So kids and youth go and parents help us to get them off the bouncers and into the classrooms and

105
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:21.730
then they'll get to come back and we've got these till like late afternoon so you guys can stay as

106
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:28.340
long as you like. We've got some food coming up in just a few moments after the message. And the

107
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:36.760
last song that we're going to hear from brian and the worship team. And then we also have next

108
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:44.770
Sunday is our community kitchen distribution. So our community kitchen has been working really hard

109
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:52.760
behind the scenes and working extremely hard to get this done and we thank them so much for all

110
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.400
their hard work. Uh they have set up the fridges, they've cleaned done, they've got everything ready

111
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:06.200
to go and there's still more to do. But with regards to next son, the distribution is going to

112
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:13.190
happen after the service and it's gonna be a way for us to gauge how many meals we're gonna be

113
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:19.640
preparing in the weeks to come. And so it's an important thing and we're gonna ask you to get the

114
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.910
word out and let people know that community kitchen is back. Can we just give our volunteers and

115
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.940
applause for that? It's such a big thing

116
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:37.590
and we have four ways for you to give and they're right here on the screen. You can pick the one

117
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:43.180
that is best suited for you and for those of you that are watching online as well. Thank you so much

118
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:49.800
for supporting River's Edge and we look forward to seeing you back here in the house in the weeks to

119
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:58.070
come. And so we are going to transition right now to our message. We're gonna watch this video and

120
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.240
I'll be right back.

121
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:05.530
So the message that I have for you today is called welcomed by Jesus and it's a message that is

122
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:16.900
found in a strange place in the scriptures. It's found in a place and in a time in which Jesus was

123
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:26.860
being welcomed by the crowds and it was a time in which he was able to exercise his own spiritual

124
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:35.710
authority wherever he went. In fact, people listened to him more than they listened to the religious

125
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:49.070
leaders of the day. They were not people who would ever experience someone challenging them, but

126
00:28:49.080 --> 00:29:01.930
that's what Jesus did at every turn, Jesus challenged all of the religious leaders and he did it in

127
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:12.610
a way that made them extremely uncomfortable fact. On this particular day, we can say that he went

128
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:24.600
further than he had ever gone before. Let's take a look in Mark. And in chapter 11 and the first

129
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:33.810
verse that we're going to look at is a verse that tells us what is happening the day before the

130
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:43.280
event. And so Jesus came to Jerusalem and he went into the temple And after looking around carefully

131
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:52.030
at everything he left because it was late in the afternoon and then he returned to Bethany with the

132
00:29:52.030 --> 00:30:01.420
12 disciples. And then at verse 15, it says that when they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus entered

133
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.870
the temple and he began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices and he

134
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:15.660
knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those that were selling doves. And

135
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:23.620
then he stopped everyone from using the temple as a marketplace. And then he said to them, the

136
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.840
scriptures declare my temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations. But you have turned

137
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:37.340
it into a den of thieves and when the leading priests and teachers of the religious law heard what

138
00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:45.130
Jesus had done, they began planning how to kill him, but they were afraid of him because the people

139
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:56.400
were so amazed at his teaching. When we see the passage, we see that Jesus overturns the tables of

140
00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:03.620
the merchants and when he does this, it's such a well known story, because we see Jesus basically

141
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:13.490
losing what appears to be his patients. It seems that Jesus in this moment gets angry and does

142
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:20.660
something so forceful that in the three gospels, it even mentions that at one point he was even

143
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:31.360
chasing people with a whip. And so we look at this and we think what happened to poor Jesus for him

144
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:40.010
to lose his cool and his patience to this degree. But in this passage, if we can go back to verse 11,

145
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:50.200
we can see that Jesus actually is at the temple and he's looking around carefully at everything and

146
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.340
this is happening the day before.

147
00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:05.870
So what looks like a very spontaneous moment, a moment in which Jesus lost his cool, his patience

148
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:15.180
and his ability to control himself. We can see that this was deliberately planned on behalf of Jesus

149
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:26.100
and the Savior all along, that he was trying to make a point and make it abundantly clear that what

150
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:34.580
was happening with the temple was not what God had intended, and he brings up a few things that

151
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:47.010
teach us and show us how things are really different than what they appear in this story, we wonder

152
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:57.330
if Jesus is chasing away merchants, overturning tables in the marketplace and fighting with the

153
00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:07.910
religious leaders, then how is this message even possible to be called welcomed by Jesus? It seems

154
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:17.410
that there are some people who just aren't well, anytime you see Jesus upset in the scriptures, it

155
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:26.010
isn't with people who are struggling, it isn't with people who would be called sinners, it isn't

156
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:34.210
with people who we would look to and say they don't deserve the grace and the mercy of God. Instead,

157
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:42.560
Jesus always gets upset with the religious, with the people who seem to stand in the way and

158
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:52.660
preventing for God's true heart to be revealed and his real purpose to be known and understood as he

159
00:33:52.670 --> 00:34:00.390
intended even for the temple. And so what Jesus does is that he shows up the next day and he

160
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:10.960
deliberately goes about doing something that was important for all of us to understand how we today

161
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:22.060
are welcomed by Jesus. You see in verse 17, it says he taught them, hasn't it been written that my

162
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:30.430
house will be called a house of Prayer for all nations, but you've turned it into a hideout for

163
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:39.210
crooks. Now, he says these words because he wants them to understand that the temple is supposed to

164
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:51.050
be a sanctuary for everyone, it's supposed to be for everybody. It isn't just supposed to be for the

165
00:34:51.050 --> 00:35:00.890
religious And what these priests had done and what the system had done is that it created a market

166
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:09.740
economy for the visitors. That would come into Jerusalem for all of the feasts and festivals. So

167
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:17.640
imagine that a city like Jerusalem in that time would have about 30,000 inhabitants, but when it

168
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:30.590
would come to the time of a feast like passover That the city would receive 180,000 people, That's

169
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:39.110
like F one weekend here in Montreal or oh she aga or something like that, a lot more people come

170
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:48.560
into the city for events and so we notice that when we go out, when we see people out and about and

171
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:57.030
they would have done the same thing. Now the Gentiles, the people who they would be looking to and

172
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:04.070
saying they don't have a right to enter into the temple, they would have a court that they would be

173
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:12.240
able to access, but they wouldn't be able to go in. And so what Jesus reminds them is that when God

174
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:20.560
built this temple, when he gave you the designs and the plans for it, he didn't just do it for you.

175
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:29.930
He did it for all the nations, he didn't do it for you, He did it so that everybody would be welcome

176
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:37.690
in my house, that everyone would be able to have access and what you have done is that you have

177
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:45.620
decided and determined that you're the only ones that are welcome here. And so Jesus went and he

178
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:53.250
overturned the tables and he's like you are not going to conduct business as usual here because you

179
00:36:53.250 --> 00:37:01.490
need to understand this is a sanctuary for everyone. Can we say amen to that? That's how we know we

180
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:10.940
are welcomed by Jesus. That's how we know that God has made a house that receives us all is that he

181
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:18.190
has made sanctuary for everyone possible. And so whenever we think that we don't belong, whenever we

182
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:22.750
think that we're not welcome, whenever we think that we're not good enough, whenever we think that

183
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:30.150
we don't observe the rules and the laws and that we don't match and meet up to the standard that God

184
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:38.170
has said, God is saying, guess what? I have created my house to welcome everyone because it is

185
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:46.880
supposed to be a sanctuary for everyone. That whenever someone wants to meet with me that needs me

186
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:54.980
that wants to be helped by me, changed by me, transformed by me, guess what? I am going to welcome

187
00:37:54.990 --> 00:38:05.860
everyone and that is the heart that we have for God understood through the actions of Jesus, he says,

188
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:13.450
it's a house of prayer, it's a sanctuary for everyone. The second thing that he does, but in this

189
00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:22.320
time the story is actually found in the Gospel of Matthew and in Matthew chapter 21 in verse 14 the

190
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:30.670
exact same story, but in another book of the Gospels, it says that the blind and the lame this is

191
00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:37.740
after he had done all this commotion, after he had overturned the tables, the crowds came into him,

192
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:45.240
they loved him even more for this because they had seen the injustice and the criminality that was

193
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:51.390
behind this operation and and people wanted someone to do this for a very long time. And then

194
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:57.640
finally Jesus does it and then the blind and the lame, they came to him but look at where they came

195
00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:06.980
to him, they came to him in the temple. Now to us that doesn't sound like there's anything cool or

196
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:15.300
different or unusual about that. But you need to understand that if something was sick in any shape

197
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:22.950
way or form, they were not allowed to be in the temple that a woman who had had a flow of blood

198
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:30.370
would have to wait until that was over that anyone who had been sick would have to go to a doctor

199
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:37.990
and get a certificate saying that he could come back to the temple. It was a time in which any form

200
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.270
of unclean leanness, any kind that they would deem someone to be unclean, especially someone who was

201
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:51.540
sick he'd say. But how is someone who is blind or lame sick? They say, well they look at that person

202
00:39:51.540 --> 00:40:01.980
and they say this person is lame or blind because they have been abandoned by God because God

203
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:09.350
doesn't love them because they did something to deserve this. And if they didn't do it, maybe

204
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:18.460
someone in their family did. And so this is God's way of judging this family, this lineage, this

205
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:27.290
genealogy, this history of this life, whatever it was understood to be. And so imagine that what

206
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:37.360
Jesus does is that he says, I'm not just going to heal you in the outer courts, I'm not gonna just

207
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:50.040
heal you outside of the walls where you belong, I am going to heal you in the temple. Now imagine

208
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:58.840
that they couldn't even offer a sacrifice that had any type of deformity that was visible to the

209
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:07.830
human eye, that it had to be spotless. That that sacrifice had to be so perfect that it was the only

210
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:14.400
way that it could enter the temple and that was an animal so they could be offered as a sacrifice on

211
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:23.800
the altar. There was no way that if an animal couldn't get in that a person could and you know what

212
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:34.280
Jesus does, he doesn't just make sanctuary for everyone, He makes healing for the imperfect. He

213
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:43.340
allows everyone, no matter who they are to come in and to receive healing in his name, he was able

214
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:52.530
to touch them and deliver them over and over again and imagine the onlookers who were religious and

215
00:41:52.530 --> 00:42:00.430
who were so convicted and convinced that what Jesus was doing was wrong. Yet with the power of God

216
00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:06.970
people's eyes were being restored, their hearing was coming back. People who couldn't walk, were now

217
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:13.030
able to walk again, all of this was happening while people looked on and criticized what he was

218
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:21.200
doing. And often this happened in Jesus's life because they would look to him and criticize him, but

219
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:28.430
he had the power of God to do what only God could do. And so people looked at Jesus and said how is

220
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:36.720
this possible that he would be breaking all these rules And yet God is so powerfully with them and

221
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:44.010
yet this wasn't enough to convince them. And I know that so often in our own lives, God is telling

222
00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:52.170
you you're welcome. God is telling you you belong. God is telling you come as you are, God is

223
00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:59.410
telling you, I don't care about your past. God is telling you, I care about you today and I'm able

224
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:05.850
to bring you where you always wanted to go, where you always wanted to be. I'm able to love you the

225
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:12.130
way you are right now, even though you are unable to love yourself, even though you hate those

226
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:20.470
around you don't you see, God is telling us even now that in our imperfection that in our inability

227
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:28.100
to truly be in the presence of God in the holiest of places in this temple, it doesn't keep Jesus

228
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:39.760
from healing us. He doesn't care that we're imperfect. He knows that he's not ashamed of us and yet

229
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:47.070
we walk around with so much guilt and so much shame. We walk around with so much judgment and

230
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:54.780
condemnation. We walk around convinced that we are never good enough when all along, Jesus is saying,

231
00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:04.190
don't you get it, I welcome you the way you are come and have sanctuary come and as imperfect as you

232
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:13.060
are, receive the healing that you need today. I don't know what the healing is you need. I don't

233
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:19.650
know where it is, you need it. I don't know what's happened in your past and what's happening right

234
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:28.190
now in your present. But I can tell you this, God is ready to receive you and to heal you just like

235
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:36.140
he did on that day. He's ready to do that. If you will just go to him and say, God heal me of this

236
00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:44.700
addiction, heal me of this bondage, heal me of these chains, heal me of this unforgiveness, heal me

237
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:52.970
in my past memories, heal me in the hurt and the tragedy of my life heal me from what was done to me

238
00:44:52.970 --> 00:45:02.180
but my own para heal me by what they didn't do, as my parents heal me from what was done to me by my

239
00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:10.520
family, by my friends, heal me, set me free from it. God do it now. Let me find sanctuary and

240
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:20.380
healing in you today. This is what we can ask for, is what we can trust God. For. Look, we've all

241
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:28.360
have scars. We all have wounds, we all have pain, but it's how we allow God to deal with that in our

242
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:35.780
lives, that shows that we belong to him, that reveals that we have found sanctuary, that reveals

243
00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:43.030
that we have found healing, that reveals that we are no longer the same. Isn't that amazing that God

244
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:50.720
can remind us of that, that he can show us that. And the last thing I wanted to share with you is Is

245
00:45:50.720 --> 00:46:01.120
found in Romans 15 7 and it says that because Jesus has welcomed us like this, he's saying I want

246
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:09.970
you to welcome each other like this and so he says welcome each other in the same way that Christ

247
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:16.830
also welcomed you for God's glory. He doesn't want us to go back to being like the religious leaders,

248
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:22.830
He doesn't want us to have a church that represents the temple that he replaced, He doesn't want us

249
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:30.520
to believe in sacrifices and purity in the way that the religious leaders believed in and thought

250
00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:37.650
that was only the indication and the indicator of what the blessing of God could look like in

251
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:44.160
someone's life. God doesn't want us to be like that. And yet why is it that there are still so many

252
00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:51.190
Christians like this? Why is it that there's still so many churches that don't welcome people? Why

253
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:57.300
is it that they think that there's so much better than other people and then they judge a church

254
00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:03.560
that welcomes people because we welcome them the way that Jesus tells us to because we're not here

255
00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:13.090
to be dorman and bouncers at the door, we are here to allow people to come and have a relationship

256
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:20.360
with Jesus? Let the Holy Spirit convict, let the Holy Spirit show us what needs to change, let the

257
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:26.640
Holy Spirit reveal what needs to be different. Let the Holy Spirit do the work in all of us, I don't

258
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:35.590
know a single person myself included who is in trying his very best to do better every day and every

259
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:43.960
day is a struggle sometimes more times than others. It's hard to be faithful, it's hard to be loyal,

260
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:52.890
it's hard to be spiritual, it's hard to be a person who obeys the walls of God every day, every

261
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:59.450
moment of every day, you know what that means, It means that every single one of us is disqualified,

262
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.070
There isn't a single person who could walk into the temple, there's not a single one of us who would

263
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:15.390
be good enough to receive from Jesus. So what Jesus does is that he says my house is sanctuary for

264
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:25.080
everyone, my house is healing for the imperfect, my house welcomes people the way that I welcome

265
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:34.720
everyone, my house looks like me, Jesus saying it looks like me, like how I did things and so he

266
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:44.180
went against the religious establishment and he went for people and loved them and he met them where

267
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:53.820
their needs were and that's what Jesus is wanting to do for each and every one of us, we need to

268
00:48:53.820 --> 00:49:03.590
welcome people the way that Jesus welcomed people and that is unconditionally, can we say amen to

269
00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:14.530
that, Alright, I'm done, my voice is done too much noise Yeah, and we're just gonna turn our

270
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:22.440
attention to prayer and ask that God would do work in us and we're gonna release the hounds the kids,

271
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:30.380
because that's what they want, they want, they want the bouncers and this big one here um when I

272
00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:35.690
took the measurements of the church, the guy over the phone said, you don't, you don't know how big

273
00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:42.950
this is sir, it's not gonna fit in the church. I go, I measured it, it's gonna fit, look, look how,

274
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:47.380
look how close it is to the top where the,

275
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:58.130
it's fun, it's fun to have fun, it's fun to be a church that welcomes people, that we can have

276
00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:04.760
bouncers like this, that we can have food like this, uh I know that if Jesus was around, there'd be a

277
00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:12.880
DJ, there'd be the party would be even more lit. I'm certain of that, anybody else agree with that?

278
00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:24.390
Hey, like there's no way that we could ever out party Jesus, so I'm so glad that we get to have a

279
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:31.880
party here inside um and that we get to have this big space where we can have big bouncers and that

280
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:37.240
we can have fun together, so we've got some amazing food for you guys, but before we transition to

281
00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:44.330
that, we've got one more song you guys ready to sing together, would you stand and let's do this.

282
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:49.750
Let's enjoy this moment that God has given us. And I'll be right back to dismiss is in just a moment.

308
00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:20.780
And so father, we just thank you that we could come at the close of this gathering and just asked

309
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:29.470
that we would be received the way we are but brought to a place of full transformation by you. Thank

310
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:38.400
you that we are welcomed by you. You've created a sanctuary for us, not just in your presence but

311
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:48.000
wherever we go because you have made us your temple, you live in each of us and wherever we go, Lord,

312
00:56:48.000 --> 00:57:02.960
we can be imperfect and yet be good enough because you are good enough. You are everything that we

313
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:11.730
needed. And today we ask Lord that you would visit the areas of our life where we would need your

314
00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:21.060
healing the most and that you would set us free. Thank you That today we have understood how you

315
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:29.190
have welcomed us. But how you ask us to welcome others as well. I pray that you bless this food that

316
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:35.170
we will partake in this community, the friendship and the memories that we are making in this place.

317
00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:42.970
Thank you for today for this glorious day that you have given us and the opportunity Oh Lord to take
