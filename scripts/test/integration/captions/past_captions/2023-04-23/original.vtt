00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.040
Hey, everybody. It's so great to welcome you to Rivers Edge. You, excited to be here. I'm excited to

2
00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:45.709
have you and to receive you with our team and we're excited for today. It's gonna be a great

3
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.450
gathering, amazing worship, a message that I pray would really touch your hearts as we talk about

4
00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:59.720
peace and how we can experience it uh through worship. And then at the end of the gathering, we're

5
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:07.160
going to have a community meal that we get to share once a month. And our community kitchen team has

6
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:13.769
worked really hard to put on an incredible spread for us. And I just hope you guys can stick around

7
00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:19.834
at the end of the gathering and enjoy that as well. It's one of the ways that we love to be

8
00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:28.554
community oriented and just invite people to a table that we know that Jesus has prepared for us

9
00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:35.484
both spiritually and materially. So I'm so glad that you guys are here. We want you to experience

10
00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:41.554
something that is real and authentic and we invite you into a space where together we can worship

11
00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:49.679
God for a few songs and then experience together what the word of God and his wisdom can offer us.

12
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:58.190
And that's where we truly lean on for life's wisdom. And we pray that we would have the practical

13
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.380
teaching that we would need for our everyday life situations. Because Jesus doesn't wanna just

14
00:08:05.609 --> 00:08:12.989
invite us into a religious experience. He wants to invite us into a relationship with him and he

15
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.820
wants you to experience faith, love and hope in every phase of your life. So I want to invite you to

16
00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:27.779
please stand as we would welcome this incredible worship team behind me. You're excited to worship

17
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:34.440
with them and it's gonna be a great moment. And we just wanna pray, Father bless this time together.

18
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:43.059
Bless our teams as they serve today and make it possible for this offering unto you would be a

19
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:52.250
pleasant aroma before your presence. And thank you for inviting us into a relationship with Jesus.

20
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:59.369
Today. I pray that we would experience him in a new way that would help us on our spiritual journey

21
00:08:59.469 --> 00:09:06.419
as we pray these things in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit. One God.

22
00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:14.820
Amen. Amen. Let's worship together. So glad you're here today. If you are alive and breathing and

23
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.849
you're here and you want to be with the Lord. I just encourage you to sing the words of the song

24
00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:20.479
together.

25
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.590
What stir your soul, what matters come to mind

26
00:09:34.669 --> 00:09:35.729
the kids,

27
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:43.849
the thoughts you, it's not wasted. Time.

28
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.979
breathing breath.

29
00:10:07.359 --> 00:10:08.669
Don't stop tense.

30
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:11.809
Yeah.

31
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.440
So,

32
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:24.820
yes,

33
00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:28.140
we want,

34
00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:32.640
he lost away from.

35
00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:38.739
Oh, but listen, I saw.

36
00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:46.530
Oh,

37
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.000
yeah.

38
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.890
Don't stop dead.

39
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:33.669
Let everything, let everything, let everything pray. Oh, yeah, he's been working,

40
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.419
let it dr

41
00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:41.690
in the

42
00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:16.900
jo still comes in the morning. Hope still works with the Hope if you're still alive and breathing

43
00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:35.960
right?

44
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:21.179
The next song we're going to sing is called reckless love. God's love is unconditional, reckless,

45
00:13:21.369 --> 00:13:30.299
not that God's reckless, but his love is childlike and amazing. The Bible says that God loved us

46
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:39.010
while we were all sin, sinners. His love abounds from his infinite goodness and mercy. God's love is

47
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:48.580
steadfast. It's unchanging that we may grow distant from him or fickle in our attitude towards him.

48
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:59.330
He continues to love us as we know in the Bible. God's love. It says it does not envy, it does not

49
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:06.789
boast, it's not proud, it does not dishonor others. It's not self seeking, it is not easily angered.

50
00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:14.169
It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always

51
00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:22.340
protects, always trusts, always hopes and it always perseveres God's love is unchangeable. He knows

52
00:14:22.349 --> 00:14:31.929
exactly what we are and he loves us anyway. In fact, he created us because he wanted other creatures

53
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:40.450
in his image upon who we could pour out his love and who would love him in return. Let's sing these

54
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.359
words together

55
00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:24.830
You have been so so to me

56
00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:33.690
before I took a breath, breath your life into

57
00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:42.179
you have been so so to me

58
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:57.969
overwhelming standing with uh oh, it chases me. Don't fight till I

59
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:15.770
Hi, welcome. I don't deserve it. Still you give yourself away. Holy overwhelming standing

60
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.520
God.

61
00:16:38.119 --> 00:16:42.530
When I was your father, do you love father?

62
00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.969
When I sell love, you paid it off for me.

63
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.109
You have been so, so

64
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:25.150
win down five found

65
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:37.349
I didn't, I couldn't, I don't deserve it. Tell you your stand. Hey,

66
00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:43.400
ra

67
00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:15.229
there's no shadow. You won't light up mountain. You won't climb up. Come after me. There's no wall.

68
00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:26.239
You won't kick down lie. You won't tell down. Come after me. Come on. There's no shadow up mountain.

69
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:35.839
You all climb up, coming after me. Oh, no, no. To know why you won't keep down. Why you won't tell

70
00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:37.640
them. Coming after me.

71
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.199
You want

72
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.050
and me

73
00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:00.709
now,

74
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.089
now

75
00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:07.310
you

76
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:15.530
Oh

77
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:19.150
Crack

78
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.760
that

79
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:35.589
not or I couldn't learn it. I don't. Yes. Tell you.

80
00:19:37.869 --> 00:19:38.660
Wait.

81
00:20:13.989 --> 00:20:14.229
Mhm

82
00:20:39.449 --> 00:20:47.819
mm Down these walls. I thought by now they'd fall.

83
00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:03.680
waiting for change to

84
00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:16.020
for you have never fail me.

85
00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:27.199
Let's sing this. Your promise still stands. Your promise. Dear. Great. Is your face.

86
00:21:33.239 --> 00:21:37.199
I was still, this is my

87
00:21:39.459 --> 00:21:39.969

91
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.359
in your prayer?

92
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.000
I'm still, this is my,

93
00:22:58.729 --> 00:23:02.979
you promise me great. Is your fan

94
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.530
this,

95
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.609
if you've seen God moving your, in your life, let's take this together.

96
00:23:45.719 --> 00:23:45.949
And

97
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.959
I see

98
00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:54.250
there was,

99
00:23:58.589 --> 00:23:59.920
I'll see you too.

100
00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:11.920
I'll see you do it and you,

101
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.219
there was no and die.

102
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.579
I see you do.

103
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.619
And I,

104
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:32.959
yeah,

105
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.050
you do it again.

106
00:24:53.829 --> 00:25:00.640
A promise still stands great. Is your faith? Faith.

107
00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:12.420
This is my car, you and

108
00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:25.459
I'm still,

109
00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:28.530
this is my.

110
00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:41.719
No you

111
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:54.770
feel for no, tell me

112
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.359
and

113
00:26:53.109 --> 00:27:00.589
alright for you. The first is that the kids are dismissed. We have a great program, uh three classes

114
00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:06.189
that are available uh for the different age groups from nursery all the way up to grade school. And

115
00:27:06.199 --> 00:27:12.810
then we also have a youth program that meets every Sunday. And so if your kids or youth and you'd

116
00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:19.760
like to be with others your same age and learn, uh, something about Jesus as well with the teachers

117
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:25.969
that have prepared, then uh, just make your way over to the check-in uh at the very back and uh,

118
00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:33.489
they'll be able to lead you to the, to the right uh classroom and then afterwards, um, don't forget

119
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:41.750
to, uh, to pick them up when the service is over and uh, because they uh the teachers would like to

120
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.869
also participate in what's happening out here. And so as soon as the service services get them, they

121
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.280
can hang out here and we're so chill like we're a really chill church if the kids are running around.

122
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:58.819
Um like they can never do the damage. I did as a kid. Uh when I was allowed to run around the church

123
00:27:58.829 --> 00:28:04.569
that I used to go to as a child, I once set off firecrackers in my church. That's the kind of kid I

124
00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:10.329
was, which makes total sense why I would be then one day leading a community of faith myself. But,

125
00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:16.359
but that's another story for another time. But we are also doing Alpha and I don't know if you guys

126
00:28:16.369 --> 00:28:22.930
are familiar with it, but I'm gonna show you this video and if you pay attention, you'll see that.

127
00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:29.209
It's a great, great experience that we can all have and we're meeting on Saturdays at uh 10 AM. Just

128
00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:31.209
take a look. We had the first one yesterday.

129
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.430
Life moves fast, doesn't it? Every day? There is so much to fit in.

130
00:28:47.949 --> 00:28:54.000
But do you ever stop and think? What's the point of it all? Do you ever ask yourself? Is there more

131
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:54.920
to life than this?

132
00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:06.609
Alpha is a series of sessions exploring life, faith and meaning it's a space to explore the big

133
00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:10.170
questions to say what you think and hear other people's points of view.

134
00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:18.020
First up there's food then a talk followed by a discussion.

135
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.979
Each talk explores a different aspect of the Christian faith. And then in the small group, you get

136
00:29:26.989 --> 00:29:28.699
to say exactly what you think

137
00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.349
the aim of the talk is to spark conversation each week. Unpacking a different question.

138
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:46.069
There's no obligation to say anything and there's nothing you can't say seriously.

139
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:53.849
It's an opportunity to hear from others and contribute your own perspective in an honest, friendly

140
00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:56.079
and open environment. Why not try it out?

141
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.359
So it all begins on Saturday at 10 AM. We have breakfast together a light continental breakfast for

142
00:30:08.369 --> 00:30:14.890
about 15 minutes. And then we watch uh the video. Um There's some life teaching for myself as well

143
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.319
as discussion groups that we then break out into. I have uh three great leaders who have also taken

144
00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:27.515
alpha and who are uh able to lead those groups with me. And it's just an amazing time. We started

145
00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:34.395
this Saturday just yesterday and we had um we have 20 people that are signed up for it. And so it's

146
00:30:34.405 --> 00:30:39.785
not a small group at all, but it's, it's a great opportunity for us to go deeper in our own

147
00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:45.515
spiritual journey, ask questions at our pace. And I would completely wanna invite you in into that

148
00:30:45.714 --> 00:30:51.910
um experience with us and I hope you guys can make it. We also want to encourage you to check out

149
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.500
our uh belong groups. Uh It's not just about the Sunday experience but it's about the groups that

150
00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:02.900
meet. Uh we have groups that meet online, we have groups that meet online and in person. Uh because

151
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:08.910
we have resources that make it possible for that to happen. You can actually watch a video at home

152
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:14.430
and then some people are meeting um in another home or even here at the church and they're watching

153
00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:19.640
the same video and you can actually interact with each other. And so that is something that we offer.

154
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:25.130
And then we also have groups that meet in different neighborhoods, uh things that um you are

155
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:32.180
interested in talking about and learning more about. We have open groups like Wednesday nights right

156
00:31:32.189 --> 00:31:38.329
here at River's Edge. It's a, a group that you can drop in any Wednesday. You're free on a Wednesday

157
00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:44.489
night. Something's happening in your life. You wanna meet with others. You wanna just feel the sense

158
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.719
of community and someone who's gonna listen to you and just pray with you. Then Wednesday night is

159
00:31:50.729 --> 00:31:57.260
always open and it's always at seven PM. You use the side door here and uh you make your way in and

160
00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:02.469
you can check out all those groups. We have groups that meet in the plateau in N D G uh downtown

161
00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:07.920
just everywhere. And so South Shore, like, do I really have to name all the neighborhoods? I don't

162
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:17.790
think so, but I just me spending way too much time on this announcement. Move on. So the point is,

163
00:32:17.949 --> 00:32:24.239
we have them and you might wanna check that out. Uh, we have the community kitchen brunch today

164
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.880
after the gathering. And so,

165
00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:34.530
and I know they don't like using the word brunch when it's not a brunch meal. But to me it's always

166
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:40.170
brunch. I don't know, whatever it is they prepared. I know it's gonna be good. And so even if it

167
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:45.900
doesn't involve any eggs, I it's still brunch for me. And so uh you guys can check that out at the

168
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:52.630
end of the gathering. Don't rush off, spend some time, take your time, enjoy it. And just know that

169
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.479
this is a place where you truly can belong. And then the last announcement is about the giving. And

170
00:32:58.489 --> 00:33:03.469
I wanna thank you guys for the generosity uh that we've been experiencing uh week after week, we've

171
00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:10.569
been seeing just uh the donations go up. It makes it so much easier for us to manage our budget. Uh

172
00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:18.250
Ever since the pandemic, like so many of us and so many churches, we've really been hit hard and uh

173
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.869
and it's just been really difficult to get back to a place financially where we can support all of

174
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.040
our programming and our ministries and the activities that we used to have. And we're just finally

175
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:34.560
seeing ourselves being able to accomplish that. We wanna also finish the renovations in the uh

176
00:33:34.569 --> 00:33:41.959
community hall, which is the downstairs space, which is about as large as this is down there and we

177
00:33:41.969 --> 00:33:48.800
just sometimes just don't have the money to just to get it going to the extent that we want. And we

178
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:53.650
only, we can do that with the donations that we receive. So I wanna encourage you guys if you can uh

179
00:33:53.660 --> 00:34:00.890
just give generously and do what God puts on your heart to do and we appreciate all of that. And so,

180
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:07.670
uh we're just gonna watch this really brief introduction to the message series today as we talk

181
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:14.800
about unlocking the new levels of peace. And today we're gonna be talking specifically about the

182
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.870
peace of mind through worship.

183
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:44.040
There isn't one. So no. So the series that we're in is called peace and it's called unlocking new

184
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:50.889
levels of it. And I know that all of us in one way or another are always looking to have peace. And

185
00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:56.479
sometimes we, we go to drastic lengths to experience it. Uh One of those drastic things that we can

186
00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:01.739
sometimes do is we cut people out of our life because we say this person is too chaotic. The

187
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:06.840
situation is dragging me down. I'm just gonna, you know, stop interacting with them, stop

188
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:12.739
communicating. I'm gonna cut this person out of my life just so that I can restore peace. Sometimes

189
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:20.479
we move jobs, sometimes we take a break from our jobs. Sometimes we take leaves of absences from

190
00:35:20.649 --> 00:35:30.750
entire life situations because we just realize that we can't put up with it anymore. We're looking

191
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:36.679
for peace, we're looking for peace and we're trying to achieve it. And one of the things that I've

192
00:35:36.689 --> 00:35:42.989
often seen people struggle with, especially if they're believers in God and they are followers of

193
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.969
Jesus is that they sometimes really struggle with this wrong mental health myth that somehow

194
00:35:51.979 --> 00:35:58.159
Christians shouldn't be struggling with mental health. And I feel like that's the first thing we

195
00:35:58.169 --> 00:36:04.550
really need to address. I, I, I don't know about you, but I've, I've needed therapy in my life.

196
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:12.280
Doesn't it show, doesn't it? Like it totally makes sense, right? Just meet me for a moment and you

197
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:20.810
get this guy needs more. Uh it's, it's obvious but, but I really did need it. I really needed to

198
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:28.139
work on a lot of things and, and I needed guidance in being able to do that. I needed someone to not

199
00:36:28.149 --> 00:36:35.129
make me feel embarrassed by the fact that I needed help in my mental life and that I needed to

200
00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:42.040
change behaviors that there were things that were holding me back that had really brought more

201
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:49.810
trauma than I had realized. And, and I needed someone to help me to work through those things. I

202
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:56.260
needed to understand why I was the way that I was. And, and, and there's a work that God does

203
00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:03.620
without question when we give ourselves over to him. But we also need to understand that there is

204
00:37:03.629 --> 00:37:09.600
this stigma that's associated with mental health that we sometimes feel I shouldn't be struggling

205
00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:15.780
with this. Somehow God should just be enough. My relationship with Jesus should be just everything

206
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:20.669
that I need. And if you've been struggling with that, I want you to know that that's just a, a lie

207
00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:26.219
from the devil. It's not anything that you should be basing your life upon. And then the second

208
00:37:26.229 --> 00:37:31.969
thing that I sometimes struggled with in my own understanding of the scriptures that somehow God

209
00:37:31.979 --> 00:37:38.100
didn't care about our mental health. And, and, and I began to wonder sometimes why we were

210
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:45.929
struggling so pervasively in this area. It seemed like a lot of people were broken. But when they

211
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:54.040
went to God for restoration and when they went for Him to once again make them beautiful in their

212
00:37:54.050 --> 00:38:00.379
mind and in their spirit and, and in their will and in their emotions and in their body that, that

213
00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:08.340
there was something wrong with the way that they were practicing their faith that was allowing them

214
00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:19.629
to stay broken, that it wasn't just the fact that they weren't doing it right. But almost like God

215
00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:27.500
didn't care enough to work in someone's life specifically in the area where they were struggling.

216
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:38.330
And yet there is someone in the Bible and you've probably never heard of them. And it's, and it's

217
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:46.810
not unusual because he isn't mentioned the ton, but he is someone that is so important to

218
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:56.870
understanding this topic today because as we talk about having peace of mind this individual, he was

219
00:38:56.879 --> 00:39:08.919
someone who was leading the people of God into a place of worship. And he was someone that wrote

220
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:18.939
Psalm 88. And I want us to read that Psalm together. And I want you to see how the Psalm is the

221
00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:28.709
person who is leading people into the presence of God is experiencing some serious mental health

222
00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:38.429
issues. And it starts with verse one and it says, oh, Lord God of my salvation, I cry out to you by

223
00:39:38.439 --> 00:39:51.469
day and I come to you at night. Now hear my prayer, listen to my cry for my life is just full of

224
00:39:51.479 --> 00:40:04.840
troubles and death draws near. I am as good as dead like a strong man with no strength left. They

225
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:14.330
have left me among the dead and I lie like a corpse in a grave. I am forgotten, cut off from your

226
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:24.939
care and you have thrown me into the lowest pit into the darkest depths. Your anger weighs me down

227
00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:36.000
with wave after wave. You have engulfed me. You have driven my friends away by making me repulsive

228
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:46.750
to them. I am in a trap with no way of escape. My eyes are blinded by my tears each day. I beg for

229
00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:57.100
your help. Oh Lord, I lift my hands to you for mercy. Are your wonderful deeds of any use to the

230
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:05.850
dead. Do the dead rise up and praise you can those in the grave, declare your unfailing love. Can

231
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:13.550
they proclaim your faithfulness in the place of destruction? Can the darkness speak of your

232
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:22.739
wonderful deeds? Can anyone in the land of forgetfulness? Talk about your righteousness. Oh Lord, I

233
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:31.750
cry out to you and I will keep on pleading day by day. Oh Lord, why do you reject me? Why do you

234
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:40.100
turn your face from me? I have been sick and close to death since my youth. I stand helpless and

235
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:47.709
desperate before your terrors. Your fierce anger has overwhelmed me and your terrors. They have

236
00:41:47.719 --> 00:41:55.290
paralyzed me. They swirl around me like flood waters all day long and they have engulfed me

237
00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:05.320
completely. You have taken away my companions and loved ones and darkness is my closest friend

238
00:42:07.629 --> 00:42:16.709
and out of all the psalms that he was responsible for writing. This is the only one that made it

239
00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:21.790
into the sacred scriptures. The one that revealed

240
00:42:24.429 --> 00:42:34.860
his mental health, the one that exposed the Brokenness that he was living. Now, the thing about he

241
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:42.330
is that he can sometimes be confused with our childhood hero also known as

242
00:42:44.379 --> 00:42:55.449
master of the universe. Has anyone ever made that mistake between he man and heman? No, just me. When I

243
00:42:55.459 --> 00:43:03.500
read that in the Bible, my mind just kept picturing this guy every time. Did anybody ever grew up

244
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:12.469
watching him, man? No, you're not that old. So moving on or you just had cables.

245
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:26.530
He was actually the Ezra. He, this is what he looked like, and when we think of someone who was

246
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.969
doing worship, this is the man that we're talking about. And you know what I wanna give you some,

247
00:43:31.989 --> 00:43:37.610
some insight and some background on who this guy was in the Bible, he's described as the son of Joel.

248
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:44.379
But more importantly, you probably know him as the grandson of Samuel. And Samuel was the last

249
00:43:44.389 --> 00:43:54.570
prophet, the one who was the prophet for the two kings of Israel, both King Saul and King David. And

250
00:43:54.580 --> 00:44:04.270
so he comes from a lineage of prophecy. And so when you think of him and he is someone who's also

251
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:14.350
described in the scriptures of having great wisdom and having served Solomon his entire life. In

252
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:21.060
fact, when they talk about the people in the world who had the greatest and the highest level of

253
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:30.800
wisdom, there was Solomon and then the Bible describes someone by the name of Ethan and then the

254
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:40.600
third person is actually he. And it makes you wonder how can you be this distinguished come from a,

255
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:52.469
a lineage of such faith to have such favor, to have such position and authority and to be so close

256
00:44:52.479 --> 00:44:58.510
to God that you lead an entire nation into worship and you have mental health issues.

257
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:06.270
I I need us to understand this because it, it's for many of us here, we're kind of like shocked and

258
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:14.159
surprised by this. I mean, this guy was so incredibly talented that he had musical ability and gifts

259
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:24.590
that he's, he's mentioned as, as, as one of, of the greatest ever in the scriptures. This guy was

260
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:31.949
committed to his family and to parenting. He's described as being an incredible father and husband

261
00:45:31.959 --> 00:45:44.139
in the scriptures. To the point where you had uh 14 male Children. God had blessed him so much that

262
00:45:44.149 --> 00:45:50.139
he just kept giving him kids because they were making such an incredible difference in the kingdom

263
00:45:50.149 --> 00:46:00.360
of God. And that's like noted in the scripture, God wanted this man to keep fathering Children. He

264
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:08.739
wanted him to be someone who would have influence that way. And when the ark of the covenant was

265
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:15.139
taken into captivity and when it was finally brought back, guess who was the one who was leading the

266
00:46:15.149 --> 00:46:22.959
people in worship for the return of the ark of the covenant? It was Hammond, how beautiful and yet

267
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.360
he's broken.

268
00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:28.860
There's something not right with him.

269
00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:43.050
And when we think of Psalm 88 we think of him worshiping as a form of counseling for himself. You

270
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:48.129
know, this Psalm makes it in the scriptures because it isn't just a form of counseling for himself.

271
00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:54.959
It's a form of counseling for his people. If ever, we see ourselves going through a rough time and a

272
00:46:54.969 --> 00:46:59.870
difficult moment. And if we feel like we're at some moment just abandoned by God and feel like we're

273
00:46:59.879 --> 00:47:06.959
forsaken by him, we can read Psalm 88 and think of Heman and think about how God used this man to say

274
00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:12.989
these words when he was struggling the most so that we could identify with our own struggles in our

275
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.889
own life and know that if God didn't give up on Heman he hasn't given up on us.

276
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:28.709
And when we think of the impact that worship has, I, I want us to see that many times we're looking

277
00:47:28.719 --> 00:47:34.120
for peace, but we're not understanding that, that one of the ways that we can attain peace is

278
00:47:34.129 --> 00:47:44.389
actually through worship. And I, I, I know that we listen to, to music. I know that we have songs

279
00:47:44.399 --> 00:47:53.629
that are our go to, we have just songs, a collection of them, of, of, of music that we use for

280
00:47:53.639 --> 00:48:01.129
different things. And when I was in school, I I, and, and, and all the way through to my masters, I

281
00:48:01.139 --> 00:48:08.850
remember I, I, I needed to listen to, to certain music that would just help me as I was studying in

282
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:15.370
the, in the same way that when I found myself just being in a dark place or just feeling empty or

283
00:48:15.379 --> 00:48:22.439
feeling far from God, I would turn to, to, to certain songs that would make me listen to the

284
00:48:22.449 --> 00:48:28.709
heartbeat of God again and, and put me in the right frame of mind and just change my perspective of

285
00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:35.280
my circumstances and, and just believe in a way that I wasn't able to do without the help of the

286
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:41.520
worship that I was listening to and, and, and over the years, I've, I've maintained this practice

287
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:49.790
because I realize that I need to have my life surrounded by worship and, and when I worship, it

288
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:58.699
brings a measure of peace like nothing else like you, I sometimes don't like the dreams I'm having

289
00:49:00.699 --> 00:49:07.370
like you. Sometimes I am overwhelmed by the anxiety and the worry of this life like you. I am

290
00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:13.070
troubled in my mind and in my spirit. And there are times when the best thing that I can do to

291
00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:21.040
change, that is to listen to worship music. And I'll tell you why, because when we worship, it

292
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:30.649
invites the presence of God and the presence of God is holiness and holiness ushers in the healing

293
00:49:30.659 --> 00:49:32.830
that we need for the moment that we're in.

294
00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:44.479
See if, if I'm broken, I need help, I need to be made whole. And the only way that I can experience

295
00:49:44.489 --> 00:49:53.060
that holiness is, is by changing the atmosphere that I'm living and experiencing in the moment. And,

296
00:49:53.070 --> 00:50:02.370
and I, I love the fact that there's science behind this as well because getting help isn't a sign of

297
00:50:02.379 --> 00:50:10.479
weakness. What it is is, it's a sign of wisdom. And if he can be the third wisest person in the

298
00:50:10.489 --> 00:50:21.399
kingdom of Solomon, that we can trust God, that He will be wise for us, even as we have read through

299
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:29.679
Psalm 88. And how important worship is, I want us to take a look at this research that was done not

300
00:50:29.689 --> 00:50:39.649
long ago. And it's the neurophysiological benefits of worship. It's the worship and the Amygdala

301
00:50:39.659 --> 00:50:50.229
and the hyper activation also has measurable, psychic effects, measurable decreases. Look at this in

302
00:50:50.239 --> 00:50:59.979
depression anxiety, chronic pain and post traumatic stress, they have been identified and can be

303
00:50:59.989 --> 00:51:04.050
traced back to one daily action worship.

304
00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:14.449
And if you don't think it's possible, then you need to put this to the test and prove it wrong. You

305
00:51:14.459 --> 00:51:21.580
need to give it a chance and an opportunity for it to do more than maybe anything else has ever done

306
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:29.379
in your life. Because there's something about understanding this that helps us to understand what

307
00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:36.739
needs to happen next. Because this is what happens in worship in Psalm 95 verse six. Look at what it

308
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:46.760
says here it says come let us worship. And then the key word here is bow down, let us kneel before

309
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:54.320
the Lord our maker. You see when you worship, what you are doing is that you are bowing down, you

310
00:51:54.330 --> 00:52:02.260
are surrendering, you are giving up control and you're allowing God to have it instead,

311
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:13.699
you are surrendering power to God and saying you are the maker, you're the creator, you're the one

312
00:52:13.709 --> 00:52:20.080
who can make the difference because you are the difference maker and you are the difference maker,

313
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:25.530
not only in my mind but in my heart and in my life, you're the difference maker. In all the

314
00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:38.939
circumstances of my life in Isaiah 26 verse three, it says you will keep in perfect peace, all who

315
00:52:38.949 --> 00:52:56.229
trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you. And the word fixed in this verse is, and in the

316
00:52:56.239 --> 00:53:09.679
original language means my mind should be propped on God. It means I will lean upon, it means I will

317
00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:19.709
rest myself upon. It means I will be upheld by and sustained by. And so when we see the word fixed

318
00:53:19.719 --> 00:53:32.679
upon, that's the word. And so means this and what it does is that it gives us insight into what we

319
00:53:32.689 --> 00:53:40.219
need to understand when this word appears also elsewhere in the scriptures. And so there's this back

320
00:53:40.229 --> 00:53:47.929
story in second kings chapter 18 and in second chronicles, chapter 32. And it's a story of Hezekiah

321
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:54.580
and Hezekiah was a Godly king. He was the kind of king that turned to his people and said, we will

322
00:53:54.590 --> 00:54:03.540
not trust in anyone or anything other than God. And he tore down all the idolatrous altars across

323
00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:10.600
the nation and he turned his people back to the worship of God in Jerusalem. And when he did this,

324
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:19.379
he did it in a manner in which every person that was in this story would understand that even though

325
00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:26.870
the Assyrians were a greater nation and the Assyrians, uh just historically were what we would today

326
00:54:26.879 --> 00:54:36.840
look at and see um uh Iran, Iraq, we would see Turkey we would see Syria. So all these nations,

327
00:54:36.909 --> 00:54:42.820
imagine them being one people. And they were called the Assyrians. And they were the greatest nation

328
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:51.879
on earth that had the most powerful, powerful army and no one was able to stand before them. And so

329
00:54:51.889 --> 00:55:01.139
when they came up against small Israel, this leader of theirs, rib, he comes before them and he says,

330
00:55:01.659 --> 00:55:08.179
you're a fool to put your trust in God. And then he actually says it this way. Let's look at Isaiah

331
00:55:08.189 --> 00:55:18.520
um 36 versus four and six. It says, then the Assyrian kings chief of staff, this is uh he told them

332
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:25.850
to give this message to Hezekiah. And he says, this is what the great king of Assyria says. He says,

333
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:32.850
what are you trusting in that makes you so confident? Now, I remember the word. So

334
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:43.860
because it's here again and, and now means what are you leaning upon? What are you propping up your

335
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:51.040
faith on? And he says, there's no way that you can do this. So let's go back to the verse. And he

336
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:59.040
says in verse for this part of, for this is what the great king of Assyria. You're just messing with

337
00:55:59.050 --> 00:55:59.679
me. Now, bro,

338
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:09.340
what are you trusting in that makes you so confident? And then verse five, do you think that mere

339
00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:14.979
words can substitute? Look at this for military skill and strength? Because he, because he went and

340
00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:22.510
encouraged the people, he went and told them to worship God. And then who are you counting on?

341
00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:31.090
There's the word again, there's the, and then he says that you have rebelled against me. This is the

342
00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:41.100
Assyrian king. And then in verse six, it says on Egypt, he says, you think you can make an ally with

343
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:50.149
Egypt, it will be like a reed look at this that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand.

344
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.469
Pharaoh, the king of Egypt is completely unreliable.

345
00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:05.429
And he says something here that if you put your weight on it, it's actually going to do what it's

346
00:57:05.439 --> 00:57:06.250
gonna harm you.

347
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.370
And so what we need to understand that there's some things in this life that when we lean on them

348
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.500
instead of it healing us, it actually harms us.

349
00:57:19.649 --> 00:57:28.649
And the story here is being told so that we understand the difference between lying and relying on

350
00:57:28.659 --> 00:57:38.260
and leaning upon something that can harm us versus something that can heal us. And so if I relied

351
00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:47.000
and lean on my own strength, if I rely on my own resources, if I rely on my own allies, then the

352
00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:55.260
very things that I am leaning on for strength will actually harm me. And I know that there's safety

353
00:57:55.270 --> 00:58:01.120
in the council of many. I know that we need community. I know that we need to look for help and to

354
00:58:01.129 --> 00:58:08.510
lean on others. But when we lean on those things more than God, it is then that they can harm us.

355
00:58:09.399 --> 00:58:17.379
When they become our everything, then we end up with nothing. You see, that's what God is trying to

356
00:58:17.389 --> 00:58:23.489
make sure that we avoid. So when we worship God, we are putting our focus on something that is

357
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:34.040
greater that will not disappoint us. We can lean on God. He can prop us up. He can sustain us. He

358
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:44.459
can do all the things that we need when we need it. And the only one that I know that I can saw Mack

359
00:58:44.469 --> 00:58:56.199
on is always Jesus. I can always lean on Him. I can always lean on him and be secure. And that's why

360
00:58:56.209 --> 00:59:07.159
Matthew chapter 22 verse 37 says this, you must love the Lord, your God and you must do it with all

361
00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:19.419
your heart, all your soul and all your mind. The word all is there intentionally because if we don't

362
00:59:19.929 --> 00:59:30.270
this, if we don't lean completely on God in this manner, we cannot have our mental health restored

363
00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:38.100
and have the peace of mind that God wants us to have. You. See Hezekiah stood firm and even though

364
00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:44.850
the Assyrians were saying, who are you going to lean on? His answer to the person who was speaking

365
00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:52.760
was this? He says, why don't you speak to me in your language? Stop speaking to me in a language

366
00:59:52.770 --> 01:00:02.560
that the people on the wall can understand because I don't want them to hear this negative message

367
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:12.239
and it disrupt their mental health. And then the Assyrian chief of staff says, what do you think

368
01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:22.270
king that this message is just for you? Now, this message is for you and for all of your people that

369
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:32.169
there is no one to lean on. There is no one to resist us. You will lose. You might as well give up

370
01:00:32.179 --> 01:00:41.080
now and he challenges him and he says, if you can find 2000 men to ride the horses that I'm willing

371
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:50.719
to give you. My smallest army can still defeat you. That's how confident he was. But Hezekiah stood

372
01:00:50.729 --> 01:01:01.750
firm because he wasn't leaning on horses and chariots. He wasn't leaning on the size of the army. He

373
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:10.889
wasn't leaning on the abilities and the resources and the allies and the networks that He had, even

374
01:01:10.899 --> 01:01:18.040
if Egypt wasn't gonna come and fight alongside him. It didn't matter because he had God all along

375
01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:30.370
and he put his trust in God. He did not lean on a reed that would harm him. He leaned on the reed

376
01:01:30.379 --> 01:01:38.139
that the scriptures talk about. That is actually Jesus Christ, a reed that bends but never breaks.

377
01:01:39.679 --> 01:01:47.429
You see, Jesus is the one that we can lean on, but we have to do it with all of us. And you see,

378
01:01:47.439 --> 01:01:55.689
when we put anyone or anything more important above God, then we are leaning on something that can

379
01:01:55.699 --> 01:02:01.500
harm us. But what God says, I want you to lean on me because I am the one that can heal you. And

380
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:07.860
even when we're struggling in our mental health, just like he did. God is saying, you can tell

381
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:18.969
others you can bring that out into the open. It was a song that was worshiped by an entire nation.

382
01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:28.770
It's in the sacred scriptures to this day has broken this known seen sung and heard for generations.

383
01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:36.449
People are still talking about the darkest moment in Heman's life. And today, we can all say that

384
01:02:36.459 --> 01:02:42.610
no matter how dark our moment has been, no matter how dark our mind has been, no matter how dark we

385
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:54.679
think we are far from the light that is Jesus Christ. He can still tell us right now to lean on him

386
01:02:54.689 --> 01:03:02.840
as we worship Him with all of our heart, with all of our mind and with all of our soul. Can we say

387
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.790
amen to that, God bless you guys.

388
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:15.959
And so father, I wanna thank you for every person here and I wanna ask you to do something for all

389
01:03:15.969 --> 01:03:21.469
of us. Would you guard our hearts and minds from the evil one, from the darkness of this world and

390
01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:29.729
this life, would you restore our mental health as we lean on you and only on you and nothing else

391
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:41.780
more than this Lord, you tell us how we have to put you first. And I want you God to just change the

392
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:49.909
atmosphere in our circumstances as we would worship you as we would put our focus and our attention

393
01:03:49.919 --> 01:03:55.840
on you as you would lean on you. Thank you for what we have learned today and for how it can help us

394
01:03:56.629 --> 01:04:04.409
and how we can also experience peace through worship. And we pray this now in the name of Jesus.

395
01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.370
Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

396
01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.669
And uh we're gonna continue with this series uh in the weeks to come and, and uh right now we have

397
01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:23.030
another song that we wanna sing and, and, you know, I want us to understand that the reason I like

398
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.020
to end our messages with a song is because it gives us an opportunity to respond in worship uh to

399
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:34.750
allow God to do the work that we've just been talking about, you know, uh that we can turn our

400
01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:43.889
attention to him. I know that, that when we're struggling that we can have worship just, just change

401
01:04:43.899 --> 01:04:49.719
the atmosphere. And I like I can do that right here right now, even as we would worship Him as you

402
01:04:49.729 --> 01:04:55.570
would worship him for you. But what it does is that it creates an opportunity for everyone else here

403
01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:03.530
as well to experience that. And so when you worship powerfully, it doesn't just bless you. It

404
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:13.959
blesses the person in this room and that's incredible. It's the miracle of worship. And so I would

405
01:05:13.969 --> 01:05:20.360
invite you to stand and would you worship with me today as we close this gathering?

406
01:05:22.459 --> 01:05:30.080
And um were dismissed after the song to go and experience the community meal that's been prepared.

407
01:05:32.239 --> 01:05:39.929
And so this song reminds us of who Jesus is. He's the king of all. Let's sing it together.

408
01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:55.719
Done with. Oh, let's

409
01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:16.929
because you are a song on my lips every morning.

410
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.750
Faithful to never be.

411
01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.889
And I will declare that your love lasts forever.

412
01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:39.010
No need to my based on you.

413
01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:49.760
I was

414
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.169
and you are my strength.

415
01:07:04.639 --> 01:07:05.129
See you

416
01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:36.300
get you life

417
01:07:42.429 --> 01:07:44.260
and I feel the wind of your face.

418
01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:18.740
I will see

419
01:08:29.069 --> 01:08:29.979

420
01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.200
because we were.

421
01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.850
Oh great.

422
01:11:00.209 --> 01:11:04.569
You are dismissed. Enjoy the community brunch. Have a wonderful Sunday.
