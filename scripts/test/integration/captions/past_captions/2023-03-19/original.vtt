1
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:31.089
Alright. Well, hello and welcome to River's Edge. So glad that you're here, I'm uh Pastor Zo. And I

2
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.290
want to welcome you here to this community of faith. And we're so blessed that you have been able to

3
00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:44.059
join us together today in this space. And it gives us an incredible opportunity uh to also welcome

4
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.350
all those that are continuing to watch us from around the world and who consider themselves a part

5
00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:54.500
of this community of faith as well. And so welcome to you all. And today, we're just gonna take some

6
00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:01.750
time to sing some songs and, and at the same time to get into a space where we can focus on God and

7
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.450
take the attention off of ourselves for a moment. And yet remember that God has never taken his

8
00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:16.299
attention off of us for any measure of time. He is always focused on us. And so when we take the

9
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:22.929
attention off of ourselves, we're trusting God and we're giving him this moment so that he can speak

10
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.329
to us in a new way. And I believe that God is always able to do that when we open our minds and

11
00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:35.559
hearts to Him. I think, you know, by now that when we change our thoughts, it prepares our hearts

12
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:42.489
and when we prepare our hearts, it opens it up to new possibilities. And God is all about providing

13
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.059
us with those new possibilities. I'm gonna speak to you about a message later on in the series that

14
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:56.070
we are in called becoming the one. And today's message is about letting love bloom. And it's going

15
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.570
to be an opportunity for us to think about all that God has in store for us when it comes to the

16
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:09.989
subject of love. I also want you to know that you are deeply, deeply loved by God. And we want to

17
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.109
get to know you and enter into community with you. And so if there's any way that we can help you on

18
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:21.200
your spiritual journey, that's what we are here to do. And so when you reach out to us, we can then

19
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:28.799
take the next steps with you in the pace that you're also willing to go. And that's really important

20
00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:34.359
because we don't want to rush things or push you in a way that you are not ready for. We know that

21
00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:41.179
God has already been on a journey with you long before we ever had the opportunity to meet. And so

22
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:47.299
it's important for us to also work at God's pace in your life. And so what God is doing in your life

23
00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:53.409
is so important to us that we don't want to mess that up. And so, but we can also challenge each

24
00:09:53.419 --> 00:10:00.169
other and there are times when we need a push, you know, like we need to go a little further, maybe

25
00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:06.109
even go a little bit faster than we're accustomed to. And when that happens, I believe when we do

26
00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:11.640
those things with the right intentions, with the right motivation and with love. God blesses all of

27
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:20.510
us. You agree. Yeah. Thank you. So we are gonna just sing some songs right now and I'm gonna invite

28
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:28.559
you to just stand with me and uh thanks for making it out on a, on a, on a beautiful spring day in

29
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:33.489
our city of Montreal. Is it gorgeous out there? It just makes you wanna wake up and rush to church,

30
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.570
doesn't it? And I'm so glad that you did that and we are just going to take a moment and just pray.

31
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.890
Father. Thank you for every person that is here uh for the way that you love them, love us and for

32
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.460
the way that you are able to do something new and powerful in each of us. And today as we sing these

33
00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:54.469
songs, would you speak to us and, and move in and through our lives in a, in a new and powerful way

34
00:10:54.479 --> 00:11:01.539
as well, take the attention of God that you want to give us and we want to give that in return to

35
00:11:01.549 --> 00:11:07.820
you and, and bless you with it as well, and just be grateful in your presence this morning and just

36
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:16.280
not, not be demanding but, but just, but just be appreciative of, of what we do have and believe

37
00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:22.440
that you are going to entrust us with so much more. And so today we give this all to you if we've

38
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.520
come in here with a heavy heart and we've come in with a heavy burden. I pray that we're able to

39
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:34.500
leave it in your presence as well that we can leave this place. Just feeling that much better. Just

40
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:42.349
rejoicing in the load that's been lifted and the burden that is gone. I want to give you the joyful

41
00:11:42.359 --> 00:11:49.299
praise right now in anticipation of that. And we ask these things in the name of Jesus. Amen. Hey

42
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:54.710
man, let's sing together. You ready? Welcome the Worship team. Thank you so much. Just like Pastor

43
00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:59.869
Lorenzo was saying, this is the house of the Lord where we're going to put our heartaches and our

44
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.820
burdens and lay them down at his feet. So we just want to start with that beautiful song and that

45
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.780
sentiment. Let's sing that together

46
00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:24.809

afraid that Hallelujah,

66
00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:16.000

67
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.429
free. The Lord has freed us

68
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.150
Jesus.

69
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:42.520
Yeah. Step out of the grave. Break to the white

70
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.409

71

bring all of this

72
00:16:59.250 --> 00:16:59.809
to come

73
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.880
to the stuff

74
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.689
too wide open spaces? Great.

75
00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:19.520
Four. That's like the way it has been lived great.

76
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.300
that you

77
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:22.969
if we fall prison. Shake the Jesus name last week. So we get this Jesus

78
00:18:26.849 --> 00:18:28.500
prison shake and

79
00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:35.719
how are we

80
00:18:59.380 --> 00:18:59.930
targets

81
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.739
we and

82
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:43.689
free.

83
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.839
Hallelujah.

84
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.680
For our next song, I wanted to share this devotion that I read this week and it really touched me

85
00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:12.020
and I wanted to sing the song. The song is called Open the eyes of my heart. So I know it can be

86
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:17.689
easy for our view of God to become blurry or distorted. And there's so many things in life that can

87
00:20:17.699 --> 00:20:24.239
distract us from seeking God and push us towards pursuing other things and think about ourselves.

88
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:31.699
Our hearts can almost become overwhelmed with routines and worries and just life stuff in general.

89
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:41.489
As Christians, we try to keep our hearts focused and fixed on Jesus Christ and to, to get to be

90
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:49.599
devoted to him because he loves us so much. And so this song is a prayer that the eyes of our hearts

91
00:20:49.609 --> 00:20:59.089
can be opened so that we can see Jesus as he truly is as our lord and our savior. And so I wanted to

92
00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:05.660
just to talk about the song and how in the Bible it comes from the Apostle Paul who says in

93
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:13.630
Ephesians 1 18, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the

94
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:22.599
hope it to which he has called you and the riches of his glorious inheritance on his people. He has

95
00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:29.959
the richest richness for us. He has only good things for us. And we just need to love him and to be

96
00:21:29.969 --> 00:21:37.130
open to hearing from him. So let's sing this beautiful song. Open the eyes of my heart,

97
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.589
I want,

98
00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:10.880
right?

99
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.349
Eyes of

100
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.410
just

101
00:22:45.479 --> 00:22:45.810
has

102
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:52.180
open the eyes

103
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:06.849
I want,

104
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.069
oh I

105
00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:19.849
now one

106
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:27.910
just

107
00:24:21.689 --> 00:24:22.420
sing holy,

108
00:24:26.989 --> 00:24:32.319
holy home, holy, holy,

109
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.969

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.520
hold the eyes of my heart. I want to see.

111
00:24:56.619 --> 00:25:08.300
I want to see voices. Let's bring this voices alone. Hope eye is love. This declares the Lord. Oh,

112
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:20.420
my surprise. I want to see you. Oh, want to see you.

113
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.560
Hm.

114
00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:35.650
Ok.

115
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.050
Oh Yeah.

116
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:52.119
Awesome. Thank you. Worship team. That was amazing. They'll be back later with uh another song after

117
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:58.719
the message and I know it's gonna be another opportunity for us to, to really connect with God and,

118
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:05.180
and uh just before I get into the message, I just wanted to share some announcements with you. And

119
00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:08.500
uh the first one is that I'm back. Hey, we're gone for two weeks

120
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:17.119

121
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:22.910
never could have imagined that we could have just left for two, like left for two Sundays. Uh Just

122
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.949
because we had, you know, obviously the pandemic and, you know, just having to relaunch this church

123
00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:33.560
and just having been close for so long and everything and just God has just been so miraculously

124
00:26:33.569 --> 00:26:40.180
good to us as a community of faith, just bringing us people and volunteers and, and enabling us to

125
00:26:40.189 --> 00:26:45.829
have people. Like, just because just, you know, just stepped up and just like took care of things

126
00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:53.150

There was like a, a movie night when I was away as well called Redeeming um Love. And uh it was a

135
00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:47.719
beautiful time for them to just get into a group and then just share about the topic that we're in,

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:09.834
is then we're going to have our breakouts by our teams. We're going to go over some things that

156
00:30:09.844 --> 00:30:14.755
night about what you're going to do in those breakouts. So if you're on the cafe team or you're on

157
00:30:14.765 --> 00:30:21.224
the kids team, you're on the worship team or you're in a small group, then we want everybody to be

158
00:30:21.234 --> 00:30:26.734
here together on March 29th. Now, here's the other thing, if you're not yet on a team, you want to

159
00:30:26.744 --> 00:30:31.790
surf and you haven't really found your place just yet, We want to help you with that. And so that's

160
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:37.520
gonna be the perfect opportunity for you to come out to hear more about that. And also to then just

161
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:43.099
figure out together where it is that you can make a difference where you can serve um, on a week to

162
00:30:43.109 --> 00:30:49.939
week basis. Right? So think about that. It's on March 29. Then we have our easter weekend. He

163
00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:56.449
believe easter is almost here. It's unbelievable. It's just a couple of weeks away. In fact, Palm

164
00:30:56.459 --> 00:31:01.189
Sunday is gonna be the first week of April and then the second Sunday is going to be our Easter

165
00:31:01.199 --> 00:31:07.400
Sunday gathering. So right now, we're gonna keep it to just these two gatherings. My hope is that by

166
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:14.699
next year we'll be able to see this number multiplied, offer more gatherings for more people both on

167
00:31:14.709 --> 00:31:20.770
Friday and on Sunday. But for right now, our team is just not quite right there yet. So we're going

168
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:26.650
to just do the two and we're going to pack this place out, bring as many people as you can and let

169
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.229
people know and let them experience what this church is like and why you guys love it so much and

170
00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:36.469
why it's been so meaningful and helpful for you on your own spiritual journey. There's no better

171
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:43.099
witness in your own. Your word of mouth is what makes this possible people bringing people, you know,

172
00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:48.780
because we don't spend any money on Facebook, Facebook dollars. There's no Twitter. There's like,

173
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:53.670
that's not how we get people to come. The way we get people to come is through you, you bringing

174
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.939
people, you telling people about it and that's what's been our, our best publicity. So thank you for

175
00:31:58.949 --> 00:32:04.989
that. All right, we got four ways that you can give. We thank you for your contributions. Um It's

176
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.900
amazing to see the shift. People used to use the P OS machines all the time now. It seems like

177
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:14.000
everyone's just doing things online, whether they're sending a transfers or using the or Canada

178
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:18.560
helps apps. It's amazing whatever way you want to use. Just thank you for that and thank you for

179
00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:23.339
those donations. What makes this possible week after week. And then at the end of the gathering, we

180
00:32:23.349 --> 00:32:28.839
also love to get together in community each Sunday. And so that's what the after party is about. And

181
00:32:28.849 --> 00:32:35.459
so the cafe team has prepared another wonderful gathering for us there and uh an opportunity to have

182
00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:40.910
any kind of beverage that we would like and, and, and and other treats as well. So let's just uh

183
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.819
transition, let's play the video and let's get started with the message. Thank you so much

184
00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:27.310
that we just saw. It talks about different love languages in different ways that we um just respond

185
00:33:27.319 --> 00:33:33.359
to love, but also in the ways that we would like it to be offered uh to us, but also in the ways

186
00:33:33.369 --> 00:33:39.310
that we have to be attentive to how people need to receive it. And so what we've been doing in this

187
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:43.719
series called becoming the one is that we made a decision through the scriptures that we were gonna

188
00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:49.819
stop trying to choose the one and we would start becoming the one because that's actually what the

189
00:33:49.829 --> 00:33:57.099
scriptures teach us to do that. When we become who we're supposed to be, then it brings into our

190
00:33:57.109 --> 00:34:02.130
life. The very things that God knows are gonna be complimentary to us and that are going to enable

191
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:09.540
us to fulfill a greater purpose beyond what we could ever do on our own. Now, it's fine if we want

192
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:14.669
to be alone. But if we want to be with someone, then the person that we are becoming is far more

193
00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:20.429
important than the person that we think we need to choose so that we can have the love that we want

194
00:34:20.439 --> 00:34:26.290
to have in our lives. The scriptures that I've chosen have been found in this book of Hosea. And

195
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:32.939
it's usually a passage that speaks about the Brokenness of the relationship between God and his

196
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:38.800
people. But I wanted to look at it from the standpoint of the actual Brokenness of the relationship

197
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:46.399
between Hosea and Gomer and Jose is the guy in the story and Gomer is the girl in the story and they

198
00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:54.189
were an unlikely match. And it was only because God had told Jose to take Gomer as his wife that he

199
00:34:54.199 --> 00:35:00.649
actually does, but they're not suited for one another. And in the time in which people didn't choose

200
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:07.750
who they were gonna marry anyways, these things were always prearranged. It was ok for that story to

201
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:16.989
begin that way because most people grew into loving one another in a prearranged marriage and not

202
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.389
one that they felt the attraction and chemistry that you would imagine was necessary to make them

203
00:35:24.399 --> 00:35:30.419
match in the first place. And so it wasn't so much about them choosing, but it was definitely more

204
00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:36.030
about them becoming. And when we look at the scriptures themselves, sometimes these scriptures in

205
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:42.419
Hosea can be a little troublesome. Maybe difficult to understand because it's intertwined with the

206
00:35:42.429 --> 00:35:47.260
relationship between God and his people. And so we're sometimes trying to figure out, ok, is this

207
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:54.570
about Hosea and go or is this about God and his people who have basically turned away from him and

208
00:35:54.580 --> 00:36:00.379
have gone to other idols? Well, in Hosea chapter six and in verse one, we're gonna begin with this

209
00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:07.889
verse and it says, I want you to come and I want us to return to the Lord. And then Hosea says, he

210
00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:18.030
has torn us to pieces, but now he is going to heal us. He has injured us, but now he will bandage

211
00:36:18.189 --> 00:36:25.719
our wounds. And, and what this passage in essence is telling us is that he has found that the

212
00:36:25.729 --> 00:36:31.560
punishment of God on them and on their relationship has been harsh and, and, and, and in that time

213
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:41.060
and even in our lives today, we, we often see things happening to us uh as kind of being God who

214
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:50.949
either does it doesn't do it or lets it happen. And, and we don't see necessarily our, our part in

215
00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:57.750
it, you know, or, or, or, or how the path that we're on is, is also one that is not always meant to

216
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:05.580
suffer. But when we do suffer that God is using that suffering to bring us to a place of healing so

217
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:11.020
that we can actually grow and be better than we've ever been before. And, and, and one of the

218
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:19.149
confusing things about this story is that it's hard to find like good advice, you know, for love and

219
00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:23.979
having a healthy relationship and, and it's no different than, than when we talk with people. Have

220
00:37:23.989 --> 00:37:29.189
you ever noticed that when you talk to trusted individuals and you ask them their opinion, you get

221
00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:35.060
such varying responses, doesn't that, that, that frustrate you, you talk to one person and they give

222
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.429
you one insight, you talk to another person and they tell you something else. And it's because most

223
00:37:40.439 --> 00:37:48.889
of the advice on love is, is actually caught up in how we are to find the Mr or Mrs, right? For us,

224
00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:55.709
that there's a perfect person out there, that there is a soulmate that there is the one and it's,

225
00:37:55.719 --> 00:38:01.850
and it's wonderful when it happens, but it doesn't always happen to everyone the way that we

226
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.370
sometimes hear it when it's being told to us. And the person just tells us that they met in this

227
00:38:07.379 --> 00:38:14.675
most incredible way. And then all of a sudden in that meeting somehow, you know, they just knew the

228
00:38:14.685 --> 00:38:21.084
moment they looked at each other, they just knew that they had been just living their entire lives

229
00:38:21.094 --> 00:38:27.899
waiting for one another to finally meet on this specific day in this specific way. And that's why

230
00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:37.409
it's so much better if we understand becoming instead of choosing. Because when you build love,

231
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:48.750
instead of wishing, wanting and waiting for it to arrive fully, we can have something that is far

232
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:58.350
deeper and far more meaningful. Most of us are waiting for something to arrive fully formed. And the

233
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:04.030
truth is that we don't know enough about love. We need to be taught how to deal with the

234
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.989
imperfections that a person comes with. We need to be taught how to handle the challenges that are

235
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:20.459
going to be there in the day in and the day out as we face the journey of love together. See God is

236
00:39:20.469 --> 00:39:27.729
saying, I want you to stop expecting love and I want you to start creating love.

237
00:39:29.969 --> 00:39:34.939
I want you to stop waiting for it and I want you to start becoming it.

238
00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:42.229
I don't want you to look for it. I want you to live it.

239
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:50.129
And then when you make that shift, when you make that change, well, then you're gonna create a love

240
00:39:50.139 --> 00:40:01.610
that grows every day. A love that is expanding a love that is evolving rather than waiting for a

241
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:12.040
love that will come to us fully realized and complete. Now, I want to talk to you about this well

242
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:21.870
known parable. It's a proverb really. And maybe you've heard of it. It's a difference between a

243
00:40:21.879 --> 00:40:26.879
flower that is cut and a flower that is watered

244
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:38.120
and it exists in different cultures. There's a powerful one because when you think of flowers that

245
00:40:38.129 --> 00:40:47.810
are cut, we think of flowers that we are attracted to because they're beautiful. We long for it. We

246
00:40:47.820 --> 00:41:00.169
want it and we want it for our own. And so we go to this, this plant and we cut the flowers and we

247
00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:08.689
enjoy it as we do because we want it so desperately, so badly that we want to take them with us. So

248
00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:16.330
we can't take the ground in which they're in. So we just take the flowers, we cut them, we bring

249
00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.909
them home and we put them in a vase

250
00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:25.860
and, and then we do this because this is the flower we cut. This is the flower that we can enjoy.

251
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:33.439
This is the flower that we can look at. This is the flower that we can admire. But a cut flower just

252
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:46.260
like attraction is going to eventually wither and die. A cut flower is also eventually discarded. It

253
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:52.379
is no longer beautiful one day. And and then when that day comes, it's taken and it's put in the

254
00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:53.219
trash.

255
00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:10.320
And so when this happens, surprisingly, this lust that we had for the cut flower surprisingly also

256
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.280
turns into hate.

257
00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:20.610
And then there are the flowers that you water.

258
00:42:23.159 --> 00:42:31.989
The flower that you water is an attraction that is developed into love. It requires care, it

259
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:40.449
requires keeping a flower alive, it requires giving it sunlight and good soil and nutrients in that

260
00:42:40.459 --> 00:42:52.120
soil. It requires the watering as is required for that specific plant and caring for a flower over

261
00:42:52.129 --> 00:43:01.570
time doing your best. Speaking to it, encouraging it to grow, telling it how important it is and how

262
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:09.820
beautiful it is and how it it enlightens your life, how you give it constant and consistent

263
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:17.429
attention, how you fully experience the beauty, the freshness, the color, the scent, and of course,

264
00:43:17.439 --> 00:43:29.719
those blooms, how you you notice the delicate detail of each pedal, how love is a daily habit. You

265
00:43:29.729 --> 00:43:38.300
see the difference between a flower that is cut and one instead that is cared for. And that's the

266
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:46.850
difference in the love that God is often describing in the scriptures. You see, we know what it's

267
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:55.060
like to be a flower that's been cut, we know what it's like to be stuck in a vase until we wilt

268
00:43:56.659 --> 00:44:02.070
until we wait for that person to take the next step. And the next step never happens until the next

269
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.389
step. Just simply is us being discarded. You ever been there?

270
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:17.830
We also know what it's like to hold out to hold out for the pot filled with good soil that's given

271
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.860
sunlight and water daily. We know the difference between those two things. And yet somehow we still

272
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.219
often believe

273
00:44:29.409 --> 00:44:37.360
that although all the evidence is there that we've just been cut and put in a vase, we somehow still

274
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:46.520
believe that we're the plant that's in potted soil that it's getting the sunlight and the water that

275
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.600
it needs to flourish.

276
00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:54.929
I think we've been deceived.

277
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:06.360
I think we've been deceived into just accepting and settling for less and believing that if we let

278
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:13.260
go of this, we're not gonna get anything better. We've already invested so much and there's so much

279
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:18.139
good there. Come on. It's just to cut flour in a vase. Wake up.

280
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.739
That's not what God has created you to be. That's not what He wants you to be, but the kind of love

281
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:30.570
he wants you to have, but the kind of love he wants to give you and what you experience in your

282
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:37.760
relationship. You know, what's crazy is that this could happen in uh relationships that haven't gone

283
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:45.699
to marriage and, and, and relationships that have. This is not just, you know, a description of, of,

284
00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:50.979
of for people that are single. This is, this is the reality of a lot of people who are married today.

285
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:59.979
And so we've got to understand the difference between these two things. Maybe you've done the

286
00:45:59.989 --> 00:46:00.620
cutting,

287
00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:09.090
maybe you're the one who's been discarded. We're done. The discarding. The truth is is that we've

288
00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:18.270
all experienced our share of disappointments. Let me list some of them for you. And maybe this is

289
00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.989
going to resonate with you. You believed you were in love

290
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:29.340
only to discover that you were actually lost.

291
00:46:33.159 --> 00:46:39.729
You thought it was love only to discover that it was actually less

292
00:46:42.239 --> 00:46:48.820
you were certain it was love. But instead you had to find out that it was a lie.

293
00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.030
You expected your love to last, instead you lived instead to see it lose its luster.

294
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:12.719
That happens when we're discouraged, when we're disappointed. And maybe that's where we're at today.

295
00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:18.709
That's exactly how we feel. And I think God wants to speak to you today. If this is you, if this

296
00:47:18.719 --> 00:47:23.770
describes your situation, your experience something that you've been through. I want you to know

297
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:29.889
that God is seeing your heart this morning and he knew that you would hear these words today and

298
00:47:29.899 --> 00:47:36.610
that He would have something specific just for you. You see you've only experienced the love that is

299
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:44.739
cut and not one that is watered. And God wants to change that. He wants to see that changed and

300
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:49.629
transformed in your life, that something you may not know about me. But I, I actually like gardening.

301
00:47:49.639 --> 00:47:53.790
I like getting my hands dirty. I love doing that kind of stuff and I didn't know I like this. But,

302
00:47:54.919 --> 00:47:59.560
but I, I do and, and one of the gifts that we got at Christmas was that someone gave us a um

303
00:48:00.129 --> 00:48:05.050
Amarilla bud and it's a beautiful flower and it's a bud that you have to plant. I'll show you what

304
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.010
it looks like if you could show the first picture of, of this Amarilla bud, that's what it looks

305
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:15.419
like. It's a bud and you got to put it in a pot and when you do, you put it in this earth um that

306
00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:19.979
you know, you got to go out and get and it's the right one for this type of plant and, and when you

307
00:48:19.989 --> 00:48:27.909
do that, you have to wait that, um, it just decides to just grow. So it takes somehow just from the

308
00:48:27.919 --> 00:48:33.699
nutrients of the earth without any water because you're not supposed to water. It, it just needs to

309
00:48:33.709 --> 00:48:43.879
be in the right soil. That's it. No water. Have you ever heard of such a thing? Me neither. And I

310
00:48:43.889 --> 00:48:49.479
was fascinated by this. I'm like this thing. How is it going to grow? I don't understand. And it's

311
00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:54.550
like you can't give a direct sunlight because it's going to kill it and you can't give it any water

312
00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:02.840
because if you do it's going to die, it will never ever bloom. You just got to put it in the dirt.

313
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:10.090
How many of you feel like you're just in dirt right now, right? You're just in the dirt and you're

314
00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:15.189
looking at your situation and you're like, I'm just in dirt. That's it. I got no sunlight. I got no

315
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:18.729
water. I am just in the dirt and I look like this

316
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:28.169
and if I don't look like this, I sure as anything that is certain, feel like that.

317
00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:33.850
Now, that's a plant that needs some serious moisturizer.

318
00:49:36.219 --> 00:49:45.179
It is not pretty to look at is it? It's an ugly bob, isn't it just ugly? And, and, and, and in its

319
00:49:45.189 --> 00:49:53.860
ugliness, it needs to grow in an ugly environment and sometimes we're in an ugly environment. We

320
00:49:53.870 --> 00:50:02.860
sometimes think that there is nothing happening but everything is happening in that ugliness that we

321
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:11.239
need to bloom into the flower that God already knows we are. You know what's amazing about this plan

322
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:16.600
is that all of a sudden, it just starts to, a little, little stock starts to grow and, and it, and

323
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:23.679
it grows and it grows and it grows and before long it's like almost like a foot and a half long. And,

324
00:50:23.689 --> 00:50:29.250
and that's, that's what it looked like. And then all of a sudden it opened up and it revealed four

325
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:37.120
bulbs like four of them. I was like super excited because then it eventually looked like this. Can

326
00:50:37.129 --> 00:50:47.110
you imagine from that ugly bald? This, this is what happened. And what God is saying is that when

327
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:56.530
you are in the right soil, when you are in the right place, when you are with the right one, you are

328
00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.439
going to become the one.

329
00:51:00.449 --> 00:51:07.760
You don't have to wait for it. God has created you to become it. Can you say amen to that? Oh man,

330
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:18.379
I'm tired of you waiting for someone. When God is saying you already are, you're everything to me,

331
00:51:19.389 --> 00:51:27.760
you are all of it. And when you understand this, I honestly believe it with all of my heart, two

332
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:35.570
things are gonna happen. God is gonna bring people into your life. And the second is that Satan is

333
00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.899
gonna do this guy, same thing,

334
00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:48.439
the Satan is gonna want you to basically meet the wrong person and God is going to try to help you

335
00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:51.060
to hold out for the right one for you.

336
00:51:53.379 --> 00:52:00.070
And so we've gotta be aware of that. There's gonna be a battle that's going to ensue for your life

337
00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:12.929
for your life. And God is gonna want you to truly bloom. Now, you've only experienced the love that

338
00:52:12.939 --> 00:52:24.350
sometimes is cut that no one else watered. And so because of it, I want you to see if you're able to

339
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:30.350
identify yourself in some of these phrases. You fear commitment

340
00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:34.389
or you keep choosing people who do

341
00:52:38.639 --> 00:52:47.580
you set your standards so high, the people, good people never have a chance

342
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:58.370
that an is still on your mind and they're taking a prominent place in your heart.

343
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:09.260
You keep falling for false promises and the unfulfillment that your partner brings.

344
00:53:11.389 --> 00:53:21.330
You, keep experiencing defeat and hopelessness in your relationship. Your heart keeps getting broken

345
00:53:21.979 --> 00:53:31.330
over and over again. And you're wondering if there are any good people left in the world?

346
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.510
That's you. It's because you've only experienced the love that has been cut and not one that's been

347
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:44.139
watered. And I want you to know that what it does is that it just speaks to what's been happening to

348
00:53:44.149 --> 00:53:51.070
you. It's what has happened to you. It speaks to your understanding of love and how it has distorted

349
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:56.179
your thinking towards it and your understanding of what is actually supposed to be happening of who

350
00:53:56.189 --> 00:54:04.429
God is actually supposed to be in your life. And so I want you to think about that for a moment. As

351
00:54:04.439 --> 00:54:12.209
I tell you another story, I was university student. I went to Rome to study theology. And when I

352
00:54:12.219 --> 00:54:18.199
went there, um I went to a school that really believed that we were a community learning in

353
00:54:18.209 --> 00:54:23.689
community. And as a result, we all had chores and every morning we had to get up at about 6 45 and

354
00:54:24.149 --> 00:54:29.639
we had responsibilities up until 7 30 or so. And then we could go and have breakfast, but we had to

355
00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:35.139
take care of our own personal hygiene. And then um we were assigned to some place in the school that

356
00:54:35.149 --> 00:54:41.860
we had to take care of, that was assigned to the second floor bathrooms and it was the guy's dorms.

357
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:46.189
So it was the guys washrooms and, and, and I, I don't know if you know about this but, but guys are

358
00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:55.040
pigs. Does anybody know this when it comes to using the washroom? Yeah, zero aim. Let's just talk

359
00:54:55.050 --> 00:55:03.010
about that. No one and, and zero concern for the next person that has to come and use it like just

360
00:55:03.399 --> 00:55:09.689
that's just a reality. So I, I, I was doing these washrooms for like what seemed like forever. It

361
00:55:09.699 --> 00:55:15.709
was a life sentence it felt like and, and, and on a given Saturday, there were extra short chores

362
00:55:15.719 --> 00:55:21.239
that we had to do and, and, and someone had said, ok, there's, there's some, you know, work outdoors

363
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:27.000
that needs to be done and it was like a, a really rainy day and it was, wasn't nice to be out there.

364
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.830
And so nobody wanted to take it. I said, you know what, outside, I'll take that. I've been stuck

365
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.889
with my head and urinals for too long from toilets and scrubbing and that's it. I'm done. I need to

366
00:55:36.899 --> 00:55:41.080
get outside. I don't care if it's raining. And so I took the job, I went outside and I just started

367
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:46.090
to work in the garden and that was part of the job and, and as I started to do that, I started to

368
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:52.429
realize that, like, the time just passed and, and, and, and I had cleaned up quite a considerable

369
00:55:52.439 --> 00:55:57.489
section and all of a sudden, you know, we just went back to the regular routine and then, you know,

370
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.189
the dean of students came around and said, who, who did the work in the garden? And I was like, oh,

371
00:56:01.199 --> 00:56:07.760
man, I'm in trouble. I probably pulled out stuff that was like alive and, you know, saved stuff that

372
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:13.610
was dead and that should have been killed. I didn't know what I had done. And, and the guy said you

373
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:18.870
did an amazing job. Would you want to continue this? I'm like, yeah. Are you kidding? He's like, but

374
00:56:18.879 --> 00:56:24.510
you're gonna have to do it every morning. No problem every day. I get to do this and I don't have to

375
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:30.760
do washrooms, sign me up. And so I just did it every day and, and, and then he took me into his

376
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:34.449
office and he just said, I just want to commend you on an incredible job that you've been doing. Our

377
00:56:34.479 --> 00:56:39.409
gardens have never looked any better. I mean, you've gone over and above you, you've done sections

378
00:56:39.419 --> 00:56:43.239
that we didn't even ask you to touch, but you just kept going. And I was like, it's like, I'm so

379
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:48.500
glad that you had gardening experience because we've been waiting for a student like this for so

380
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:52.330
long. And I said, like, I don't know, I'm sorry, like I just need to correct you there. I, I've

381
00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:59.260
never touched a plant in my life because, but, but you've been pruning all the trees. I go, I just,

382
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:05.110
you know, figured it out. I said I, this looked dead and this looked like it could still survive and,

383
00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:10.770
and, you know, this looked like, like it looked nice. So I kept it and that looked really like, not

384
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:16.439
nice. So I got rid of it. I said that's all I was doing. He's like, but how did you figure that out?

385
00:57:16.449 --> 00:57:22.439
I said, I don't know, I kind of just like winged it and he was like, shocked. He thought that I had

386
00:57:22.449 --> 00:57:32.120
had experience back in Canada as a gardener. And the truth is I had, had none now, sometimes we go

387
00:57:32.129 --> 00:57:35.120
looking for love in the exact same way.

388
00:57:37.729 --> 00:57:43.719
I'm gonna say it like it is like, I think that we're out there trying to love people and be loved,

389
00:57:43.729 --> 00:57:49.560
trying to find love and trying to understand love when we don't know what it is that we're even

390
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:54.500
talking about. Like we've got no experience and we think that by winging it and going along, that

391
00:57:54.510 --> 00:58:00.129
we're somehow going to be able to lean on our experience or somebody else's experience or just

392
00:58:00.139 --> 00:58:05.790
figure it out as we go and that it's just going to automatically get better. And here's the truth.

393
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:13.729
We need to be taught how to love because there's no one out there who teaches us how and because

394
00:58:13.739 --> 00:58:20.429
there is no one out there who is teaching us to love. We have this really weird and messed up

395
00:58:20.439 --> 00:58:30.639
understanding of what love actually is. I, I, I wanna ask you, do you know how we give love and how

396
00:58:30.649 --> 00:58:41.000
we receive love? Do you know how we manage our emotions in connection with someone else's? Do we

397
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:51.899
know how to understand others and put ourselves aside and listen intently? So we get to know their

398
00:58:51.909 --> 00:59:01.100
heart. Do we know how to build and nurture a relationship so that both people can thrive? And I

399
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:10.860
think that the answer to those questions are just resoundingly no and it's ok. It's ok for now, but

400
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:19.280
we can't stay there like love is so essential. Relationships are so key. I, I don't understand why

401
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:27.379
we stay in a place of ignorance that we don't try to grow in this area and try to push ourselves to

402
00:59:27.389 --> 00:59:33.489
do this better. Instead of just moving on to the next person who's just gonna break our heart

403
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:44.239
or wait for them to just not be able to fulfill us. Instead of understanding how we need to go into

404
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:47.010
a relationship already feeling fulfilled.

405
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:55.830
You see, it's so different than what we may have understood from the past. You know, what's crazy

406
00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.770
about our English language is that we, we don't have a lot of words to describe love. But, you know,

407
01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:07.959
the Ancient Greeks in the Scriptures, they had seven different ways of describing it. There's seven

408
01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:14.709
ways that they spoke about love and then there's some cultures that have as many as 15 and they

409
01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:20.149
break it down so that they have an understanding of the type of love that we're talking about. And

410
01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:25.699
here we are, you know, in the moment of attraction and infatuation, in the moment of sexual arousal

411
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:30.969
and in chemistry, in the moment in which we just feel that we've got a connection. We sometimes

412
01:00:30.979 --> 01:00:38.979
already are talking about love. We have no idea what it is that we're experiencing. What's the

413
01:00:38.989 --> 01:00:44.800
emotion that we're really having in that moment. And so the Greeks talked about eros a sexual and

414
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:50.129
passionate love they talked about Philia which was a friendship, love. They talked about Storge which was

415
01:00:50.139 --> 01:00:56.820
a familial love. They talked Agape which was a universal God love, Ludus, which was a casual non

416
01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:04.600
committal type of love. Pragma, which was duty and interest and which was self love. And each of

417
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:10.629
these had a different way of just describing and explaining so that people knew exactly where they

418
01:01:10.639 --> 01:01:18.750
were in this spectrum of, of this emotion that we so often misinterpret and misunderstand. I, I'll

419
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:26.649
give you an example of how we can misunderstand love. You know, examples of love that although love

420
01:01:26.659 --> 01:01:31.649
is all around us, it's usually expressed in a form that does not help us. And here's what I'm

421
01:01:31.659 --> 01:01:37.719
talking about, you know, because the truth is that some people are just wing it,

422
01:01:40.939 --> 01:01:50.300
some are still looking for it. Some are ghosting you for it.

423
01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:57.800
Some are leading others on for it.

424
01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:09.949
Some still can't figure out how to make it work. Some are just settled in and stuck without it

425
01:02:11.649 --> 01:02:22.370
somewhere together but not in love. Some are in love but they're not good for each other. Some could

426
01:02:22.379 --> 01:02:31.489
never seem to stay in love and some still don't know what true love is and how to show it. Do you

427
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:39.550
see any truth in that in the examples that we may have had? And maybe you were raised in a home

428
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.570
where you had a, an incredible example of what a loving marriage and relationship is like. Maybe you

429
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:50.679
had parents who, who loved each other and then I'm like, I don't know, I didn't have that. I was

430
01:02:50.689 --> 01:02:54.729
messed up when I, when I used to see my parents and I, I can understand my mom's commitment. I just

431
01:02:54.739 --> 01:03:00.320
tell my mom, I used to wake up and say mom, are you still with this guy? Like, really? Why don't you

432
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:04.600
leave? Like she was like, I'm not gonna never gonna leave your husband. I'm never going to leave my

433
01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:09.770
husband. I'm never gonna leave your father. I'm like, please leave him. Sometimes I'd have that

434
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:16.340
conversation with her. I saw how much she was suffering. I saw how, how, how, how, how he said he

435
01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:21.429
loved her but he just mistreated her. I couldn't take it. My problem wasn't that my father didn't

436
01:03:21.439 --> 01:03:24.600
love me. My problem with my father was that he didn't know how to love my mother. Does that make

437
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:32.040
sense? He was always loving me. He was proud of me. He would always like talk about me and just put

438
01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:37.969
me in roles and responsibilities and give me positions of authority at the youngest most possible

439
01:03:37.979 --> 01:03:43.669
age. He believed in me so much and I hated him for that because I couldn't stand the way he couldn't

440
01:03:43.679 --> 01:03:50.409
love my mother the way that I knew she deserved to be. And I need you to understand this because

441
01:03:50.419 --> 01:03:56.310
sometimes when you don't have a good example of it, it just, it just messes you up and, and, and

442
01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.129
when we look at getting advice. It's even worse. Can I just talk to you a bit about this for a

443
01:04:01.139 --> 01:04:08.649
moment? Because advice on love is this is that everyone's got advice and who's right? And, and, and

444
01:04:08.659 --> 01:04:14.030
whose advice do you actually follow? And I just want to give you some examples of that? Ok. One is

445
01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:20.750
when people tell you, you know, love is all that you need. Have you heard that one before? Love is

446
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:26.239
all that you need. And then the next person comes along and says, love isn't going to be enough.

447
01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:35.739
And then someone comes along and says, when you meet your soul mate, you'll know. And then someone

448
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:38.320
else says, there's no such thing as a soul mate.

449
01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:46.360
Someone comes in, they say, don't worry, be patient, you can change them and someone else will come

450
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.909
and say get out, you can't change them.

451
01:04:51.449 --> 01:04:56.409
Someone will come and they'll say relationships should be easy and someone else will come.

452
01:04:56.419 --> 01:04:58.770
Relationships are supposed to be hard. What did you expect?

453
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.620
Someone's going to come along? And it says it makes sense because you know, opposites attract and

454
01:05:08.629 --> 01:05:13.459
then someone is gonna come along and says, forget it, opposites attract. Look for someone that's

455
01:05:13.469 --> 01:05:14.199
just like you.

456
01:05:16.709 --> 01:05:23.189
Someone will come along and say chemistry is everything and then someone will say, don't count on

457
01:05:23.199 --> 01:05:24.770
chemistry because that doesn't last

458
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:32.399
for every advice that is out there on love. There is an opposite advice for it. You've noticed that.

459
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.020
It's kind of like government studies.

460
01:05:37.739 --> 01:05:43.909
It's kind of like help studies. Wine is good for you. No, it's giving you cancer chocolate is good

461
01:05:43.919 --> 01:05:49.500
for you. No, it's not. It's giving you cancer. Broccoli is good for you. No, broccoli is trying to

462
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:54.280
kill you. It gives you cancer. Have you noticed that everything gives you cancer. It's trying to

463
01:05:54.290 --> 01:06:00.469
kill you. Everybody's eating meat because anything that came from the ground is supposed to kill us

464
01:06:00.479 --> 01:06:05.260
because it's got so many carcinogens that we can't even digest that stuff. We're not supposed to

465
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.280
because it doesn't want to be plucked. That's his only defense system. Why am I talking about this?

466
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:15.179
I have no idea, but I just was going on a little bit of a rant there frustrated with information,

467
01:06:15.189 --> 01:06:20.929
right? There's like for, for everything that people are telling you one day the next day, it seems

468
01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:27.030
like that information was wrong and it's like this is gonna give you long life. No, this is gonna

469
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:35.020
shorten your life. Incredibly, don't do it. And then we wonder why we are so confused. And I, I, I

470
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:42.560
want us to look at another verse in, in, in Hosea and chapter six verse four and in Hosea six and in

471
01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:51.340
verse four, it says, oh Israel and Judah, what should I do with you? Ask the Lord for your love

472
01:06:51.350 --> 01:07:02.199
vanishes like the morning mist. Look at this and it disappears like dow in the sunlight and it's

473
01:07:02.209 --> 01:07:15.250
talking about love and how quickly it's there and how quickly it's not how quickly it comes and how

474
01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:22.810
quickly it disappears. And I don't want you to have a love that looks like that. I want you to have

475
01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:28.560
a love that lasts. I want you to understand what that is and what that looks like. And so we're

476
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:34.280
gonna talk about what the scriptures teach on this topic and I want you to know that these are the

477
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:43.929
four paths that make love bloom. And the 1st 1 is preparing for love. It's about learning to love

478
01:07:43.939 --> 01:07:52.399
yourself in solitude. Now, I want to make a distinction between solitude and loneliness because I

479
01:07:52.409 --> 01:07:55.689
need you to understand the difference. The difference is this

480
01:07:57.830 --> 01:08:00.620
solitude is about being alone with purpose,

481
01:08:04.219 --> 01:08:06.979
solitude is about being alone with intention.

482
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:16.700
Solitude is about working on yourself and knowing that you need this at this point and stage in your

483
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:22.979
life because you're preparing for love. And the worst thing that you can do is move into something

484
01:08:22.988 --> 01:08:29.519
else when you know that you have yet to understand yourself, heal your pain, care for yourself.

485
01:08:31.889 --> 01:08:36.159
And so God is saying, I need you to understand that if you are going to be prepared for love, then

486
01:08:36.168 --> 01:08:43.409
you are gonna have to learn how to express compassion and care to the lonely in your own solitude

487
01:08:44.759 --> 01:08:51.369
that when you can do this in your solitude, when you can care, when you can show love when you can

488
01:08:51.378 --> 01:09:00.149
be compassionate towards others, instead of wallowing in your own stuff, then you are ready for love

489
01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:07.629
because you have built empathy and patience through the most difficult time and period of your life.

490
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.069
And as a result, you have been prepared for love. Can we say amen to that?

491
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:24.069
The second path to love? It's called practicing it, practicing it because you extend love to others

492
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:32.370
while loving all on ourselves. Thank you. And I'm telling you that we are dealing with a lot of

493
01:09:32.379 --> 01:09:40.160
Brokenness and a shattered image of who we are. Truly. The only way that I understood who I was and

494
01:09:40.169 --> 01:09:46.729
who I continue to be is when I see myself through the eyes of Jesus and not through my own. See the

495
01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.720
moment I start looking at myself through my own eyes or through the eyes of others, then the

496
01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:56.819
Brokenness just comes back and it just leads me away from love and not towards it. But the moment I

497
01:09:56.830 --> 01:10:03.939
see myself through the eyes of Jesus, it restores me to an image that I know I've always had. But

498
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:10.750
I've got to keep working on it and I've got to keep practicing love to be able to consistently

499
01:10:10.759 --> 01:10:16.990
experience it in my own life. And when and when someone comes into your life and you know, this

500
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.310
person is broken and you know that they're manipulating you and you know that they're not even sure

501
01:10:21.319 --> 01:10:26.850
of why they're drawn to you or want to be in your circle or in your life or maybe even in your bed,

502
01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:33.080
you're gonna have to make a decision in that moment. That's gonna tell you, this is a person who is

503
01:10:33.089 --> 01:10:38.279
not prepared for love. This is a person who is not ready to practice love the way God wants me to

504
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:43.720
practice it. This is a person here to distract me and to remove me from the blessing that God has in

505
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:49.029
store for me. This is a person who's coming into my life to waste my life and not to enhance it. And

506
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:56.540
so in Jesus name, I rebuke this, I do not want this. I resist and I run from it because I know this

507
01:10:56.549 --> 01:11:03.919
is not of the Lord. See when you're practicing love, you're able to practice it because you've been

508
01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:09.959
prepared for it. In the moments of solitude, you were able to do the work that makes you aware. It

509
01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:16.250
gives you clarity in the moment that the opportunity to practice love shows up in that moment. You

510
01:11:16.259 --> 01:11:20.879
are now able to see things and do things and experience things. But more importantly, to see things

511
01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:26.740
for what they truly are. God is giving you insight into dealing with their preferences. He's showing

512
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:32.450
you what their personalities are really like. He's showing you if they really have values that you

513
01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:38.640
can share. He's revealing if you're going to be able to have the same goals to walk on the same path

514
01:11:38.649 --> 01:11:43.299
to have the same purpose to have the success that you both need and desire in this life.

515
01:11:45.959 --> 01:11:54.700
You see when God brings you to a place of preparation, he also brings you to a place of practice and

516
01:11:54.709 --> 01:12:00.330
he looks at you and he says, come on, be real. Do you really have alignment with this person?

517
01:12:02.359 --> 01:12:08.430
Are they really going to be able to walk with you in this life? Are you really gonna be able to

518
01:12:08.439 --> 01:12:14.580
build something with them? Is the foundation gonna be strong enough to withstand the storms when

519
01:12:14.589 --> 01:12:24.310
they come? Because they will, are you gonna be able to still love them even after they have shown

520
01:12:24.319 --> 01:12:34.379
you how there was a moment in their laps of care and concern towards you that they showed you how

521
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:35.569
they didn't love you.

522
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:44.830
I want to talk to you about how the 3rd path is called protecting love. You see, in the story in

523
01:12:44.839 --> 01:12:54.790
which we're in, Jose was called to protect Gomer from herself. You know, he, she ended up getting

524
01:12:54.799 --> 01:13:00.859
pregnant three times and, and, and then the scriptures tell us that at least two of those times were

525
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:03.430
certain of they were not Hosea

526
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:15.640
and yet God calls on Jose to protect Gomer. He calls on him to go out and to do whatever he can to

527
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:23.910
free her and to bring her back home and to keep doing it as often. And I, I I it was necessary. He,

528
01:13:23.919 --> 01:13:30.319
he was showing he was showing Hosea, but he's also showing us what it looks like to protect love, uh

529
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:38.120
what it looks like to offer a love that stands up to the change and to the challenges of this life.

530
01:13:38.939 --> 01:13:46.299
And so when we're with people, God is going to show us, is this a person that we can be committed to,

531
01:13:47.779 --> 01:13:56.390
is this a person who stands up to change who faces challenges and is able to overcome them. You want

532
01:13:56.399 --> 01:14:01.740
to be with someone and love someone and be loved by someone who shows you these characteristics.

533
01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:11.399
You want someone who is not going to allow things to block your love, someone who's going to

534
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:18.020
identify what they are and is going to speak about them. And even if they don't have the most

535
01:14:18.029 --> 01:14:22.740
articulate way and maybe they don't have all the words in which to do it and maybe they don't know

536
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:29.299
how to address it exactly. And maybe what we're looking at is more at intention and less at tat

537
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:36.640
because sometimes the attack just isn't there right? But when we look at intention and we look at

538
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:42.100
motivation, we see a person who's saying I'm going to protect this love. And so I see that something

539
01:14:42.109 --> 01:14:47.229
is wrong. I see that you're distant. I see that you're not the same. I see that when you look at me,

540
01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.959
you look past me through me, you're ignoring me. I see that we're not touching each other. We don't

541
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:59.209
kiss our lips anymore. We don't touch our bodies. I see that there's things that are wrong. I want

542
01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:03.899
you to be with someone who's not going to allow love to be blocked. (Amen.)

543
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:13.240
You see when you see someone like that fighting and wanting more and not allowing things to be as

544
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:18.600
they are because there's a moment in which we all get tired. We, we struggle, we just say, oh,

545
01:15:18.609 --> 01:15:23.839
what's the point? You know, I've said everything I could possibly say. I, I've said it in so many

546
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:33.209
ways. I, I've given him attention. I've ignored him. I've, I brought it up with her family. I've

547
01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:40.310
spoken to therapists about it with, with and without them. And I'm just, at that point where I'm

548
01:15:40.319 --> 01:15:45.729
just like there's nothing more that I, that I can do really,

549
01:15:51.419 --> 01:15:57.060
you know, I, I know that God gives us permission to walk away. I know that,

550
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.729
but I hate the way that we do it so quickly

551
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:12.850
and we do it so easily. Not everyone but a lot of us. I hate the way that we move on and just, just

552
01:16:12.859 --> 01:16:17.819
feel like we can just turn the page because people are just, you know, cut flowers in the vase.

553
01:16:22.759 --> 01:16:30.689
It's just so wrong. And you know what? I, I know that God has already shown you that this person

554
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:36.229
already thought this way and acted this way and revealed themselves to be this way long before he

555
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:44.529
ever committed to that. But because you weren't prepared because you didn't practice, there's

556
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.790
nothing to protect your life now.

557
01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:54.720
It's not just about not having good examples. It's about not doing the work to be a good example.

558
01:16:56.759 --> 01:17:01.709
I, I want to just move past that, you know, and, and, and, and, and, and understand what it looks

559
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:10.069
like to forgive a person, really, like, honestly forgive and move past and, and not just forgive and

560
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:17.370
move past. But, but here's the third part that a lot of people just never attain heal. I, I've seen

561
01:17:17.379 --> 01:17:24.310
people forgive and I've seen them move past, but I haven't seen them here. They don't get to that

562
01:17:24.319 --> 01:17:32.450
3rd stage. And I tell you, there is no way you can protect your love. If you haven't given God the

563
01:17:32.459 --> 01:17:34.470
opportunity to heal you,

564
01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.930
you are not strong enough to protect it and you are not strong enough to protect yourself. How are

565
01:17:42.939 --> 01:17:48.169
you going to protect your love in a relationship? How are you going to do that? And, and so God

566
01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:56.229
wants us to understand that we must sacrifice, truly sacrifice to find true love and to keep it. Do

567
01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.020
you believe that?

568
01:18:06.009 --> 01:18:07.680
Thank you. four people. I love it.

569
01:18:10.209 --> 01:18:17.250
There may have been 1/5 there. I'm not sure, but I clearly saw four. Here's the last point. You

570
01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:21.390
ready for the last point? Yeah, I know you've been ready for, for 20 minutes. But are you really

571
01:18:21.399 --> 01:18:25.910
ready for the last point? What do you think? I was going to come back all refreshed and not preach a

572
01:18:25.919 --> 01:18:36.709
good message? Come on I did the work. I did the work. It wasn't all vacation. I had to do this.

573
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:44.720
I want you to hear what it looks like to offer. Perfecting love. You want to hear it because it's

574
01:18:44.729 --> 01:18:45.689
not just about

575
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:53.629
being prepared for it and practicing it and then protecting it, but it's about perfecting it. And

576
01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.890
God says that there's the greatest of all loves is, is, is, is a non

577
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:13.839
conditional type of love. It is loving without condition and, and I, I know it's hard to do this.

578
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:20.379
But have you ever practiced extending love to every moment and every person in your life

579
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:30.379
and just think about this, extending love to every moment and every person in your life just

580
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:38.129
offering love non-conditionally. You know, that Jesus remains today as the only person who has ever

581
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.930
said and taught love your enemy.

582
01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.770
No one else has ever said that in the world

583
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:58.240
and taught that like Jesus has and I need you to understand that that difference in loving your

584
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.830
enemy

585
01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:11.339
is all about unconditional love. It's about loving every moment and every person in every

586
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:18.299
circumstance of this life. And God is saying, my love is so perfect. In fact, when the Bible

587
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:28.479
describes God, it says that God is love, that God is so perfect. Listen to this, that God becomes

588
01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:37.020
the embodiment of that love in the person of Jesus. So that when we say I received Jesus into my

589
01:20:37.029 --> 01:20:46.520
life, what that means is I receive God's love and I promise to be love in this world. Oh, man, some

590
01:20:46.529 --> 01:20:55.069
people just thought it was about salvation. No, no, no. If God is love, it's about allowing God to

591
01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:04.419
love us and then to reveal that love through us. And so the perfect love that God wants us to

592
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:10.240
express is a love that is boundless, that it cannot be measured. The Bible describes it as something

593
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:23.350
that is so wide and then some high and that it is so deep that it is actually boundless. And he says

594
01:21:23.359 --> 01:21:29.660
that nothing can separate us from that love. That love is so perfect that there is nothing that we

595
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:39.080
can do that can ever get Him to stop loving us. And he's saying, do you get this so that you

596
01:21:39.089 --> 01:21:48.240
understand it for yourself? See, offer a love that doesn't wait to be received first,

597
01:21:50.279 --> 01:21:58.439
be love in the situation that you're in instead of waiting for it to come to you every time, stop

598
01:21:58.450 --> 01:22:07.029
waiting for that person to reveal sacrifice before you show love, show love. Even when it isn't

599
01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:16.290
received. Learn how to keep loving even as things change. Demonstrate and live that love that is

600
01:22:16.299 --> 01:22:23.810
rooted in obedience to who God is and the commitment that He has made to each and every one of us,

601
01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:30.109
every day when I'm out there, I remember that God is love and I got to show love in this situation.

602
01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:38.540
I got to be love in this circumstances. I, I have to be love in this moment. I don't wanna show love.

603
01:22:38.549 --> 01:22:42.399
I don't wanna be love in this moment. This, in this moment. I just want to be angry. You ever been

604
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.779
there?

605
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:49.509
Sometimes you just, you just wanna be upset with the situation that you're in. You just, you just

606
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.709
wanna, you just wanna be angry at the person. You don't wanna love them because you've, you've been

607
01:22:53.720 --> 01:23:01.270
disrespected by them. How can you show love in a moment when you haven't been shown love? God says

608
01:23:02.339 --> 01:23:09.399
the love that you need doesn't come from you. It comes from me. It's gonna come from me into you.

609
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:16.270
It's gonna flow from you into them. People will be changed by love more than they could ever be

610
01:23:16.279 --> 01:23:22.529
changed by your words and your anger, your frustration and your inability to maybe articulate the

611
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.930
situation and express your feelings to the extent that you need to. You can speak love and that

612
01:23:27.939 --> 01:23:34.439
person can be broken by it, changed and transformed by it because it isn't your love. It's God's

613
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:40.319
love that is working in you and through you and God is putting you in a position to experience it

614
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:48.970
like never before. And so let's stop choosing and start becoming God bless you. Guys, thank you so

615
01:23:48.979 --> 01:23:49.459
much.

616
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.319
I don't know how long I spoke for, but it feels like it was a minute. I don't know. It just, it

617
01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:09.330
might have been too long. I apologize next week. I'll be back on track, but I just wanted to just uh

618
01:24:09.339 --> 01:24:17.600
convey our um just incredibly heartfelt condolences uh to Sharona, she lost her husband two weeks

619
01:24:17.609 --> 01:24:25.140
ago. Um And while I was away, she had to wait to be able to um you know, just do a funeral for him

620
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:30.930
and, and uh she waited for my return to be able to do that. And, Sharona I just, I can't believe you

621
01:24:30.939 --> 01:24:39.359
lost your love of your life, Arnie. And uh uh he was so young, taken too soon. Um And I just, I

622
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:45.509
loved how well you were surrounded by, by friends and family and, and how so many people spoke so

623
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:52.660
wonderfully and powerfully about him and, and um and the way you spoke about him too and about your

624
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:59.160
life and your love. And we talked about this and I know that God's got something in store for you

625
01:24:59.169 --> 01:25:03.169
and, and in the moment of your pain and the moment of your grieving, I know that he's going to

626
01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:10.660
continue to show you his love and help you through this moment. And so can we just take a moment and

627
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:15.850
just pray for Sharona? Would you do that and join me as you would do that? And so father we want to

628
01:25:15.859 --> 01:25:20.080
pray for Sharona and we thank you for the life that you gave Arnie and for the way that you brought

629
01:25:20.089 --> 01:25:31.450
them together, and you gave them an incredible time of life together on this earth. And that has

630
01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:37.779
come to an end and one day they will see each other again. But until then, Lord I pray that you

631
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:44.430
would continue to work powerfully in Shana's life that you would encourage her and that you would

632
01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:52.620
keep showing her revealing to her the next steps in her life, she would protect her from the enemy's

633
01:25:52.629 --> 01:26:00.310
attacks and from the grief that would possibly just overtake her and that you would help her to

634
01:26:00.319 --> 01:26:09.979
overcome with your love. I know she loves you, believes in you and follows you. And so I know Lord

635
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:14.890
that you are going to see her through this and as a community of faith, we are here for her as well

636
01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:22.979
and we will keep praying for her and trusting that you God are gonna work all things for her good.

637
01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:34.080
And we pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. God bless you, Sharona and God bless all of you.

638
01:26:34.549 --> 01:26:39.750
Thank you so much for being a part of this gathering today. And um going through this message with

639
01:26:39.759 --> 01:26:45.270
me, I'm going to continue the series next week and then we're gonna just turn our attention to

640
01:26:45.279 --> 01:26:49.549
Easter and we're gonna have a couple of Sundays on that and we're gonna look at Easter from a

641
01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:55.229
different perspective as you know, I love to do. And um, and we're just gonna worship right now with

642
01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:00.620
this next song. Would you stand with me as we would do that? And I pray that this would be a good

643
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:05.560
opportunity for us to talk to God. Even if we're not singing the words of the song. It's a good way

644
01:27:05.569 --> 01:27:10.220
for us to just talk to the Lord, to talk to Jesus and just let him know what's on our minds, what's

645
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:16.839
on our hearts, what we're going through, what we need God to do, how we need him to help us and, and

646
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:23.250
how we need him to work through us. And I know that many of us are um in, in a place in which we

647
01:27:23.259 --> 01:27:30.580
need God. Oh, before we sing, is that Gabby? Is that you are you here? Hey, Gabby. Gabby was in a, a

648
01:27:30.589 --> 01:27:37.169
really bad car accident. We prayed for you, Gabby and we know that you had to have surgery and we're

649
01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:44.399
so glad that you're here. Can we just praise God for Gabby and just how God was, was with you? How

650
01:27:44.410 --> 01:27:45.890
he continues to be with you?

651
01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:56.779
I love that. Thank you for being here. Gabby. God bless you. Ok, let me see if I forget anybody else.

652
01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:03.410
I don't want to do that. Um But as you can, as you can tell, I, I, I, I know my peeps, I know my

653
01:28:03.419 --> 01:28:10.430
people and I'm glad for that. And if we don't know each other, we got to do something about that. We

654
01:28:10.439 --> 01:28:14.950
gotta do something about that. So let's sing this song and then I'll see you guys at the after party,

655
01:28:14.959 --> 01:28:20.140
hang around, stick around. I know you got places to be, maybe, maybe somewhere else right after this.

656
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:24.379
But if you could just stick around for a few moments, that's amazing. God bless you. Thank you so

657
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.819
much.

658
01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:40.209
Let's sing this new song from Mosaic called You are Mine. And we usually use those words in a

659
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:48.660
romantic way. And this is gonna be in a romantic way to say to our Lord that he is ours and is a

660
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:51.120
beautiful love message.

661
01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:54.790
Let's sing this together on

662
01:29:02.729 --> 01:29:05.870
