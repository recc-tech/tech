00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:30.840
Well, welcome to our summer gatherings at River's Edge. We're so glad that you're here and that you

2
00:09:30.849 --> 00:09:36.890
didn't have any plans. Thank you. It's awesome. We are glad that you have joined us for this

3
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.690
gathering and we are so blessed that you could be a part of this experience with us. We want to

4
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:47.469
remind you that the youth ministry starts every Sunday at 10 a.m. and then of course, the kids

5
00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:54.630
ministry begins at 10 30 now with their own worship. And we have uh members of our worship team that

6
00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.200
are leading that. And thank you for our youth volunteers that met early this morning to take care of

7
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.770
our youth and to build that ministry as we gear up for the fall. And well, we have a wonderful

8
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.710
gathering planned for you today. We are gonna continue with our series getting there and today we're

9
00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:18.380
gonna be talking it with about um a topic that I feel is gonna be so relevant to all of us. It's

10
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:25.299
gonna be uh titled uh Sweet Water In the Shade and you'll hear more about that later on. After our

11
00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:30.419
time of worship, we're gonna finish sing a few songs together. And it's an opportunity for us to

12
00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:37.419
just kind of like, forget about our problems and just put our life in God's hands just to focus on

13
00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:43.510
him and stop allowing for the doubt and the distractions of this life to just invade our minds and

14
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.500
hearts and to keep us away from a new experience with God and what he would have to reveal to us and

15
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.859
help us to experience today. And so I want to invite you to just stand as you would sing a few songs

16
00:10:55.869 --> 00:11:01.630
together with the team and that you would sing with all of your heart that you would just sometimes

17
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:08.210
sing the words that are even a challenge to believe in because of what you're going through.

18
00:11:08.349 --> 00:11:14.929
Sometimes the, the words that we sing are, are, are hard for us to even believe because our

19
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:23.669
experience is so different. But God is here to remind us that as we worship Him, we are reminding

20
00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:31.780
ourselves of His promises and we're dispelling the doubt in favor of His faith and believing that

21
00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:38.409
His hand of blessing is still upon us. You believe that for yourself today, that God's favor is on

22
00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:45.880
you, that He loves you and that He wants to do something powerful in and through you. And so sink

23
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:53.580
that, believe that and let's be changed and transformed by that together. And so father, as we are

24
00:11:53.590 --> 00:12:01.830
brought into a relationship with you, your faith through hope. And with love. I pray that today

25
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.799
would be a new day for all of us that you would strengthen us and give us the courage that we need

26
00:12:09.309 --> 00:12:17.979
to step out into the darkness. Knowing that you, the light are shining brightly within us and

27
00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:24.979
through us. And for us, you see the path better than we could ever see it. And I pray that you would

28
00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:32.049
guide us on it and that we would receive the blessings that we would need on the path that you have

29
00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:41.080
lit for us to walk upon. And so today is a day in which we just renounce the enemy and his attacks

30
00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:48.119
where we ask for your forgiveness and we confess it before you and say, Lord, may we become new

31
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:57.210
again in your presence. It's a day in which we can rejoice and reflect on your goodness and find the

32
00:12:57.219 --> 00:13:03.200
very things that we can be grateful for so that we can experience the fullness of everything that

33
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:11.609
you have in store for us. Today is a new day, a day that you have made a day that we will rejoice

34
00:13:11.619 --> 00:13:18.469
you in it in jesus' name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's worship together. Would you welcome the river's

35
00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:19.429
edge worship team?

36
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.599
Good morning, everyone. So before we start our worship today, I'd love for us to read was

37
00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:35.210
from revelation chapter four and verse 11. If you could put that on, please,

38
00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:46.510
OK. So if we could all read this together says you are worthy our Lord and God to receive glory and

39
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.960
honor and power for you created all things and by your will, they were created and have their being.

40
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:59.690
Um Even as we sing the song, let's ascribe glory and honor and power to our God who's worthy, who's

41
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:06.179
worthy of everything. Um For He has created us and we've been created to worship. So let's sing this

42
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:06.789
together.

87
00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:16.300
Wow. Thank you worship team. That was amazing.

88
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:25.040
I just want to share some quick announcements with you before we transition to the message. And uh

89
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:30.300
so good to see you guys here today and to be a part of this gathering together and I would just want

90
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:37.709
to share with you that at 10 a.m. is when our youth meeting uh takes place. So every Sunday, our

91
00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:42.780
youth class meets at 10 o'clock. So to all the parents that are here to those of you that know uh

92
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:49.930
teenagers and want to get them connected to our community of faith. Uh We have the youth that meet

93
00:30:49.939 --> 00:30:57.670
in the annex every Sunday at 10 a.m. We have great teachers and great teaching. It's interactive and

94
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:05.500
uh and even the kids get to as well share. And so it's gonna be something that we are doing now

95
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:10.910
throughout the summer as we ramp up towards the fall in the same manner that we're also offering the

96
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:18.500
kids worship at 10 30. And we have been preparing our worship team to lead worship and our teachers

97
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.760
and getting them ready uh to do this each and every week. And they've been doing a phenomenal job

98
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:32.030
already teaching the kids new songs and some old songs as well that are new. Most likely to them.

99
00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:37.780
But to us that we may have heard them when we were little, we were getting a chance to teach it to

100
00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:43.760
them. And then at some point, we're going to see the kids on stage, uh just sharing those songs with

101
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:50.170
us. And so that's what we're doing right now. Um at 10 30. So if there's any kids in the auditorium,

102
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.589
we wanna just uh encourage you to get them into the classrooms. Uh As soon as you come into to the

103
00:31:55.599 --> 00:32:02.160
church when you drop them off. Uh First thing when you come to Rivers Edge, we have a women's event.

104
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:09.530
It's our girls ministry. It's for women of all ages and it happens August the 26th. This is gonna be

105
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:15.420
the next event. It's gonna happen at 10 a.m. There's gonna be a teaching on rehab. Um And then

106
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:22.209
there's also going to be tea and scones and worship and if you miss the first one, you know that you

107
00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:28.430
miss something incredible. So you really want to make it out to the next one as um this was an

108
00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:35.089
incredible event. And so it's gonna be a continuation of the unlikely royalty, women in the Bible

109
00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:42.810
who led up to the genealogy of Jesus. And so you're gonna be learning about uh rehab on August the

110
00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:49.560
26th. And then the next event is going to be for the men. It's the guys ministry and there's a

111
00:32:49.569 --> 00:32:55.219
camping trip and that camping trip is actually taking place on a Friday night and Saturday, it's

112
00:32:55.229 --> 00:33:03.050
gonna be taking place on someone's property in Wentworth North and we're gonna have, uh, a special

113
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:09.420
speaker come in for that event. Um, there's gonna be a barbecue, there's ax throwing, not at each

114
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:15.849
other but at Targets. And there's a bunch of things that, that are planned for that day. And so, um,

115
00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:20.280
it's gonna be a Friday night and a Saturday. And so we want to invite all the men to just take a

116
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.000
note of that and then to sign up for it in the weeks to come and we're just letting you know about

117
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:32.819
it now. Uh I think we've already have uh somewhere around uh 40 names signed up for this event. Um

118
00:33:32.829 --> 00:33:34.609
It's a great thing. So,

119
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:42.069
and it's gonna be a great time for us to get to know each other and I'll be there along with our

120
00:33:42.079 --> 00:33:47.630
men's ministry leaders and, and others. And so it's gonna be a great opportunity for the guys of

121
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.369
this church just to hang out if you can. That's the weekend to do it. And so we encourage you for

122
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:58.209
that. And then we have four ways to give. Thank you for your generosity. We've really seen um um

123
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:02.810
just the faithfulness of our, of our community that even though it's in the summer months, we've

124
00:34:02.819 --> 00:34:08.719
seen how you've been consistent in your giving. And uh we have several ways that you can give So

125
00:34:08.729 --> 00:34:14.030
even if you're not here, you can always use one of the apps. Um, e transfer is the best because it

126
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.500
doesn't take a fee and we get the full donation amount, but whatever it is, that's convenient for

127
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:24.909
you, um, all the donations are tax receivable. And so there's these envelopes and a lot of people

128
00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:29.919
don't know. So I'm just gonna take a moment just to share this. Um, there's envelopes at the giving

129
00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:36.110
kiosks and what those envelopes are for is for you to put down your name and your address. And then

130
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:42.389
whenever you make a contribution in person here at the P OS machine or just for us to be able to

131
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:49.229
give you a tax receipt, uh You need to take a copy of that donation, put it in the envelope and, and

132
00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:54.560
keep your copy. So there's always two copies that are printed and then we get to give you a tax

133
00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:00.050
receipt. Now, the why, why a tax receipt? Well, um the Canadian government knows how important

134
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:05.159
charities are and nonprofit organizations like ours are and the work that we do in the community.

135
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:13.459
And so it will give you then 50% back up to 50% back of your donation. So not only do you give to

136
00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:19.899
Rivers Edge, but then you get 50% of that back. It's a taxable benefit to you and one that also

137
00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:26.159
encourages giving to places like us. So just in case you didn't know. And if you did, well, you're

138
00:35:26.169 --> 00:35:31.699
not that much smarter. I'm sorry. Uh I, hopefully it'll get you smarter in the scriptures in a

139
00:35:31.709 --> 00:35:38.179
moment, but that's all I have to offer for now. Um, and let's now transition uh for the bumper and

140
00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:41.500
we're gonna get into the message, sweet water in the shade.

141
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:35.250
We think of summer, we think of the sun, we think of something refreshing, something that we can

142
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:42.489
just be out there and enjoy. Um Just the beautiful weather that we're experiencing, except if you're

143
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.000
in Montreal and it's raining every 15 minutes. Has anybody else notice that. It's not ridiculous. I

144
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:54.260
don't know what's happening, but it's like raining all the time. And I, I just wanted to title this

145
00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:00.080
message appropriately because of the topic that we're in. And we're talking about God getting us

146
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:06.129
there wherever that is for us individually, but he has promises that He's made. He made promises to

147
00:37:06.139 --> 00:37:11.784
His people and those promises are also really for us as well. And there's a journey that they've

148
00:37:11.794 --> 00:37:17.534
been on these Israelites as they've left Egypt and are headed towards king and their promised land.

149
00:37:17.544 --> 00:37:23.125
But there's still so much to go through so many challenges and obstacles and battles to be fought

150
00:37:23.135 --> 00:37:29.260
both internally and even externally. And I think we all can resonate with that, but God made a

151
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:34.739
promise to get them there. And I believe he's made that same promise to each of us He will get us to

152
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:44.889
where he said, the Bible says that he began a work in us that He promises to bring to completion,

153
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:53.520
that He promises to fulfill. And so this, this aspirational hope that we may have about us getting

154
00:37:53.530 --> 00:38:00.100
there is really on God's part, a promise. And when we have our doubts, just like the Israelites, and

155
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:06.219
then we complain and we grumble and then we find ourselves wandering and living out our life through

156
00:38:06.229 --> 00:38:12.959
the many detours that we can sometimes experience by our own hand. And that of others. God still

157
00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:20.010
promises to get us there. The passage that we're in is a beautiful one. And you may not be entirely

158
00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:25.580
familiar with it, but it's just one of those beautiful passages that has the ability to speak to us

159
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:34.489
about not only the past but also the future and in Exodus 15, it's at verse 22 that we begin to read

160
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:41.010
and it says that then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea and they moved out into

161
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:50.639
the desert of Sh and they traveled in this desert for three days without finding any water. And when

162
00:38:50.649 --> 00:38:58.699
they came to this oasis called Marra, the water was too bitter to drink. And so they are the ones

163
00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:07.729
who called it, this which means bitter. And then the people complained and they turned against Moses

164
00:39:08.419 --> 00:39:12.879
and they said, what are we going to drink? They demanded. And so Moses cried out to the Lord for

165
00:39:12.889 --> 00:39:23.020
help and the Lord showed him a piece of wood and Moses picked up the wood and he threw it into the

166
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:32.219
water and this made the water that was bitter, good to drink. And it was there at matter that the

167
00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:43.020
Lord set before them. The following decree, God here makes a covenant. He sets a standard to test

168
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:49.429
their faithfulness to him. And he says this to them. He says that if you will listen carefully to

169
00:39:49.439 --> 00:39:58.639
the voice of the Lord, your God and you do what is right in his sight, obeying his commands and

170
00:39:58.649 --> 00:40:10.320
keeping all his decrees, then I will not make you suffer any of the diseases that I sent on the

171
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.320
Egyptians for I am the Lord who heals you.

172
00:40:18.699 --> 00:40:25.360
And after leaving Marra, the Israelites traveled to the oasis of Ali

173
00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:40.780
and means um it's, it stands out and points to God and there they found 12 springs and there were 70

174
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:51.179
palm trees and then they camped there beside the water. Now, the first thing that these Israelites

175
00:40:51.189 --> 00:40:59.610
encounter out of the Red Sea is bitter waters. And I don't know if you've ever left something really

176
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:05.870
bad for you but bad. Like in the most tragic sense, it's kind of like you just left that behind.

177
00:41:05.879 --> 00:41:11.310
It's in your rear view mirror, you've taken steps to just live a new life to be a new person. And,

178
00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:21.169
and instead of finding refreshment sweet waters in the shade. You find bitter waters in the desert.

179
00:41:22.959 --> 00:41:28.629
It's like you just had the most miraculous encounter where God just showed you powerfully who he is

180
00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:33.330
and he's revealed himself that way in your life. And you believe in Him, you take the steps to go

181
00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:38.850
and follow him and he leads you to where you think is the promise. But instead he leads you to

182
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:46.500
waters that are bitter. Some of us in this room like bitter things. Some of us suck on lemons like

183
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:54.370
for fun. Anybody out there do that, you just love the, the tardiness and the and the shock of it,

184
00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:59.520
you like you just like it. Uh But when we talk about something that is, that is bitter, it means

185
00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:11.199
that it has really no redeemable trace left in it. It means that even if you have a high tolerance

186
00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.070
and low standards

187
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:23.100
that even for you, this water would be undrinkable and, and, and so it, it, it gets its name bitter

188
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:31.110
waters because no one can drink from it. Even people who say like I can pretty much drink anything

189
00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:37.080
even they rejected this water. And, and I think that sometimes that's what life is like in our

190
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:45.909
spiritual journey. We God leads us to a place where we outright reject where we are. It is so bitter,

191
00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:55.419
there is no redeemable quality to it. We cannot in any way imagine that God is still with us. If

192
00:42:55.429 --> 00:42:59.260
this is where He has led us and this is what we have to drink.

193
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.520
And so you complain

194
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:09.820
and you complain because it's been three days now that you have traveled without water.

195
00:43:13.229 --> 00:43:18.959
And three days means that your body is shutting down three days means is that your body is, is

196
00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:23.840
pretty much preparing itself for the eventuality, which is, which is death.

197
00:43:26.659 --> 00:43:35.699
And so when you're dying and you're trusting God who just delivered you from the worst possible life

198
00:43:35.709 --> 00:43:41.840
that you've ever lived for generations now. And the place He leads you to is bitter waters, you can

199
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:46.739
understand why you'd be a little upset with God in this moment.

200
00:43:49.189 --> 00:43:50.100
Have you been there?

201
00:43:52.939 --> 00:43:53.830
Are you there? Now?

202
00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:03.889
You're having a hard time with Him. You see in this story though, after God tells Moses to do

203
00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:11.979
something very unusual, um, we already know He has a staff and he could have taken that staff and he

204
00:44:11.989 --> 00:44:16.229
could have touched the waters with it and, and made it good in the same way that he could have

205
00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:21.840
parted the waters. He could have made the water sweet. But there was something different about this

206
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:27.080
moment in a moment in which God says, take this random piece of wood, take that and put that in the

207
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:34.459
water instead. And it just goes to show you that any time and every time you think, you know how God

208
00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:37.399
is gonna work, he's ready to surprise you again,

209
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.159
that the way that you think he did, it is the way that you think he's going to do it again. That's

210
00:44:44.169 --> 00:44:51.949
not how God works. And the very thing that you would disregard as being useless along with the water

211
00:44:51.959 --> 00:44:59.280
that you're in front of God says, not only can this water be useful, but when I ask you to do

212
00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:09.830
something and you do it and you act in obedience to that, which is unusual and seemingly ridiculous.

213
00:45:11.479 --> 00:45:23.179
I can make bitter waters sweet again with that which is just around you. And the difference is you

214
00:45:23.189 --> 00:45:34.239
obeying me when I tell you that this can be used to turn those bitter waters sweet. And so it makes

215
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:41.280
me think God, what is around me every day that I'm just disregarding, what is it that is right in

216
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:47.090
front of me that can save my life. But I have already determined that it's bitter and it has no use

217
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:53.540
to me that I have to leave this area for another area. Instead of realizing that what's in front of

218
00:45:53.550 --> 00:46:00.100
me is something that you can still redeem something that you can turn from bitter to sweet and you

219
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:09.330
can use the most unusual thing to do it. II I think that when people think of the wood that takes

220
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:18.070
away the bitter, it makes me think of the cross on which Jesus was hung, it speaks to the bitterness

221
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.120
of this world and the bitterness of our life. And the bitterness of what we've been through and gone

222
00:46:23.129 --> 00:46:28.570
through and are going through and, and how that bitterness can also bring about the covenant that

223
00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:34.129
God made with His people. At this moment, when he said to them, if you would obey me, I would make

224
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:39.729
sure that no disease would touch you just like it touched the Egyptians. I will make sure that this

225
00:46:39.739 --> 00:46:45.479
disease never touches you because I will show you that through this wood that makes the bitter

226
00:46:45.489 --> 00:46:57.699
waters sweet. That this wood can also become not a burden, not a curse, but your deliverance. When

227
00:46:57.709 --> 00:47:06.159
Jesus one day will be hung on it. See, Jesus is, is always present in every story and in this story,

228
00:47:06.169 --> 00:47:11.989
he's just this random piece of wood that people thought they could conquer Him with that. They

229
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.330
thought they could execute him with that. They thought they could disgrace him with that. They

230
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:26.570
thought they could kill the movement of the way with. They thought they could end Christianity with

231
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:35.250
it, but all it did was empower it. It took the most bitter moment and it turned it into the sweetest.

232
00:47:36.379 --> 00:47:45.229
You see, God is saying the only way to truly heal is through Jesus and the cross. The only way that

233
00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:52.729
the bitter waters will be made sweet. And and, and why do I say this? I say this? Because on this

234
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:59.780
journey that they were in, not only did God turn the water sweet, that was bitter. But then he led

235
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:03.899
them to a oasis called

236
00:48:05.939 --> 00:48:14.860
and this oasis didn't exist before God created it out of nothing. He made an oasis in the desert

237
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:21.649
where there wasn't one before. How do we know this? Because it's too specific to what he created

238
00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:34.510
there? It says very clearly that what he did, there was 12 springs, 12 wells of water, 12 wells for

239
00:48:34.639 --> 00:48:48.439
the people and 70 palms, not 71 not 72 but 70. And when God is this specific, with his numbers, his

240
00:48:48.449 --> 00:48:55.709
numbers mean something and they are repeated throughout the scriptures. And we know that there are

241
00:48:55.719 --> 00:49:04.310
12 tribes of Israel. We know that there were 12 disciples. We know that Jesus told his disciples

242
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:12.560
that they would one day judge the 12 tribes. The 70 is also significant. It appears over and over

243
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:20.110
again. And when the burden was too heavy on Moses to lead thousands of people, Jethro shows up and

244
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:26.729
he says, Moses from morning to evening, day after day, you keep judging over the matters of your

245
00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:35.290
people. You cannot continue like this, but appoint some over 10 and appoint others over 50 100 and

246
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:43.850
1000 and, and choose your leaders from among the people that you have. And so Moses chose 70 elders,

247
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:55.570
70 leaders. And so what we see is that there's 12 springs of water and there's 12 tribes of Israel,

248
00:49:55.739 --> 00:50:03.229
there's 70 palm trees because there's 70 leaders that have been appointed by Moses. But there's

249
00:50:03.239 --> 00:50:09.250
something else, something that God wanted to show them that he was always able to redeem. And that

250
00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:17.830
was that when Jacob left his land to meet his son Joseph, who he thought was dead and his brothers

251
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:25.870
had already met him in Egypt and where Joseph had become the leader in Egypt and he was able to give

252
00:50:25.879 --> 00:50:37.020
his family refuge from the famine. The Bible tells us that Jacob showed up with 70 from his house

253
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:46.939
and then from being in Egypt, the 70 continued to multiply until they became so numerous and so

254
00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:54.129
blessed that the Egyptians began to hate them and then put them into slavery. So what God does is he

255
00:50:54.139 --> 00:51:02.270
says, remember the 70 that came with Jacob that were from his house. Well, now I'm showing you that

256
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:10.679
there are 70 palms. That amazing what God does is that He reveals that through the numbers, there's

257
00:51:10.689 --> 00:51:18.899
so much involved in it. There's a story in the Scriptures in Luke chapter 10 where it says that 70

258
00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.879
were sent out by Jesus,

259
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:29.979
70 disciples had to go to the places where Jesus had not yet gone.

260
00:51:32.469 --> 00:51:39.840
And in Luke chapter 10, in verse one, it says after these things, the Lord appointed 70 others and

261
00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:46.550
he sent them two by two before his face into every city and every place where he himself was about

262
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.129
to go. Now, why is this important? Why the 12? Why the 70

263
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:59.939
it's because God remembers every step of everyone's journey, including yours.

264
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.139
Every step is remembered.

265
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.719
There are things about my journey that I, that I forgot.

266
00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:23.879
There are things about my journey that I remember wrongly. Did you ever have a conversation with

267
00:52:23.889 --> 00:52:30.129
someone who is with you? And you've got the facts a little mixed up and you're like, no, that's not

268
00:52:30.139 --> 00:52:35.679
how I remember it. And you think it's a perspective thing. No, you just got them wrong like they're

269
00:52:35.689 --> 00:52:40.810
getting it right. You're, you're just remembering it wrong. We can't trust our memories like that.

270
00:52:40.919 --> 00:52:46.520
Sometimes we just want uh forget things, right? Just leave them behind and never think about them,

271
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:51.909
talk about them. And that's why we cut not just events but people out of our lives because they are

272
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:59.570
reminders of those things. But here's someone who never forgets every step of our journey is

273
00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:11.729
remembered by God. The good and the bad, the bitter and the sweet. But do you believe in a God today?

274
00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:20.350
Who remembers every part of your journey? But who can turn the bitter into sweet? See, I think

275
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.649
that's where we're gonna struggle a little bit in the room.

276
00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:33.040
We're gonna look at situations and we're gonna say these bitter waters can never become sweet. But

277
00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:43.129
you see, that's what God means when he says I can take all things, all things and turn them into

278
00:53:43.139 --> 00:53:52.060
good for your life. And I, I may struggle with that when I think of what the bitterness is, but

279
00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:59.909
that's where you have to trust God for it. You have to believe that God can do what he did at Mara.

280
00:53:59.919 --> 00:54:06.590
He can do that in your own life. And that if He performed a miracle for you to see the parting of

281
00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:12.899
the seas before you so that you could walk on dry land and have an encounter with God. He can do the

282
00:54:12.909 --> 00:54:19.149
next thing in your life, which is take whatever is bitter and turn it into something sweet. But

283
00:54:19.159 --> 00:54:24.520
you're gonna have to trust Him and obey him in that process. And he may tell you to take something

284
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:29.989
like a piece of wood that looks like it has no purpose and no use. And it's just a random thing left

285
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.550
over from another life

286
00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:40.090
when it had use, when it had purpose, when it had significance and when it had meaning, and God

287
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:47.179
could reuse that. And as you turn towards those bitter waters and you, you obey God and He tells you

288
00:54:47.189 --> 00:54:53.739
take it and just throw it into the bitter waters and you do it, then you can experience the miracle

289
00:54:53.939 --> 00:55:03.280
of the bitter waters being turned sweet in your life. I want you to have that. I want you to have

290
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:13.989
that belief. I can't create that within you. But I believe that the Holy Spirit can and I believe

291
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.020
that he's doing that right now by telling us this story and scriptures. Remind us of how beautiful

292
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:26.169
this is. Because in Psalms 30 verse five, it says for his anger, look at this. It lasts only a

293
00:55:26.179 --> 00:55:34.939
moment, but his favor will always last. A lifetime. Weeping may last through the night. But he says,

294
00:55:34.949 --> 00:55:42.250
joy comes with the morning. He's telling you that no matter what was bitter, he can make it sweet,

295
00:55:43.979 --> 00:55:53.489
the bitter waters can become sweet water, not having any shade can turn into 70 palms. And for

296
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:59.840
whoever it is, that's a part of his tribe for that are a part of his people. He's got springs of

297
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:09.979
living water available to you in the oasis, in the desert that He can spring and make a life out of

298
00:56:09.989 --> 00:56:12.149
nothing. He can do that for you.

299
00:56:14.639 --> 00:56:22.479
And he says, then I want you to make camp by the water. I want you to make camp by that shade. I

300
00:56:22.489 --> 00:56:28.459
want you to make camp by those, by those springs. And I want you to enjoy what it is that I've

301
00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:35.770
brought into your life. And there was everything that they needed for that moment and remember how

302
00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:42.679
they were complaining and grumbling. How were they? They were distrusting. And then we in disbelief

303
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:49.600
that God could lead them out because they had been without water for three days. And the first thing

304
00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:55.570
they meant were bitter waters. Well, now God has completely revolutionized their thinking. Their

305
00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.500
thinking is no longer the same. He showed them I can take bitter waters and make them sweet. But

306
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:11.159
more than that I can give you springs of living water. I can give you palm trees with dates on them

307
00:57:11.449 --> 00:57:19.479
to nourish you and all the people for days to come and he's showing them that not only is the water

308
00:57:19.489 --> 00:57:27.340
sweet, but the palms provide them with that, which is sweet as well. See God is, is in our life to

309
00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:33.520
show us that when, when life has made us bitter, when the the circumstances of our life has have

310
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:40.580
shown us and revealed that it's only bitterness. He can take that, turn it around and say, I can

311
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:47.800
make this sweet for you. Will you trust in Jesus who was put on the cross? Will you go to him and

312
00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:55.770
say, Lord, will you be that word that goes and makes all that is bittersweet. Will you turn my

313
00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:03.560
attention to you and to what it means to put my faith and trust in you and to know that you are that

314
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:10.850
living water and that you are the shade that I need in the scorching sun that you are the oasis in

315
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:18.290
the desert, the place of rest so that I can be prepared for the next season of my life. I want you

316
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:23.780
to name the bitter water in your life right now. I want you to name the bitter water that is in your

317
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:24.570
past.

318
00:58:27.229 --> 00:58:29.850
I want you to name the bitter water that is in your present.

319
00:58:32.419 --> 00:58:42.429
And now I want you to declare over that water in Jesus name, you will be made sweet. I will be able

320
00:58:42.439 --> 00:58:47.479
to drink from this bar of water. I will be able to celebrate your name

321
00:58:49.760 --> 00:59:00.419
because this is the day in which I can rejoice. It's no longer a time of tears and weeping. It's no

322
00:59:00.429 --> 00:59:09.110
longer a time of anger. It's no longer a season of disbelief. It's no longer about that. I wanna

323
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:16.570
believe in your favor that lasts a lifetime. I am no longer going to weep over these bitter waters.

324
00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:25.530
I am going to believe in the joy that comes in the morning. I am not gonna allow this moment to keep

325
00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:34.179
robbing me of the oasis. That is ahead. You see if, if you get stuck at Mara, you don't get to

326
00:59:34.189 --> 00:59:35.110
experience a

327
00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:46.399
and many of us never got to experience El, we never got to experience the 12 springs of living water.

328
00:59:46.409 --> 00:59:53.040
We never got to experience the palm trees, the 70 palms. We never got to experience that because we

329
00:59:53.050 --> 01:00:01.879
just got stuck at the bitter waters of Mara. Do you see how that can hold you back? God is saying,

330
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:10.679
don't let anything have power and authority like that over. You don't let anything have that kind of

331
01:00:10.689 --> 01:00:12.750
mastery over your past.

332
01:00:15.429 --> 01:00:20.340
Maybe your bitter waters were in your household. Maybe they were in a relationship, maybe they were

333
01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:28.219
through a friendship, maybe they were through the most unexpected of ways. Maybe they came in the

334
01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:34.090
form of tragedy in some form of trauma. But I want you to understand that whatever the bitter waters

335
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:39.000
are, don't get stuck there when God

336
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:49.219
can turn them sweet. So you can keep going to your oasis. Don't you want the oasis in your life?

337
01:00:50.449 --> 01:00:52.780
Aren't you? Aren't you done with the bidder

338
01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:02.639
done with being stuck with the past and the present that keeps telling you that this isn't going to

339
01:01:02.649 --> 01:01:09.459
work, that you're not gonna make it, that you're not under God's favor, that you're not blessed by

340
01:01:09.469 --> 01:01:18.409
Him that nothing good was gonna come after this. Stop believing that when God has made promises to

341
01:01:18.419 --> 01:01:25.310
the contrary and he's ready to fulfill them in your life, are you ready to pray with me for that and

342
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.659
receive that in your life?

343
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:35.169
Would you stand as we would pray together? Father? I want to thank you for every person here who has

344
01:01:35.179 --> 01:01:42.439
thought of a bitter moment in their life who has been challenged by the course of this story that

345
01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:49.679
the Israelites lived and how it it resonated with us about our own story. I can think of so many

346
01:01:49.689 --> 01:01:56.879
instances in my own life where I've been stuck at the bitter waters of the past. Lord, I pray in

347
01:01:56.889 --> 01:02:02.169
jesus' name that we would all just be freed from the bitter waters that you would make them sweet

348
01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:04.770
for us, that we would turn to Jesus who could touch them?

349
01:02:07.209 --> 01:02:14.979
Lord. Lord, would you stir those waters and bring the healing covenant into our lives? You promised

350
01:02:14.989 --> 01:02:22.570
that you would heal the Israelites that they would never be sick like they were like they had

351
01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:28.350
witnessed in Egypt, the Egyptians facing the plagues. You said that you would protect them from that?

352
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:36.219
Lord. I know that there's some people here today that need your healing. That is their bitter water.

353
01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.010
They have disease in their body. They have an illness that they've been battling there. There's a

354
01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:48.370
sickness that they have been struggling with. I wanna pray in Jesus name right now for them, that

355
01:02:48.379 --> 01:02:56.699
their bitter waters would be become sweet, that you would heal them and deliver them just like you

356
01:02:56.709 --> 01:03:03.889
made the covenant to your people. Then I know that covenant still stands because when Jesus went to

357
01:03:03.899 --> 01:03:10.250
the cross, he took every illness and he had made sure that it was crucified and left there on the

358
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:18.850
cross. You are our healer. You are our deliverer. You are the one who takes all that is bitter and

359
01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:27.820
makes it sweet. You're the one who takes all that is bad and turns it into good and for our good.

360
01:03:28.209 --> 01:03:33.820
And I pray that you would do that for all of us today. Thank you for the victory that you're giving

361
01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:47.489
us so that we no longer are held hostage to the things that make us believe that life is bitter and

362
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:57.239
we pray that when we would rise up tomorrow morning, that we would experience the joy that you have

363
01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:06.070
promised to the Psalms and to the psalmists that you promised to your people and that you've

364
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:16.800
promised to us, we believe in the joy that comes in the morning in Jesus name. We pray. Amen. Amen.

365
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:21.310
God bless you guys. I hope that encourages you and helps you in your spiritual journey. And we're

366
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.870
gonna sing, oh, Thank you so kind.

367
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.939
We're gonna sing this song together and I pray that it's a moment in which we can just release that

368
01:04:31.949 --> 01:04:38.199
bitterness. I know it may take more than just a moment in our, in our gathering and more than just a

369
01:04:38.209 --> 01:04:46.870
few minutes in this song, it may take a few minutes in the days and in the weeks to come for us to

370
01:04:46.879 --> 01:04:52.419
be set free from the bitterness. But I believe that if you keep turning to God, keep turning to

371
01:04:52.429 --> 01:04:58.250
Jesus, he will do it. He will accomplish, keep trusting Him for this victory, keep believing and

372
01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:04.010
asking him for it. And you'll see that it will happen. It'll come to the moment where the most

373
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:10.120
bitter moment in your life, you'll be able to look back on it and it will no longer feel the same

374
01:05:10.129 --> 01:05:16.219
way. It will no longer have the same hold, it will no longer affect you in the same manner. It will

375
01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:22.070
no longer have that authority over your life because God will have turned that which is bitter into

376
01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:28.090
sweet. Do you want to believe that for yourself? Not just today, but every day and just keep

377
01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:35.120
reminding yourself of his truth and his promise. And so let that happen today, let it begin now, but

378
01:05:35.129 --> 01:05:40.120
let it continue even after the now, God bless you. Let's sing this song together.

379
01:05:44.199 --> 01:05:48.689
We're all trying to figure out how we can turn our lives around and make that, that transition from

380
01:05:48.699 --> 01:05:54.110
bitter to sweet. And one way to do that, at least for me that I'm learning is just a party through

381
01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:00.770
it. It sounds a little counterintuitive, but it says in scripture um will exalt the Lord at all

382
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:06.409
times. His praise will always be on our lips, on, on our lips. Give thanks without ceasing pray

383
01:06:06.419 --> 01:06:11.889
praise. And so we're gonna teach this song to you guys. It's gonna require some participation. So

384
01:06:12.409 --> 01:06:19.580
just follow along with us if that's cool with you, start with some claps. 12341.

406
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:14.870
and some cookies. So enjoy some juice and lemonade and some cannolis. Happy summer.
