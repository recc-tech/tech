00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.470
Well, good morning and welcome to Rivers Edge. It's so great to have you with us today. Are you

2
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.410
excited to be here? Excited to have you? It's gonna be a great Sunday. We have so much in store for

3
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:47.920
you and we are here to remind you that our youth ministry starts at 10 a.m. and our kids ministry

4
00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:55.140
starts at 10 30. And so we are glad that we have kids that we can meet the needs of and youth as

5
00:06:55.149 --> 00:07:00.450
well. And we just thank our teams for being able to do that today. And we just want to say hello to

6
00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:07.190
all those that are on our online ministry. Everybody that's a part of Facebook live and on youtube

7
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.209
right now as well as Vimeo and on the website, just welcome. You're a part of this as well. And

8
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.489
we're so glad that you are here with us at River's Edge. But we have a wonderful gathering planned

9
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.529
for you today. We're gonna be talking about turning points and as we just watched in the video just

10
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.570
a few moments ago, sometimes we mourn dreams that are lost. But what God does is that he reminds us

11
00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:38.670
that we can always be open to God size dreams. Instead that when things don't go the way that we

12
00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:45.790
planned, that He has a plan for us still. And so today is a day in which we can turn our attention

13
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:53.350
to God and experience a turning point in our life. And today, we're gonna hear a message about the

14
00:07:53.359 --> 00:08:00.489
God of inheritance and we'll hear more about what that means as we continue today. But I'm gonna

15
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.209
invite you to stand with me as we would open in a word of prayer. And I want to encourage you today

16
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:13.429
that, that you are on a spiritual journey that God is directing, that He is filling with faith, love

17
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.750
and hope every step of the way. And he's gonna keep reminding you of His faithfulness and of how you

18
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.519
can trust Him in all things and in all areas of your life. And so right now, we just want to put

19
00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:33.429
away all distractions and we want to set aside all discouragement. We wanna let go of our own dreams

20
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.880
for God's dreams, for us. And we wanna just do that as we pray. Father. Thank you for every person

21
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:45.549
that is here, for everyone that is watching for everyone that is experiencing this. And I pray that

22
00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:51.130
this would be a day in which you would be honored and glorified and that we would be ministered to

23
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:58.159
and blessed that our lives would be empowered and enriched. As we trust you for the next steps in

24
00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:04.340
our own life. Thank you for the way that you've got our back for the way that you before us. Thank

25
00:09:04.349 --> 00:09:11.140
you for the way that you are leading us into the promises and that you are indeed the God of

26
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:17.659
inheritance. And I pray that today would be a day that we would rejoice and rejoice loudly that we

27
00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:26.159
would be free to be able to understand that today and every day belongs to you that you are the

28
00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:33.960
final authority on all things. And we pray these things in jesus' name. Amen. Would you welcome the

29
00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:36.440
River's edge worship team as we worship together today?

30
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:51.640
Amen. Good morning. Everyone. Let's prepare our hearts to receive from God but also to celebrate

31
00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:56.760
with this first song as we sing about his amazing grace.

87
00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.500
Before we sing this next song. We got to read a word from Revelation 4 11 together.

88
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:10.989
So can we, we read it together please that says you are worthy our Lord and God to receive glory and

89
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.069
honor and power for you created all things and by your will, they were created and have their being.

90
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:24.170
Our God is worthy of all glory, honor and power. No matter what it is that you're going through

91
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:30.989
today. Let's bring it to the foot of His cross and leave it there and forget about, forget about

92
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.130
everything, knowing that God looks out for us and loves us. So let's sing this together

110
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.430
You may be seated.

111
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.790
The word of wisdom that God gave me, that changed the game for me when I actually listened to it was

112
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.319
that he sees me like he sees my heart, he sees my motives. He sees my intentions. He sees my

113
00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:20.910
experience, he sees what I walked through, he sees what I'm facing and what I'm dealing with and he

114
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:27.560
cares and if my pain matters to me, it matters to him and that gave me peace because I realized my

115
00:26:27.569 --> 00:26:32.479
pain matters to him. I don't have to go to other people to get them to see my pain. I don't have to

116
00:26:32.489 --> 00:26:38.569
get them to understand me like he sees me and he cares deeply for me. And um you know, he's going to

117
00:26:38.579 --> 00:26:43.229
fight for me and he told me that he said you are worth fighting for, you don't have to fight for

118
00:26:43.239 --> 00:26:47.939
yourself. Like I'm going to be the one to fight for you. You will not have to do a thing. And I was

119
00:26:47.949 --> 00:26:52.369
able to just rest in that like I don't have to stand up and fight. I can just sit down and be still

120
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.670
and trust.

121
00:27:01.969 --> 00:27:06.849
that was Christina giving her testimony, but a turning point in her life. And I know that we all

122
00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:11.670
have a turning point. And I think that when we're trying to look back and understand what God is

123
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.839
doing in our lives, we can see moments where God has been extremely evident and faithful. And there

124
00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:25.040
are stories that we can all tell. And I believe that there are key turning points just like in the

125
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:32.219
scriptures, there are key turning points. There are moments that really changed everything. And this

126
00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:39.180
is one of those times where we're going to be looking at a particular story that speaks to us about

127
00:27:39.189 --> 00:27:48.750
the God of inheritance. There's a story in which there was a king by the name of a and he needed to

128
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:59.579
pick a wife and he looked throughout his kingdom and finally he settled on another kingdom. And on

129
00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:09.939
this day, he met a beautiful woman who he considered to be his bride, even though the instruction

130
00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:18.969
was clear that he was not to take this woman as his wife. He did it anyways. And in first kings, in

131
00:28:18.979 --> 00:28:30.780
chapter 16, and in verse 31 it says that he not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of his

132
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:43.319
predecessor, Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel, daughter of Edbaal King of the and he

133
00:28:43.329 --> 00:28:53.829
began to serve Baal and worship him. And in this story, we see that he makes this pivotal mistake

134
00:28:54.569 --> 00:29:01.410
one where he defies God and his instructions. He doesn't listen or pay attention to the lessons of

135
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:08.910
his predecessor but continues to walk in the same foolish footsteps. And I think sometimes things

136
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:17.050
can be hard to shake in our lives. It can be hard to distance our lives from the things of the past

137
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:26.380
because they have shaped us and they have informed us and are still shaping our decisions in the

138
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:35.260
present and creating the wrong futures for us. Not even realizing sometimes the things that we hate

139
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.989
the most are the things that we end up doing,

140
00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:46.920
hate the people that may have had a negative influence on our lives. And yet we find ourselves

141
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:55.209
walking in their footsteps, hate the way that they did things and then find ourselves living our

142
00:29:55.219 --> 00:30:02.609
lives in a similar manner. And I know that we can all relate to this because it seems sometimes that

143
00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:11.150
things tend to carry over from generation to generation. Unless there's a turning point, unless

144
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:20.170
there's an end to it, there's a break from it so that something new can take place. And in the story

145
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:28.420
in which we're in, we can see how Ahab and Jezebel just turned the kingdom of Israel completely

146
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:39.579
towards the worship of bail. And this God, this false God is a God that is introduced because of his

147
00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:50.199
marriage. And everyone pays the price and over and over. God tries to give them opportunities to

148
00:30:50.209 --> 00:31:03.469
turn away from this, but they continue to choose otherwise, God keeps telling them turn away, they

149
00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:11.900
don't do it. And so what God does because bail is the God of thunder and rain clouds is that he

150
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.910
shuts the sky and he doesn't allow it to rain.

151
00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:26.739
And he wants them to see that the God that they're praying to and worshiping that they believe is

152
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:34.619
going to give them possession of the land and care for their land and, and care for the future that

153
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:42.359
God is a false God. And God says, I want you to pay attention to the God of your inheritance, the

154
00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:49.560
the the God that has always been the one who gave you this land in the first place and is the one

155
00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:58.290
who truly sends the rain, which is a symbol of God's blessing. And so he shuts the sky and he

156
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:05.650
creates an environment where there's now going to be a showdown between Elijah and all of Bale's

157
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:16.719
prophets. And as the story goes on, they're unable to make it rain. But then when Elijah calls out,

158
00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:27.619
he not only is able to summon fire to consume the sacrifices, but he is also the one who reopens the

159
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:36.040
skies for it to rain again. And he commands the people to then take all of the prophets of bail and

160
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:43.829
put them to death and the people do it but not willingly because they're all still afraid of Ahab

161
00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:54.680
and Jezebel. And so Elijah wants them to do it and they actually end up backing out and then Elijah

162
00:32:54.689 --> 00:33:03.130
has to do it all by himself. And so we then see an Elijah discouraged who runs away and we think,

163
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:10.400
why is he running away? Well, it turns out that then Jezebel puts out a command and in the same way

164
00:33:10.609 --> 00:33:17.130
that all the prophets of her God were killed, she goes out and she gathers up all the prophets of

165
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:23.400
God. Anyone who was teaching the scriptures, anyone who was teaching the people, anyone who had

166
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:31.369
remained faithful to God, she gathers up even more than the number that Elijah had killed and she

167
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:39.380
puts them to death as well. And so after this moment in which God proves to the people and to ahab

168
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:46.250
and even Jezebel that he's the one that they're supposed to follow. No one does. And I wonder if

169
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.550
there's been moments in our own life where there have been turning points. But we have continued to

170
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:58.709
just walk in the same direction where God was trying to get a hold of us and a hold of our attention.

171
00:33:58.719 --> 00:34:03.390
And he was showing us that the direction in which we were going, the things in which we were doing,

172
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:10.938
the way that we were living was wrong for us. But we continued to do it anyways. I, I think that we

173
00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:19.350
can all relate to that. I think that speaks to us in a way that maybe if we're transparent enough

174
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:26.219
today. We can truly identify with that and just say, yeah, I think that's, that's true for me and

175
00:34:26.229 --> 00:34:31.659
it's true in this area of my life where I know it's not the right thing or the best thing or the

176
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:36.590
right thing and it's definitely not gonna lead to an inheritance. I know what I'm doing is

177
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:43.199
squandering it instead of building it up and yet there I am doing it anyways. Can anybody else

178
00:34:43.209 --> 00:34:50.938
relate to that? The struggle within us is, is real, isn't it? It's, it's this battle that is ongoing

179
00:34:50.948 --> 00:34:56.579
and it's not just internal, it's external, it's not just about what we're dealing with, but, but how

180
00:34:56.589 --> 00:35:01.059
we're surrounded. And if you don't bring the right people into your life, what happens is that

181
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:06.678
instead of going towards the inheritance, you keep walking towards losing it.

182
00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:15.489
And so the turning point has to be where we surround ourselves with the right person that we do life

183
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:22.780
with the right people that we select and choose the person that God ultimately is going to bless us

184
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:29.810
and our future with. And God is saying that I can do this in your life so that you can avoid this

185
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:41.560
over and over again. And so God tries to show them this but they don't want to see it. But the story

186
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:51.389
brings us to a turning point in the life of Ahab and Jezebel. And it's the story of a vineyard. You

187
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:57.379
see the story of the vineyard is an interesting one because this is a king who possesses everything,

188
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.969
but he has no inheritance.

189
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.689
And the scriptures tell us that there was a, a vineyard that was beautiful that he could see from

190
00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:15.959
his palace and that he would often gaze upon it and he would just want it for himself. And he wants

191
00:36:15.969 --> 00:36:21.550
to turn it into his own personal garden and it isn't the finest vineyard in the land, but it's just

192
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:29.709
right next to his palace. And he's like, why shouldn't this be mine? And so he goes to Nath and he

193
00:36:29.719 --> 00:36:41.310
says, nath, I'll give you any vineyard in my land that I am. The king of all you have to do is give

194
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:53.989
me your land, just give me that which belonged to your ancestors. And the Bible tells us

195
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
What a whiny king.

196
00:37:53.530 --> 00:38:03.530
But I think that when you have everything you always are unsatisfied and want more, the only thing

197
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:10.020
you can do when you have so much is just think that, well, you can have everything it is that you

198
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:17.989
desire even that which doesn't belong to you. And the scriptures tell us that he wants us to see

199
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:28.389
this difference between the God of inheritance versus the king of possession. And I want you to be

200
00:38:28.399 --> 00:38:34.610
able to understand this difference in your own life. Now, you can be a king and a queen in your life

201
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:40.040
and you can bring whatever possessions you want into it. That is always your choice and it is always

202
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:49.139
going to be of your choosing. You are truly and fully and completely in control of your own kingdom.

203
00:38:49.659 --> 00:38:57.399
Your decisions are constantly driving you to take possessions of things that are either going to

204
00:38:57.409 --> 00:39:07.949
speak about who you are faithful to or what your true inheritance will be. And in the story in which

205
00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:15.280
we're in, Ahab is the kind of king that doesn't really care about any of that other than he just

206
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:26.050
wants what he wants. And there he is in his bedroom, in his pajamas, facing a wall, his face in his

207
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:35.330
pillow, sulking and whining about how he can't have what he wants. I, I don't know, but that reminds

208
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:42.979
me of many days in my own life, many moments where I felt like things were just not going my way

209
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:48.459
where things weren't going, the way that I wanted them to where things didn't turn out the way that

210
00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:58.360
I had expected and anticipated when I was clearly in pursuit of a possession and I could not attain

211
00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:08.760
it. And in those moments, I always lost sight of what should have been my inheritance all along and

212
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:17.169
how I should have been guided and should have been directed in my life with inheritance and not by

213
00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:28.370
possession. This is a story in the gospel of Luke. And it speaks of this passage where Jesus is the

214
00:40:28.379 --> 00:40:40.239
one who says that I'm going to send my son and when I send my son, surely they're going to treat him

215
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:51.750
well because after all, I am the owner of the vineyard. And so Jesus says that the son is sent and

216
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:58.610
they grab him and they mistreat him and they beat him and they eventually kill him and leave his

217
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:07.669
body out in the vineyard. And they do all these things because they want the inheritance to be

218
00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:17.149
theirs. And they say since he will have no one to inherit the vineyard, the vineyard will fall to us.

219
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:27.149
And of course, Jesus was referring to himself and he's referring to the fact that without realizing

220
00:41:27.159 --> 00:41:35.100
that every time we pursue possessions instead of inheritance. We're killing the son and we're

221
00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:41.790
leaving him to rot in the fields of the vineyard. And instead of being able to take possession of

222
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:48.760
what God would want for us, we end up just being a rotting corpse with no inheritance at all.

223
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:59.870
I know this is a heavy and it's about to get worse. I'm sorry, I'm gonna apologize for it now.

224
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:11.189
But with all stories, there's a happy ending when it comes to faith because this is not how it ends.

225
00:42:11.979 --> 00:42:20.060
But it's important for us to understand how it begins and how it gets worse because unless we can do

226
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:26.790
that, then we can't experience a turning point in our own life. See right now, you're thinking of a

227
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:34.040
way that you can take possession. But what you should be thinking about is how you already have the

228
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:34.840
inheritance.

229
00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:46.500
You see, if you make every decision towards taking possession, you are going to lose out on the

230
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:53.510
inheritance. God is saying you already have an inheritance that I never want you to lose. And the

231
00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:00.429
way that you hold on to it and experience it and live it for generations to come is by making sure

232
00:43:00.439 --> 00:43:07.600
that I am the God of your inheritance instead of you following after the king or queen of the

233
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.050
possession instead.

234
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.739
So what are you pursuing?

235
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.979
What is your motivation for bringing that into your life?

236
00:43:20.179 --> 00:43:27.459
And so interestingly enough in this story, Elijah is allowed to go and speak to the king because the

237
00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:33.040
part that I didn't tell you is that name is invited to this incredible feast and he's given the

238
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.350
place of honor in it.

239
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:43.300
And Naboth thinks this is gonna be a great day. I'm invited. Looks like everything's OK with the king.

240
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:49.510
He's accepted my decision. He's invited me to this feast. He's given me the place of honor. Maybe

241
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:57.330
this is going to be about a future that is going to be even greater than I could have imagined. But

242
00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:05.239
but Jezebel in seeing how Ahab was distraught, she says, I want you to find two scoundrels and I

243
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:13.050
want you to see them on either side of and and I want one to curse him and say that he actually

244
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:19.050
spoke out against the king and the other one, I want him to say that he spoke out against God.

245
00:44:21.189 --> 00:44:24.270
And so they bear false witness against.

246
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.669
And so my neighbor is accused in this feast in front of everyone to have cursed God and to have

247
00:44:33.679 --> 00:44:34.469
cursed the king.

248
00:44:36.979 --> 00:44:47.850
And so they take neighbors out of the palace, out of the feast, out of the place of prestige and

249
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.780
they stone him to death and they take his vineyard

250
00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:02.520
and on the day in which Ahab is walking through his newly acquired possession,

251
00:45:04.719 --> 00:45:15.750
a possession that was never his inheritance. Yeah, Elijah confronts him and he goes right to him and

252
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:25.040
he says these are the words of the Lord in first kings 21 he says, have you not murdered a man and

253
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:33.370
sees this property then say to him, this is what the Lord says in the place where dogs licked up

254
00:45:33.379 --> 00:45:43.000
neighbors, blood dogs will lick up your blood. Yes, yours. And then ahab says to Elijah, so you have

255
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.139
found me, my enemy.

256
00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:51.149
And then Elijah says, I have found you

257
00:45:53.709 --> 00:46:01.250
because he is the enemy of God because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.

258
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:07.919
And then he says this concerning his wife. He says, and concerning Jezebel, this is what the Lord

259
00:46:07.929 --> 00:46:15.830
says, dogs are gonna devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. And dogs will eat those belonging to

260
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:22.149
Ahab who die in the city and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. And there was

261
00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:28.530
never anyone like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord urged on by Jezebel, his

262
00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:36.219
wife and he behaved in a vilest manner by going after idols like the Amorites that the Lord

263
00:46:36.229 --> 00:46:43.840
drove out before Israel. And after he hears all these things, you would think that maybe this would

264
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:51.879
be an opportunity for them to repent. Well, the Bible says that for a moment, Ahab does, he, he does

265
00:46:51.889 --> 00:46:59.199
repent. He turns from this moment and he realizes what he's done and he's overtaken by grief. And

266
00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:06.770
then the Bible says that he actually fasts and covers himself with sack cloths and ashes and he

267
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:13.860
seems to reveal true repentance. And everyone thinks, well, maybe this is the moment in which things

268
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:18.699
really change in Ahab's life. But they don't,

269
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:26.479
I don't know if that's ever happened to you where you've just been so convicted and you felt so

270
00:47:26.489 --> 00:47:31.810
condemned and ashamed and you just felt like this was a moment in which you said I will never do

271
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:37.360
this again. And you got up from that moment with the, the kind of determination that you felt like

272
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:43.239
you've never had before. And you thought to yourself, this is it. I'm never going back. I'm never

273
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.760
gonna be that person again. I'm never gonna make these choices again. I'm never gonna be like this

274
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:54.870
again. And then it passes. Come on, let's be real. Has that ever happened to you? Come on, it's

275
00:47:54.879 --> 00:48:03.030
happened to me. I know I know what happens to us and I, and I'll tell you why it's so easy to go

276
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.590
back.

277
00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:11.429
It's so easy to go back to the way we were because we still haven't understood the difference

278
00:48:11.439 --> 00:48:13.189
between possession and inheritance.

279
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:26.530
We go back because we would rather have the possession then truly inherit what God has in store for

280
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:26.800
us.

281
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:37.100
And that's the turning point. I, I if we can identify that moment when it's happening to us, we're

282
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:41.429
gonna be able to say God, this is just another possession. I'm trying to bring into my life I'm

283
00:48:41.439 --> 00:48:46.550
willing to murder anyone and anything in my way just so that I can have it. I don't care what

284
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.330
happens and who gives it to me. I just want it that badly and I'm gonna trample over anyone and

285
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:56.209
anything that I have to, to get it. I'll lie, I'll steal, I'll cheat, I'll even kill, I'll do

286
00:48:56.219 --> 00:49:01.540
whatever it takes because I just want the possession and when we are trapped in that mindset, and we

287
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:06.340
are taking steps in that direction, when we are living a life according to the possession, that's

288
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:13.620
what happens. But what should stop us is what the prophet does. And then he says, I don't care about

289
00:49:13.629 --> 00:49:18.120
your possessions and I don't care about how you are always trying to acquire possessions. What I

290
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:24.399
care about is honoring the God of my inheritance and they both didn't care about the amount that was

291
00:49:24.409 --> 00:49:29.169
gonna be given to him. He would have been wealthy beyond measure. You're kidding me? You're giving

292
00:49:29.179 --> 00:49:34.050
up your vineyard to the king sometimes. That's what we do. Like we, we just look at the moment in

293
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:39.195
which we can profit from it financially. We look at the deal and we look at the moment and we say,

294
00:49:39.205 --> 00:49:45.544
of course we should sell. Are you kidding? We'll never have this opportunity again. Let's just do it.

295
00:49:45.614 --> 00:49:53.250
But Naboth, he sticks to his convictions and he says, I cannot sell my inheritance. See, there was someone

296
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:59.560
else who felt like that there was someone else who understood that and it was Jacob and Esau was

297
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:07.129
willing to sell it. It meant nothing to him because he didn't care about the inheritance. He just

298
00:50:07.139 --> 00:50:12.850
cared about the possession. See over and over again in the scriptures. When someone has the ability

299
00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:18.820
to inherit something that will last forever, someone that can be passed down from generation to

300
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:26.270
generation. Satan is always gonna come into your life and tempt you with the possession instead. And

301
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:33.030
he's gonna say compromise here. Do this, pick the wrong person to be your spouse. Go ahead, take

302
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:41.659
your possession, take it, forget about the inheritance. Sell this. Don't worry about what comes next.

303
00:50:42.419 --> 00:50:49.939
Take this job be this person. Put this in your nose, smoke, this, do this, do that, do whatever it

304
00:50:49.949 --> 00:50:56.360
is. Take the possession but don't elevate your life to becoming everything that God wants you to

305
00:50:56.370 --> 00:51:04.800
become so that you can have his inheritance over and over again. We're being put in a position to

306
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:12.719
just settle for the possession. And if you can see that that's going to be the turning point because

307
00:51:12.729 --> 00:51:20.750
the prophecy that God declares over Ahab and Jezebel is, is one that always will come true just like

308
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:27.540
it would in our own lives. In first kings, we see what happens

309
00:51:29.949 --> 00:51:38.520
to a the Bible says in chapter 22 verses 34 to 37 that when he goes out to war, even though he's

310
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:43.760
armored it says, someone drew his bow at random

311
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:51.649
and he hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor.

312
00:51:53.939 --> 00:51:59.530
And the king told his chariot driver wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded

313
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:05.739
and all day long the battle rage and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Aras and the

314
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:12.469
blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot. And that evening he died. And as the sun was

315
00:52:12.479 --> 00:52:21.270
setting a cry spread through the army, every man to his town, every man to his land. And so the king

316
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.350
died and was brought to Samaria and they buried him there and they washed the chariot at a pool in

317
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:32.489
Samaria where the prostitutes bat and the dogs licked up his blood as the word of the Lord had

318
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:41.270
declared. But what's cool about the story is that the arrow was shot at random

319
00:52:44.189 --> 00:52:49.939
and, and what the author is trying to say in the story is that it wasn't random at all, was it

320
00:52:52.719 --> 00:53:00.850
that that guy shot his arrow randomly? But God made sure that that arrow hit exactly where it needed

321
00:53:01.379 --> 00:53:09.979
to hit so that he would die because at some point, the chances run out. And what God is saying to us

322
00:53:09.989 --> 00:53:15.719
is that I don't want that to be you. I don't want to keep giving you and offering you an inheritance

323
00:53:15.729 --> 00:53:22.439
and you can just keep choosing possession instead. And I don't want something seemingly random to

324
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:29.070
happen when all along it's been prophesized already over your life. If you continue on this path,

325
00:53:29.939 --> 00:53:37.709
that this is what the outcome will be. And then when it comes to Jezebel, the Bible tells us that

326
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:47.639
she does something really interesting in Second Kings in chapter nine verses 30 it says that Je who

327
00:53:47.649 --> 00:53:54.340
went to Jezreel and when Jezebel heard about it, uh she puts on a makeup, she arranges her hair and

328
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:55.370
she looks out a window

329
00:53:57.449 --> 00:54:02.739
and what she thinks is gonna happen because it's happened before is that in the same way that king

330
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:09.639
ahab picked her because of her external beauty. She thinks she might be able to convince of the

331
00:54:09.649 --> 00:54:10.080
saint,

332
00:54:12.629 --> 00:54:21.780
but because she's ugly on the inside and Jehu doesn't care about the possession, he only cares about

333
00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:32.649
the inheritance, he says, who's with me? And there were three servants there who looked at Jehu and said,

334
00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:36.199
we've been waiting for this day when we could quit

335
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:46.520
and not have to serve this woman anymore. Consider this our resignation and they picked her up and

336
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:47.669
they threw her out a window

337
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.439
and she hit the wall all the way down.

338
00:54:54.739 --> 00:55:02.870
And then a chariot ran her over and they said that when they went to pick up what was left, it was

339
00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:07.389
just a skull, hands and feet.

340
00:55:10.949 --> 00:55:11.879
And then they said,

341
00:55:14.439 --> 00:55:15.290
we're just gonna

342
00:55:17.989 --> 00:55:24.909
take this body. And then they said of the king's daughter

343
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:35.290
and then what they did is they went back to our place of origin. She wasn't the king's wife and she

344
00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:45.120
wasn't the queen of the people, but she was just a daughter to a king.

345
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.969
And the Bible says that the dogs ate what was left,

346
00:55:55.899 --> 00:55:57.469
who's feeling encouraged this morning?

347
00:56:01.469 --> 00:56:10.439
At least the dogs always eat in the story. I think that's the moral. The dogs always get something

348
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:17.250
out of it. Even if everyone else does it, the dogs reign and they shall rule the earth. No, that is

349
00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.139
not the message. But

350
00:56:20.439 --> 00:56:26.239
I think it is important for us to see what happens when we go after possession instead of

351
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:33.370
inheritance. Is this starting to sink in a little bit. I mean, the stories are told not so that it

352
00:56:33.379 --> 00:56:42.570
builds up the wrong kind of fear in us, but the right kind of reverence so that we understand the

353
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:48.129
difference between those two things. And if we can understand that, then things can really change in

354
00:56:48.139 --> 00:56:55.590
our lives. So I've got a few verses that I want to just put out there before you. And, and in second

355
00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:03.000
Corinthians chapter four verse 16, it says therefore, we do not lose heart because even though

356
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:09.979
outwardly, we are wasting away yet inwardly, we are being renewed day by day.

357
00:57:12.659 --> 00:57:18.550
And so even when we are struggling, and even when we have lived a life of making choices after the

358
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:25.500
possession instead of the inheritance. God is saying, today is a new day. It doesn't have to

359
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:33.959
continue to be like that. And just like the prophet came to Ahab in the vineyard and just like the

360
00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:42.510
owner of the vineyard sends his son to the workers of the vineyard. God is always sending us

361
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:50.790
messages, reminding us to stop pursuing the possession and start living the inheritance. Instead

362
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:59.659
that today is a day in which we can seize that inheritance and, and take the steps forward to

363
00:57:59.669 --> 00:58:05.790
experience something like we've never experienced it before. Instead of seeing our life and our

364
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:16.409
futures squandered, let's see them build up and take possession of all the things that God has

365
00:58:16.419 --> 00:58:24.860
already declared to be our inheritance. Instead of us trying to bring in the possessions. Let God be

366
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:35.010
the one who declares what that inheritance is instead so that we don't have to live a life that is

367
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:42.459
lost, but one that is found instead, that's what God wants for you. That's what he wants for me.

368
00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:49.790
That's what he keeps reminding me of. It's what he keeps leading me towards and encouraging me for

369
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:56.780
and, and saying to me, don't give up that today wasn't such a good day. But tomorrow, let's do this

370
00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:03.540
different. Let's be different. Today, you, you went after the possession, you should have gone after

371
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:10.860
the inheritance. It's ok. Tomorrow we will go after it together because you have taken a turning

372
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:15.919
point in your life. I know what you're thinking. What about the decision that I've already made. The

373
00:59:15.929 --> 00:59:20.800
one that I'm already living with the, the possession that I've already brought into my life. Listen,

374
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:28.060
when we give ourselves and we give our decisions and we give over to God, everything that we have

375
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:34.219
acquired and taken possession of, even though we know that it wasn't his inheritance. I want you to

376
00:59:34.229 --> 00:59:42.350
know that God can take all of that and turn it into an inheritance for us. He can turn that around

377
00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:51.169
for you. It doesn't have to be the way the story ends. So what God wants from you is to not just

378
00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:59.260
accept things the way they are. And so if you have an unbelieving partner or spouse or someone in

379
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:04.179
your life and, and you look at that and you say, well, that's just the way it's always going to be.

380
01:00:04.189 --> 01:00:11.939
No, you're accepting possession instead of inheritance, your inheritance is that He will come and

381
01:00:11.949 --> 01:00:18.209
she will come to know the Lord that you will build your house and it will glorify the name of Jesus

382
01:00:18.639 --> 01:00:24.439
and that it will do that for generations to come. I don't know what other decision you've made that

383
01:00:24.449 --> 01:00:30.370
maybe you feel stuck in that. You feel that you can't see turn around, but here's how this works.

384
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:37.510
You can't do it but God can and will you trust him for the turnaround? Will you trust him for the

385
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.280
turning point in your life? See, in Galatians chapter three, verse 29. And we end with this verse,

386
01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:52.199
it says that now that you belong to Christ, you are the true Children of Abraham. You are his heirs

387
01:00:53.510 --> 01:01:02.000
and God's promise to Abraham belongs to you. God is saying this is your inheritance. I am your

388
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:10.610
inheritance and I will ensure your generation after generation after generation to inherit the same

389
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:16.429
promise if you inherit it first, are you ready to inherit that promise? you ready to have that for

390
01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:17.110
yourself?

391
01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:26.120
Maybe we're gonna be the first ones to inherit that promise and then every generation after us will

392
01:01:26.129 --> 01:01:35.919
inherit it too. So let's be the first. Let's break that terrible pattern of possession and let's

393
01:01:35.929 --> 01:01:42.409
start living a life of inheritance instead, God bless you guys. Thank you so much for listening and

394
01:01:42.419 --> 01:01:43.780
being a part of this today.

395
01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:51.090
And uh we're just gonna pray, take a moment and uh we're gonna sing another song with the worship

396
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:57.689
team and that's gonna move us uh after that into announcements. So just stick around for the, for

397
01:01:57.699 --> 01:02:02.550
that. And then we have of course, uh an announcement with regards to the food that's being prepared

398
01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.060
as well. So would you just stand with me as we will close in a word of prayer? And

399
01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.659
we're going to pray for this moment, but it's also going to be a moment where we close and,

400
01:02:17.399 --> 01:02:24.580
and ask God that we would become people of his inheritance. Are you ready to receive that you ready

401
01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:33.199
to have that no more people of possession, but people of inheritance instead. And so father, we come

402
01:02:33.209 --> 01:02:40.949
before you and we thank you for the inheritance. We thank you for making us heirs. And what that

403
01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:44.919
means, Lord is that there is nothing in this world that doesn't already belong to you that is going

404
01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.159
to get passed down to us.

405
01:02:48.449 --> 01:02:56.810
And so it is foolish of us. Oh God to go out into this world and try to gather possessions. When we

406
01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:04.389
already have the inheritance, it's already been promised, it's already been given. All we have to do

407
01:03:04.399 --> 01:03:10.540
is remain faithful to you. And so when things come into our life that want to distract us and

408
01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:20.070
detract us from the path of receiving that inheritance, Lord in the form of a possession, we are

409
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.649
going to reject it. We are going to rebuke it and we are gonna run from it because we want your

410
01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:33.600
inheritance instead. And we ask these things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Are you

411
01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:39.030
ready to sing this song? Let's do it together. And I'll be right back after this song to just share

412
01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.770
some announcements with you. At the end,

413
01:03:49.679 --> 01:03:55.300
we're going to sing about the Lord's freedom that it may break us free of all our team that is

414
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:59.929
breaking, that is holding us and just to speak freedom in our life.

426
01:08:07.159 --> 01:08:15.439
Wow. See, aren't you glad we didn't end with my message? So much better. So we have a community

427
01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:22.919
kitchen brunch that's happening today. And uh we've got two lines set up for you, one on my left and

428
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:28.549
right. And so you can line up at either one. The food is exactly the same. Just don't, don't think

429
01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:35.259
that there's like something there that's not over there. It's identical. The only thing that changes

430
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:40.999
is the people serving. So you can line up at either one. And what we want to do is make it as quick

431
01:08:41.008 --> 01:08:48.199
as possible for you to get your food so that you can continue experiencing friendship and have

432
01:08:48.208 --> 01:08:54.159
community. And we just want to give it up to our community kitchen team for that

433
01:08:57.079 --> 01:09:03.829
amazing, amazing, amazing people. And we just want to remind everyone that every Sunday you guys can

434
01:09:03.838 --> 01:09:12.169
bring donations. There's a donation box that's been set up and you can always bring food so that we

435
01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:19.009
can not only use it for meals like this, but we can give it out to our guests. We also have clothing

436
01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.930
that we'd like to give out. And so we encourage you to bring that in as well so that they, our team

437
01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:31.189
can go through it and then whatever we don't use, we just give it to another organization that can't,

438
01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:36.250
so nothing gets wasted, everything gets reused and it's given out to the people that need it most.

439
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:41.520
So we also have a guys and girls bowling event that's coming up and you'll be able to start signing

440
01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:46.439
up for that next Sunday. And so we want to encourage you guys for that. We also have a pulse retreat.

441
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:53.509
We're gonna have information on our website for that and also be able to get information next Sunday.

442
01:09:53.869 --> 01:09:59.999
And we want to encourage you guys to just be aware of the different ways that you can give

443
01:10:00.008 --> 01:10:06.398
financially to our church. Um The things that we do, the ministries that we give out, the money that

444
01:10:06.409 --> 01:10:13.048
we also give back uh overseas and the things that we do, not just locally, but also globally, all of

445
01:10:13.059 --> 01:10:18.769
that happens because of your donations. And then the last thing is that we have launched our prayer

446
01:10:18.778 --> 01:10:25.080
ministry. We've got a prayer team that's right here uh on to the right of, of me and they are ready

447
01:10:25.169 --> 01:10:31.979
to help you take your next step with resources, a bible if you need it, there's other things in

448
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:38.180
English and in French available for you to help you on your spiritual journey. But they also want to

449
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:45.720
pray with you and to pray for you there's a card that you can fill out. That can also be something

450
01:10:45.729 --> 01:10:51.169
that you want to put the prayer request down on so that our prayer team can continue to pray for you

451
01:10:51.399 --> 01:10:56.169
and pray for the need that you have brought forward. We just want you to know that we are here for

452
01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:02.569
you and that we are praying for you as well. So God bless you guys. Have a great Sunday. Have an

453
01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:09.040
awesome week. I look forward to continuing this series with you next Sunday. So enjoy the meal. It's

454
01:11:09.049 --> 01:11:15.939
blessed. You're blessed because we have all received the same inheritance. God bless you guys.
