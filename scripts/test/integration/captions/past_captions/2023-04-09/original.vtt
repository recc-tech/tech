00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:12.910
Good morning, Rivers Edge. Welcome. We're so happy to have you here. Hello to everybody that's

2
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:25.679
online and happy Easter. He is alive. He is risen and we can say that with full confidence. This is

3
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.470
something I've been reflecting on. It's something that our small group has been discussing. This was

4
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:41.010
a real event. Jesus died and three days later, he came back and people were so compelled by what

5
00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:47.980
they saw, what they witnessed that they had to document it. They wrote it down for safe keeping so

6
00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:54.845
that we could pass it on so that they he could pass it on because God needed you to know and me to

7
00:07:54.855 --> 00:08:00.315
know that regardless of your state today, how you came in today, how you're feeling today, your

8
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:08.774
financial situation, your emotional situation, your relational situation, it can be resurrected and

9
00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:15.559
we can have faith in that. So what we're gonna do today is we're gonna celebrate that together. So

10
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:22.640
we are going to stand church. We are gonna stand because God loves us and we are grateful and we are

11
00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:30.140
going to unify our voices and our minds and our hearts. Our worship team has an T set for us today.

12
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:39.580
Eight songs for now. Four later. So let's make a joyful noise and celebrate our gratitude to our God.

13
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.979
It's not done. We're passing through. We're gonna see him again. Amen.

14
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.840
Would you thank God for loving us and giving us that resurrected life, that life to the fullest

15
00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:25.440
Steve.

16
00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:44.679
people come but I see.

17
00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:42.320
Bring all your failures, bring your admissions.

18
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.330

21
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.000
Pray from

22
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.349

23
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.950

friends

25
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:24.969
To say

27
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.090
freedom,

28
00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:17.020
because Jesus is way God.

29
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.719
Can we sing about our God? Can we sing about our Jesus? This next song is about just reminds us

30
00:13:36.729 --> 00:13:42.739
whatever we're going through, whatever your situation God will and God can and will turn it around.

31
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.969
So let's believe that together. Uh Let's all sing.

32
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.500
Big song. Need to

36
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.039
I've searched

37
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.000
treasures.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.799
You love me,

crazy.

55
00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:54.219
We're gonna take it down a little bit and talk about the resurrection and the miracle that is still

56
00:19:54.229 --> 00:20:01.439
the most mysterious and the most majestic of all and why we call ourselves Christians. It means that

57
00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:10.060
we can believe that God can do anything. He can bring things back from dead to life. So that is the

58
00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:12.359
miracle of our Jesus Christ. Thank you

59
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.239
of New York.

60
00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:45.459
And the C eu was calm with just a

61
00:20:48.709 --> 00:20:52.199

and stars they wear them, son was dead. The same

84
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:05.510
was

85
00:26:35.089 --> 00:26:35.920
one final

86
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.189
has have

87
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.530
is

88
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.500
We sing how

89
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:43.770
we sing. Hallelujah. We sing Hallelujah. The lamb has overcome. We sing Hallelujah. We sing

Hallelujah. We sing high. Yeah. Is all we sing high

and

92
00:29:59.469 --> 00:30:01.180
sing. Hallelujah

93
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:06.189
is over you.

94
00:30:13.189 --> 00:30:13.489
Hi

95
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:19.239
quick.

96
00:30:25.369 --> 00:30:25.900
We

97
00:30:31.989 --> 00:30:32.569
we

98
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:35.930
we

99
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.030
we

100
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:07.510
what?

101
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:04.560
Life moves fast, doesn't it? Every day? There is so much to fit in.

102
00:32:11.089 --> 00:32:17.140
But do you ever stop and think? What's the point of it all? Do you ever ask yourself? Is there more

103
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:18.060
to life than this?

104
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.760
Alpha is a series of sessions exploring life, faith and meaning. It's a space to explore the big

105
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.300
questions to say what you think and hear other people's points of view.

106
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.189
First up there's food, then a talk followed by a discussion.

107
00:32:44.939 --> 00:32:50.109
Each talk explores a different aspect of the Christian faith. And then in the small group, you get

108
00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:51.829
to say exactly what you think

109
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.469
the aim of the talk is to spark conversation each week. Unpacking a different question.

110
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:09.199
There's no obligation to say anything and there's nothing you can't say seriously.

111
00:33:11.869 --> 00:33:16.969
It's an opportunity to hear from others and contribute your own perspective in an honest, friendly

112
00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:19.199
and open environment. Why not try it out

113
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.239
an Easter morning? Am I right?

114
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:39.270
The worship team has been working so, so hard in preparation. So let's give them one more

115
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.229
encouragement this morning.

116
00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:52.609
So we're gonna dismiss the kids now. So any kids, you can head off to the annex, they're waiting for

117
00:33:52.619 --> 00:34:01.359
you. They have programming for you guys. So we'll let the kids leave us. And now for everyone else

118
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:08.199
announcements announcement announcements. So first on the docket is alpha course, we have an

119
00:34:08.209 --> 00:34:16.479
upcoming alpha course starting here Saturday morning, April 22 and I would highly recommend the

120
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:22.550
alpha course. It really is for everybody. I've done it a couple of times. It's a great forum. It's

121
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:30.560
video based um with some live teaching and then voluntary discussion. It is low pressure and it's

122
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:36.479
for really everyone you could be a lifelong believer or be exploring. What is this thing?

123
00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:41.309
Spirituality. What is this thing? God what is this thing? Faith. It's about asking questions and

124
00:34:41.319 --> 00:34:47.428
curiosity. I learn something every time I do it and it's just a really great space. There will be a

125
00:34:47.438 --> 00:34:53.989
light breakfast served as well. So you can come hungry and have some great uh food for thought as

126
00:34:53.999 --> 00:35:02.639
well. So that is April 22nd right here and you can sign up at the back at the info table. Belong

127
00:35:02.649 --> 00:35:09.300
groups. So I'm a huge supporter of belong groups. Church doesn't end here on Sunday. It's so

128
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:14.860
important that we're journeying with people that we can confide in that we can be vulnerable with,

129
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:21.574
that can challenge us and that know us. And so belong groups are small spaces, groups of people that

130
00:35:21.584 --> 00:35:26.465
come together, they might do a study, it might be a discussion group. Um Today we're highlighting a

131
00:35:26.475 --> 00:35:34.665
particular group that joins here, meets here on Wednesday evenings at seven PM and it's a discussion

132
00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:40.344
based. There's a topic that's presented every week and people chat and there's, uh, a worship

133
00:35:40.354 --> 00:35:47.340
portion to the evening as well. And so if you're looking for a group to join, um, again, no pressure,

134
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:53.239
but Wednesday evenings, it's here, you might want to check it out. Um And if you have questions, I'm

135
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:59.560
gonna turn them to, uh, Patty, can you just wave? Yeah, Patty will know all about it. You can ask

136
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:08.830
her, um, after this service, Community Kitchen Brunch. So Sunday, April 23 after the gathering

137
00:36:08.889 --> 00:36:15.239
please stay. We're going to be having a brunch. We're so blessed. The community kitchen serves up

138
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:20.860
such wonderful meals for us in community. So it's an opportunity to be fed. It's an opportunity to

139
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:24.989
get to know people that you might not have already met at the, at the church and within this

140
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.949
community, it's always a good time. And so invite somebody um on the 23rd to join you for brunch

141
00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:39.060
here after the service. And finally, we do have four ways to give here at River's edge. Um We have a

142
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:44.250
mission within the church. We have a mission outside of the church. We have outreaches that we

143
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:53.110
support and those outreaches need your support. And so we have four ways to give. Giving is an act

144
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.330
of worship, it is an act of faith. And so we've made it really easy. So whatever God compels you to

145
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:05.129
help us with, we appreciate it. So let's prepare ourselves. Pastor Lorenzo is coming out with a

146
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:06.139
message for us

147
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:27.199
while we turned away from him, he turned his heart toward us while we chased after selfish desires,

148
00:37:27.459 --> 00:37:36.000
he chased after us while we made excuses for our misguided choices, pursuing an elusive sense of

149
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:45.169
fulfillment. He emptied himself to take the form of a servant, this unthinkable inequity, our

150
00:37:45.189 --> 00:37:54.449
creator clothed in flesh and weakness for the sake of those clothed in inequity while we were lost

151
00:37:54.459 --> 00:38:02.959
and alone. He became a path for us while we embraced the comfort of falsehood, he embraced us and

152
00:38:02.969 --> 00:38:11.510
showed us truth. While we were eclipsed in shadow, our spirits broken and dying. He became life and

153
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:21.409
light to all our shepherd, our teacher, our savior and king. And when it seemed, the world had given

154
00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:28.919
up, he gave up everything. At just the right time. When we were powerless, he displayed his power

155
00:38:28.929 --> 00:38:36.989
and purpose. While we stood accused, he accepted the accusation, he endured the humiliation and the

156
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.090
untold suffering of crucifixion. For while we were still sinners. Christ died for us.

157
00:38:49.669 --> 00:38:57.659
Not because we deserved it far from it, but because there has never been a greater love than the

158
00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:08.919
love of Jesus. Today. If you feel hopeless, he gives hope unconditionally. If you've been rejected,

159
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:15.770
he accepts you completely. If your burdens weigh heavy, lay your fears and failures at the foot of

160
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:25.209
the cross for his blood has erased them entirely, no longer a slave but an heir of salvation. You

161
00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:32.989
are his child is chosen. You are his beloved.

162
00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:50.909
Amazing. It's a beautiful video. It's a wonderful reminder of what this time is all about. And this

163
00:39:50.919 --> 00:39:56.120
time that we have together to be able to celebrate Easter is an opportunity for us to just show our

164
00:39:56.129 --> 00:40:02.590
gratitude to the Lord for what he has done. But also what he is doing even in the moments of our

165
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.300
life where we are still facing challenges and difficulties. And today we're going to hear more about

166
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:13.659
that in the passage that we're about to read. The story that we are going to look at today is a

167
00:40:13.669 --> 00:40:20.379
story that is known to us. But one that I hope we can highlight some areas that can speak to us in a

168
00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:28.520
new way today, we're going to be talking about beloved. And as we just heard in this video, we are

169
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:35.439
beloved. God loves us and because he loves us, he has given up everything for us. One of the

170
00:40:35.449 --> 00:40:43.024
beautiful things in the story in which we are in is that there was a disciple that he called beloved

171
00:40:43.034 --> 00:40:50.764
and that was John and John was the youngest of the 12. And he was the one that Jesus had a real

172
00:40:50.774 --> 00:40:57.445
affinity with in terms of loving him like a younger brother. And in the story in which we're in,

173
00:40:58.044 --> 00:41:04.804
Peter and John are the ones who hear the news and then make their way to the tomb. So let's read

174
00:41:04.814 --> 00:41:11.770
that together as it's found in John chapter 20 and beginning at verse one. And it says that early on

175
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:19.129
Sunday morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and found that the stone had

176
00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:27.209
been rolled away from the entrance. And so she ran and she found Simon Peter and the other disciple,

177
00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:35.090
the one whom Jesus loved. And she said they have taken the Lord's body out of the tomb and we don't

178
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:41.489
know where they have put him. And then Peter and the other disciples started out for the tomb and

179
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:50.750
they were both running. But the other disciple which is John Outran Peter. And he reached the tomb

180
00:41:50.760 --> 00:42:01.110
first. But he stops and he looks in and he sees the linen wrappings lying there, but he doesn't go

181
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:09.979
in. And then Simon Peter arrived and he went inside and he also noticed the linen wrappings lying

182
00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:18.969
there and while the cloth that had covered Jesus's head was folded up and lying apart from all the

183
00:42:18.979 --> 00:42:27.010
other wrappings. And then the disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and

184
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:35.689
believed for until then, they still hadn't understood the scriptures that said Jesus must rise from

185
00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:44.899
the dead. And then they went home, Simon Peter and John the beloved in the story in which we are in,

186
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:52.600
we see that they run to an empty tomb and sometimes it feels like in this life, that's what we're

187
00:42:52.610 --> 00:43:00.090
doing. We're just running and we're running often, not just towards things that are empty, but we're

188
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:08.469
running on empty. We feel like we're empty. We feel like we don't have much to not only rely on but

189
00:43:08.479 --> 00:43:18.250
also that which we need to be refreshed by that, which can also enable us to keep running in this

190
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:27.199
life that is so frantic. Let's just look at what we've been through the last four years, let alone

191
00:43:27.209 --> 00:43:35.760
the last four days. It seems that every time we are out of something, something else comes after us.

192
00:43:35.939 --> 00:43:44.489
Something else is there to challenge us. Something else is there to bring chaos to us. The story is

193
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:51.449
about them running, but to make matters worse, they're not running to a tomb that Jesus is in.

194
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:58.500
They're running to an empty tomb and that isn't good news when they hear it. What it does is that it

195
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:06.179
shows them that there's just strips of linen, there's no body, there's no Jesus. It's a defeat upon

196
00:44:06.189 --> 00:44:13.729
defeat. Not only did they have to go through the crucifixion, the scattered of all of their plans

197
00:44:13.739 --> 00:44:20.270
and, and even of their disciples, but now they find themselves not even having anything to hold on

198
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:29.830
to and to cling to defeat upon defeat. Have you ever been on one of those losing streaks? Have you

199
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.439
ever felt like nothing is going your way? It's like one thing after another and you keep asking

200
00:44:36.449 --> 00:44:43.239
yourself kind of like what else can go wrong and then something else does. It's like you're afraid

201
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:49.889
to even wish for good things to say or pronounce good things. You keep looking for wood to knock on

202
00:44:49.899 --> 00:44:55.379
for salt to throw. You're looking for a good luck charm. You're hoping that's going to come somehow

203
00:44:55.389 --> 00:45:01.250
some way you're doing whatever you think is going to help you by not only having positive thoughts

204
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:07.929
but lifting up positive prayers, you're doing whatever you can to try to bring luck your way. But

205
00:45:07.939 --> 00:45:16.129
imagine what the disciples were experiencing when grief was being poured out upon more grief. I mean,

206
00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:27.600
they were actually involved in a foot race to nothing. They were going to experience anything. They

207
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:36.500
were just going to a place that had nothing to offer them. And that's what sometimes life can feel

208
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:45.800
like. It's more about the fear of what we will find rather than the race that we are running to

209
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:54.949
receive God's favor. And I want us to believe that arriving first sometimes has some kind of of

210
00:45:54.959 --> 00:46:02.709
benefit. It has some kind of blessing. I don't know if you are a runner. The only thing I run to

211
00:46:02.719 --> 00:46:09.129
these days is the fridge. But if you are athletic and you love to stay active and you love to run,

212
00:46:09.139 --> 00:46:16.070
then I know that you love doing it no matter what the weather is, it doesn't deter you. You go out

213
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:22.870
and you get the work done, you love it. It's something that's a part of you. I know people like this.

214
00:46:22.879 --> 00:46:30.820
People who will run miles and miles no matter what the weather is and they cannot find a reason to

215
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:36.449
stay in because the reasons to go out outweigh whatever it is that's wanting to keep them in.

216
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:43.310
Sometimes it's the opposite for us. The things that are holding us back just kind of outweigh the

217
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:50.320
reasons to get out, to believe, to do things differently, to experience life in another way. God is

218
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:56.810
trying to push us to new levels, but we're unfortunately so beaten down and tired of running to

219
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:02.830
nothing that we just imagine that it's just going to be more of the same. And so we stop believing,

220
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:09.530
we stop having faith. We stop trusting that God still has favor for us that he can still do

221
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:15.199
something in us, do something for our relationship, do something for our health, do something for

222
00:47:15.209 --> 00:47:21.360
our finances that he can still do something in our families that he can still restore that. He can

223
00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:28.250
still do that, which we trouble believing, which is resurrect dead things and bring them back to

224
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:38.919
life. But God wants us to run, but he wants us to run believing and trusting that when we do arrive,

225
00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:48.479
that we're not gonna do what John did. John won the foot race to the tomb. But then he didn't have

226
00:47:48.489 --> 00:47:49.760
the courage to go in.

227
00:47:51.840 --> 00:48:02.610
He stayed on the outside and he did nothing and he waited for Peter to go in first and once Peter

228
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:10.750
went, then something happened in him that caused him to want to go into and sometimes it's happened

229
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:17.489
to us in other areas of our life. You know, like we, we get there first, but then we freeze, we

230
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:23.629
panic, we're filled with fear. We don't know what the next thing is that's going to happen. So we

231
00:48:23.639 --> 00:48:31.330
end up doing nothing. We stay on the outside and then someone else just goes in before us. Has that

232
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.389
ever happened to you?

233
00:48:34.439 --> 00:48:40.489
You see God understands all of these things and all of these meanings in the story are supposed to

234
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:48.010
speak to us and touch us in a place of our past. But it's also supposed to instruct our present and

235
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:54.500
prevent the same thing from being repeated in the future. See, God is addressing these issues so

236
00:48:54.510 --> 00:49:00.389
that He can give us the victory that we need. And so that when we do arrive, that we aren't filled

237
00:49:00.399 --> 00:49:06.030
with fear, but we're filled with boldness and faith to step in to the unknown and whatever it is,

238
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.840
that's in that room, whatever it is, that is in that tomb, whatever it is, that is in that place,

239
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:16.270
whatever it is that is in that person that we are not going to be afraid to go there

240
00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:28.439
and we're going to see what it means to put our faith in God and to trust in his favor, you know,

241
00:49:28.449 --> 00:49:37.780
suffering the loss for those disciples only to have it get worse, just increase the questioning, you

242
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:45.610
know, every life decision and it just made it so that this experience wasn't going to be a good day.

243
00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:50.919
I mean, this is the day of the resurrection, but it isn't a good day for them. The news they got,

244
00:49:50.929 --> 00:49:57.239
they just took it in a bad way. And I wonder how often does that happen in our own lives? Where the

245
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:04.560
Lord has risen today is the best day ever. But the only thing that we can see is still the death of

246
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:12.270
the previous days. The only thing that's still in our mind is the Brokenness and the shattered

247
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.550
suffering of all that we have been through. And so we can't celebrate that morning. We can't

248
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:23.580
celebrate that day. We can't wake up and experience new things because everything from the previous

249
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:31.229
days is just still holding us back. And yet Jesus has still risen. But nothing had changed in Simon

250
00:50:31.239 --> 00:50:38.239
Peter's life, nothing had changed even in John's life, no matter how much Jesus loved John on earth,

251
00:50:38.489 --> 00:50:47.909
John Steele couldn't love Jesus back to the point where he could get into the tomb first and I need

252
00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:54.919
us to see that because I feel like sometimes we, we misunderstand how much God loves us and how much

253
00:50:54.929 --> 00:51:02.830
He's patient with us in loving us because people have given up on us and we've given up on ourselves.

254
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:10.060
And people have stopped loving us so often in our lives that we stop believing in love. And we can't

255
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:16.000
imagine a love that is this powerful that, that they would be this good, that they would be this

256
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:24.820
wholesome, that it would be this capable of restoring and and once again reigniting our faith in God.

257
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:36.370
But in this account, John is telling us that the cross and the empty tomb must speak to our

258
00:51:36.379 --> 00:51:45.449
suffering. And I think that we can't bypass that we can't get beyond it. It has to speak to our

259
00:51:45.459 --> 00:51:53.780
suffering and, and the reason it has to speak to our suffering is that you cannot experience the

260
00:51:53.790 --> 00:52:02.449
power of the resurrection unless you go through the suffering of the cross and the empty tomb. You

261
00:52:02.459 --> 00:52:09.739
see, you're not going to feel like today is a good day. You're not going to feel like tomorrow there

262
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:17.360
is hope. You're not going to feel like you can have faith. Why? Because the cross and the empty tomb

263
00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:24.939
is what you are still living and experiencing that you're still in and not getting past. But at the

264
00:52:24.949 --> 00:52:32.419
same time, it hasn't informed you to the point where now when you look back on that pain, you look

265
00:52:32.429 --> 00:52:37.550
back on that suffering, you look back on everything that you've been through, everything that people

266
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:44.030
have put you through, everything your bad decisions have done to you, everything that has happened

267
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:53.729
in your life, to bring suffering to you and to others. It's gonna bring you to the place all of that

268
00:52:54.199 --> 00:53:03.120
where you are going to be able to announce the power of the resurrection like never before because

269
00:53:03.129 --> 00:53:12.689
you've been through all of that because it is informed what is now going to happen next. You see the

270
00:53:12.699 --> 00:53:23.689
emptiness of the tomb is there to proclaim what it means that Christ is risen. And if the tomb isn't

271
00:53:23.699 --> 00:53:33.489
empty, then we don't know that he's alive and what that tells me is that when I'm living my life and

272
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:43.149
I realize the emptiness of what it actually is. Then I turn away from the empty tomb back to the

273
00:53:43.159 --> 00:53:49.659
risen Jesus. I look at the emptiness that this life has to offer me and the pain and the suffering

274
00:53:49.669 --> 00:53:55.280
that it's brought me, the death that it brought into my life. And then I see that it can't hold me

275
00:53:55.290 --> 00:54:01.969
there just like it couldn't hold Jesus there. It's not gonna hold you there. It's not going to keep

276
00:54:01.979 --> 00:54:08.560
you living that it's not going to be your story. It's not going to be your narrative. It's not going

277
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:16.250
to be the way that people will remember you because God is about to turn things around for you.

278
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:24.790
But you've got to go through the suffering and the empty tomb to be able to experience it. There's

279
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:30.159
something that people don't know about the Christian faith. And one of those things is that it is

280
00:54:30.169 --> 00:54:34.010
the only faith in the world that confesses a God who suffers

281
00:54:36.649 --> 00:54:44.889
because we have a suffering. God, we naturally obviously would prefer that we would have a God who

282
00:54:44.899 --> 00:54:50.500
would prevent suffering. But what God does is that he shows that He is a suffering God that he

283
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:59.419
suffers for us and he suffers extreme brutality at the hands of his own creation to show us that He

284
00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:05.919
is that suffering God. And that that is not going to hold him back from being able to bring the

285
00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:15.169
power of the resurrection into each of our lives. You see the cross and the empty tomb teach us that

286
00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:24.770
he doesn't want to force us to make choices for him and, and that we don't need to always

287
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:33.199
misinterpret and misunderstand how human pain while we keep living it. Is it what is going to

288
00:55:33.209 --> 00:55:41.649
ultimately define us? The pain that is here on this earth, you see the cross and the empty tomb are

289
00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:47.909
given to us because they are going to speak to us about the victory, the victory that God wants to

290
00:55:47.919 --> 00:55:55.260
give you so that you can have a new understanding of this and no longer see it like you have

291
00:55:55.270 --> 00:56:06.199
possibly up until today, Jesus reveals that the power to pick up the shattered pieces of our lives

292
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:13.949
and put them back together to make something beautiful is what he is about. I I I want you to think

293
00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:22.100
about the shattered pieces, the things that cannot be put back together. And I want you to see that

294
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:33.169
Jesus does something in this story that is so unique. Jesus is now glorified. He comes back with a

295
00:56:33.199 --> 00:56:40.449
different body than the one he had. It is now one that is able to live on earth, but it's also one

296
00:56:40.459 --> 00:56:47.040
that has been prepared for where the father is. And what's interesting about Jesus is that his body

297
00:56:47.379 --> 00:56:53.659
could have been healed back to its original state in other words, the, the nails that had been put

298
00:56:53.669 --> 00:57:00.030
through his hands and his feet and the spear that had been put in his side. When the body of Jesus

299
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:07.750
gets glorified in the resurrection, his body could have been restored back and made whole. But

300
00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:16.399
there's something about Jesus needing to keep the nail, peer hands and feet, the spear that went

301
00:57:16.409 --> 00:57:23.300
through his side, all of those things, those scars which could have disappeared. Jesus keeps them

302
00:57:25.209 --> 00:57:30.590
and I want you to understand that in the same way that we walk around this life, a little wounded

303
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:38.850
scarred that when we look back, the pain isn't ever completely gone. Even if the scars remain and

304
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:47.500
speak to the story of how we were once too wounded. There are some things that still when we think

305
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:54.429
of them hurt us as if it is the first day that it happened and, and we think that God doesn't

306
00:57:54.439 --> 00:58:03.969
understand us. You have in Jesus, a suffering savior. He has kept those scars because He wants you

307
00:58:03.979 --> 00:58:08.800
to know that no matter what you've been through, no matter what you're going through, no matter what

308
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:15.669
it is that you may face one day that he gets you. He understands you and he loves you. And he's

309
00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:25.679
always ready to show you how much that is true by revealing his nail scarred hands to you. You see

310
00:58:25.689 --> 00:58:33.070
in John 20 in verse 19 to 21, this is what happens. The disciples were all gathered together and

311
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:38.110
Jesus walks into the room and he says that that Sunday evening, the disciples were meeting behind

312
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:42.709
locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. They thought that they would too be

313
00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:48.510
arrested and been brought out and tried. And then suddenly Jesus was there standing there among them

314
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:54.110
and he says, peace be with you. He said, and then as he spoke, he showed them the wounds in his

315
00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:04.209
hands and in his side. And they were filled with joy when they saw the Lord and then he said to them,

316
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:13.300
peace be with you as the father has sent me. So I am sending you, can we say amen to that is that

317
00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:20.350
beautiful? He knew that they would need to see those signs. And I mean this, I need to know that

318
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:26.530
Jesus is with me. I need to know that he gets me. I think you need that too. I think you need to, to

319
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.510
know that He cares about your suffering. He cares about your pain, that he sees your wounds and he

320
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:38.229
sees your scars and he sees where in your life you still need to be healed. He sees where it is that

321
00:59:38.239 --> 00:59:42.949
you're struggling in your faith and where it is that you no longer believe that God can give you

322
00:59:42.959 --> 00:59:51.770
favor. He sees all of that and today I pray that he, he shows up in this room and he shows up to you

323
00:59:51.780 --> 01:00:01.870
and he shows you the scars that are there to remind us that Jesus is always able to put the pieces

324
01:00:01.879 --> 01:00:09.199
of our broken lives back together again and make it beautiful. Can you believe that for yourself?

325
01:00:10.229 --> 01:00:17.060
That he can do that? That he's gonna do it with those nail scarred hands? He's gonna take those

326
01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:24.399
broken pieces and he's gonna bring them back together and he's gonna make your life beautiful.

327
01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:34.060
That's what he promises. That's why he kept them. That's why he still has them. That's why he wants

328
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:42.620
us to understand them because that is the power of the resurrection for us today. It is Jesus

329
01:00:42.629 --> 01:00:52.040
standing in our midst with those scars. He could have made himself perfect again, but he let himself

330
01:00:52.050 --> 01:01:00.709
stay imperfect so that he could welcome us misfits into the kingdom of heaven so that he could

331
01:01:00.719 --> 01:01:13.500
welcome us, all of us who don't belong, who are never good enough, all of us who are all broken in

332
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:24.989
one way or another back into what it means to be in a relationship with him and he declares his

333
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.689
peace over us. Do you want Jesus to declare his peace over your life right now? Just like he did

334
01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:39.979
over them. You know, when, when Jesus declares peace and that's what you experience. I, I don't know

335
01:01:39.989 --> 01:01:44.080
where you're troubled. I don't know where you've been suffering. I don't know where you're in pain

336
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:49.199
where you've been wounded. I don't know where your life is shattered and broken and in pieces. I

337
01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:54.540
don't know where it is that you need this. But I believe that Jesus is here to declare peace over

338
01:01:54.550 --> 01:02:03.169
your life. And to say from now on what I want you to experience is peace no longer Brokenness. I

339
01:02:03.179 --> 01:02:08.820
want to take this suffering and turn it into something beautiful. Anybody else want that today?

340
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:16.060
Anybody else need that today to have that declared over your life? Let Jesus do that right now. Let

341
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:22.379
him welcome you into that space so you can experience that. I'm gonna invite the worship team to

342
01:02:22.389 --> 01:02:28.290
come back right now and I'm gonna ask you to stand with me as we would just pray over this word that

343
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:35.590
we have heard today that it would be a blessing to us. The kids are gonna have a great time in the

344
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:42.679
annex there. Um I don't know who the Easter bunny is today but someone's an Easter bunny. We don't

345
01:02:42.689 --> 01:02:47.360
want to disclose their, their name in case they want to remain anonymous,

346
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:54.439
but they're gonna do um an egg hunt at the end of the gathering. So parents just be patient. Um

347
01:02:54.449 --> 01:02:58.899
because they're gonna do that and they're gonna do it in this space. Ok? So it's gonna be chaos, but

348
01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:05.959
that's, that's what bringing kids into community is like and we love it. Amen. We love having kids

349
01:03:05.969 --> 01:03:08.239
and love having them here.

350
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.550
And so let's just pray, father. Thank you for this opportunity that you give us to understand a

351
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.229
little better about what it means to experience the victory of the resurrection. And to have that in

352
01:03:21.239 --> 01:03:28.370
a practical way, just made real in our lives. I pray that today, Lord that we would see your favor,

353
01:03:28.379 --> 01:03:35.600
we would have the faith to believe in that favor, to have you declare peace over all of us. Thank

354
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:41.689
you for what you've done for each person here today already. That today may have not been a great

355
01:03:41.699 --> 01:03:48.229
day just like it wasn't for, for Peter and John, but that was the day that you had risen from the

356
01:03:48.239 --> 01:03:55.070
dead and they missed it. They didn't know that that had happened. They were still stuck in their

357
01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:00.500
Brokenness. Lord, I don't want anyone to be stuck in the past here. I don't want anyone to be stuck

358
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:05.149
in their pain and in their suffering and in their Brokenness. That's not what you want for us.

359
01:04:06.149 --> 01:04:11.320
That's not what you want for any of us and just like they could have missed it. Lord, I pray that we

360
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:17.860
don't miss this opportunity right now to experience your peace as you speak it over us in this place.

361
01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:25.340
Thank you for that peace. Lord, thank you for that victory. Thank you that you have risen today in

362
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:33.929
Jesus name. We say amen, amen. God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Let's keep worshiping. Stay

363
01:04:33.939 --> 01:04:38.959
right to the end. It's gonna be a blast. These, they've worked so hard and they've got a few more

364
01:04:38.969 --> 01:04:40.179
songs for us. Amen.

365
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:43.199
Yeah.

366
01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:07.000
Jesus went to the cross and left the tomb empty. And then Lord, you did this because you had us on

367
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.590
your mind. So we're gonna sing about that.

368
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.310
Even the,

369
01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:32.729
this feels like

370
01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:43.909
in the product. So

371
01:05:47.889 --> 01:05:48.600
leaving him

372
01:05:52.399 --> 01:05:52.840
