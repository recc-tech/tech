19
00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:33.530
All right. Well, good morning. It's so good to have you guys here on this hot July Sunday. And uh

20
00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:39.409
we've got some technical issues today. So no videos, no visuals. Um and we're gonna hopefully hand

21
00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:45.609
out some papers for you guys to be able to sing along to the songs today. So we apologize in advance.

22
00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:51.690
We don't know what happened but something happened and uh technology uh just has failed us today.

23
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:58.270
It's always been good. It's always been faithful, but today it is not. And so that sometimes happens,

24
00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:04.510
but we're OK because even when technology fails us. We know the Lord never does. And so today is a

25
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.219
day in which we can rejoice. And uh we want to welcome you to River's Edge. I'm Pastor Lorenzo and I

26
00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:15.969
welcome you to this gathering. Today is a Sunday in which we're going to continue with our series

27
00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:24.429
called Getting There. And we are going uh to hear a message on the topic of following the signs out

28
00:10:24.789 --> 00:10:31.840
and then the kids ministry is starting right now. So in case um you weren't aware, we've changed

29
00:10:31.849 --> 00:10:39.719

30
00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:46.520

31
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.659

34
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:11.239

35
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.309
worship. And so I want to invite you guys to just stand with me as we would worship and, and gather

36
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.210

37
00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:27.979
that is here today. Thank you for the way that you are with them and with us, no matter what it is

38
00:11:27.989 --> 00:11:34.280
that we are going through. Lord, you are our comfort. You are our guide. You are our protector and

39
00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:44.450
our provider today. You are the one who can mend our hearts and you're the one who can deal with all

40
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:50.929
of our issues, both in the past and present. And you're the one who can map out a glorious future

41
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:58.650
for all of us. Even as things have come to an end, you are always a new beginning. And I pray that

42
00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:05.369
today would be a reminder of, of your faithfulness and your promises to each of us lead this team as

43
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:12.950
they lead us into worship and lead our hearts into a place where we can be instructed by you and

44
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:21.690
receive your advice for the things in our life that can help us to take the next steps. I pray your

45
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:29.229
blessing on every person here today, on their families, the life that they represent and do together.

46
00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:36.989
We are going to rejoice and be glad because this is the day that you have made in Jesus name. We

47
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
pray. Amen. Amen. Let's worship together.

48
00:12:45.609 --> 00:12:52.520
Good morning everybody. It is all about Jesus. That's why we're here. It's so good to see you.

49
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:58.989
Let's worship together. Let's have some fun while we do it right? Cool? Cool.

50
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:14.940
You ask

51
00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:32.270
there's a 10

52
00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:40.540
mhm as it.

53
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:45.969
It's,

54
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.930
this is how I find.

55
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:17.170
Yeah,

56
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.900
this is how a father.

57
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.520
This is our father. This is hard.

58
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:54.910
This is how

59
00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.030
I

60
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.270
this is a

61
00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:35.760
right gone

62
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.010
bad.

63
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.709
It may

64
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.650
in

65
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.050
so.

66
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:29.869
Oh

67
00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:44.680
mhm

68
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.630
Yeah.

69
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:10.219
A

70
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.569
I was stressed.

71
00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:34.660
Yeah. And

72
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:07.000
Jesus we love you. We love you.

73
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:15.739
We know you're here, God. You know every heart in this room, you know what they need and

74
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:25.660
we love you and we just give this time to you. I just wanna encourage everyone stay in this

75
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:32.349
atmosphere and worship with God. It's just you and him and he has something. He wants to speak to

76
00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:38.339
you. He wants to sing over you. He wants to speak to your heart. He loves you.

77
00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:47.089
And we're, we're gonna sing a song about trusting him. And there's lyrics in there that can

78
00:24:47.099 --> 00:24:54.030
sometimes be hard for me to sing sometimes like we're, we're singing about seeking after him. I

79
00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:01.410
sought the Lord and he heard and he answered and sometimes it feels like he's not hearing and we're

80
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:07.829
not getting the answer. So it's really confusing. Why do we sing that he heard and answered when we

81
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:15.510
don't have that answer yet. And there's a delay sometimes between our seeking and the answer we're

82
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:23.339
looking for. There's a delay and the thing that I wanted to read you guys these lyrics, I wrote a

83
00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:29.369
long time ago that don't have a melodies. I will not sing them. But it's, I lay down my right to

84
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:37.619
know all my questions, I give you control. I reach out and take your hand because I want Jesus more

85
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:45.689
than I want to understand. And that's why we seek, that's why we seek him in the mystery when it

86
00:25:45.699 --> 00:25:51.489
doesn't make sense and we don't have the answer we're looking for. He is our answer. So right now,

87
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:58.250
let him be your answer as you sing this to him and open up your mouth and let whatever comes out be

88
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.859
enough and just remind yourself that you're telling your soul what to believe in this season. You're

89
00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:10.020
telling your soul that we trust him, even when it makes no sense. And we don't see the answer we're

90
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:17.280
looking for. We don't hear him yet the way we want to, you're reminding your soul the Bible. It says

91
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:23.680
that we lift up holy hands and this is why I raise my hands all the time in worship. And I know

92
00:26:23.689 --> 00:26:29.449
sometimes it's not comfortable and it's nerve wracking. But I just encourage you if you feel led to

93
00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:35.709
do that, lift your hands to him because it's a physical response that tells your spirit what you're

94
00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:40.510
doing and what you're gonna focus on. When you lift your hands. You are telling your spirit you're

95
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.839
telling your soul, hey, come up where I, where my spirit is, we're gonna do that all together. It's

96
00:26:45.849 --> 00:26:51.329
like come up body, soul and spirit. We're gonna go up and we're gonna surrender to him and worship

97
00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:56.369
him. It's an act of surrender and sometimes it takes that physical act to lead your soul in that

98
00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.000
place no matter what you're going through. So I just encourage you. Sometimes your hands are down

99
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.079
here, sometimes they're up here. Sometimes they go all the way up here for me. But whatever you feel

100
00:27:05.089 --> 00:27:12.069
comfortable for, put your eyes on it and turn your eyes on him because he's here and he loves you.

127
00:33:47.949 --> 00:33:56.560
It's so quiet in here. Oh my. Yeah, I'm just not used to it. You guys are like usually more

128
00:33:56.569 --> 00:34:04.020
noisy and it's weird. It's just, it's just the visuals that aren't working, you know. The rest of us

129
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.229
should still be working.

130
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.830
So I just got some quick announcements for you guys. Um First of all, how many of you made it out to

131
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:21.020
that amazing barbecue yesterday that we had at the park? Wasn't that amazing? Wow.

132
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:30.219
Uh And just in case you thought it was, you know, my planning or my doing, uh I just want to say

133
00:34:30.229 --> 00:34:36.399
that if it wasn't for the Brazilians who did the barbecuing, it would not have been the same.

134
00:34:39.158 --> 00:34:44.878
It was just like next level, next level. It's like everybody was just like, amazed um myself

135
00:34:44.888 --> 00:34:50.218
included. And uh we had such an amazing time and it was supposed to end at three. I think we all

136
00:34:50.229 --> 00:34:56.279
left at like five. So it was just an incredible day. And so if you missed out uh this year, just

137
00:34:56.289 --> 00:35:01.299
make it a point to be there next time we do it. But we've got a lot of events that are happening on

138
00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:05.989
a monthly basis. Uh That was our girls and guys, men's and women's ministry event that we did

139
00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:10.100
together. And then there's gonna be other events that we're gonna be talking to you guys about in

140
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:16.479

144
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.449

145
00:35:38.459 --> 00:35:45.229
they're gonna be amazing. And so it's gonna be great and I just wanna remind everybody that if

177
00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:01.209
something cold and cool to drink at the end of the gathering. It's a great time for us to connect at

178
00:39:01.219 --> 00:39:06.610
the end of each gathering and that's where it's gonna happen at the cafe. So we're gonna move now

179
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:13.310
into the message for uh today and just before we do, it's like take a moment to pray for, for Cathy

180
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.169
and Cathy. Um If you could just wave so that people can see who you are and we just our condolences

181
00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:24.790
uh for Darren's passing. We prayed for him last week and we've been praying for him every day, every

182
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:31.530
week. Um Our staff meeting is always like we're always praying for him and, and uh we're just so sad

183
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:37.239
for you. Um But we know that he's with the Lord and his suffering has come to an end and he fought

184
00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:44.080
an incredible battle. Um And we really thought he had come on the other side of it and then we're so

185
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:49.090
shocked and surprised that the cancer had come back. And I know it's been a difficult and draining

186
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:54.389
time for you and for the family, you know, your daughter and your grandchildren and everybody that's

187
00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:58.899
gone through it. And so we just like to take a moment and pray for you. Can we do that? Is that ok?

188
00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:03.860
Everybody? Would you help me to pray for Cathy? Father? We wanna pray for Cathy and we thank you

189
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:10.209
that Darren is with you, but she's here with you too. And Lord, I know that she needs you. Um She

190
00:40:10.219 --> 00:40:16.280
needs to be comforted by you, strengthened by you. She's just lost her life partner and husband and

191
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:21.590
I just pray, father, you console her in a way that we can't with our words and, and where our

192
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.590
actions would come short. But I pray father that you would have this peace that surpasses all

193
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.669
understanding, just be with her in this moment that she would be enveloped by your love. I know

194
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:40.429
she's surrounded by a loving family and friends and in us, she has a community of faith that has

195
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:48.409
prayed and believed and trusted and continues to do that. And now we direct our, our prayer and our

196
00:40:48.419 --> 00:40:53.879
attention and our focus to Kay and we pray your blessing upon her life right now that you would

197
00:40:53.889 --> 00:41:03.050
continue to strengthen her and be with her in every way. And on the days where she's feeling ok, but on the

198
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:10.090
days, especially when she's not, I pray Father that you would just give her your joy and that should

199
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:18.399
be reminded of your peace. And we pray these things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. We love you Cathy.

200
00:41:19.209 --> 00:41:19.620
Yeah.

201
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:30.879
So we're, we're in a series called Getting There. Um How many of you here feel like you've arrived.

202
00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:41.820
Anybody? No, me neither. II, I feel like I'm so like done with wasting time, but yet I still find a

203
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.360
way to waste it. Anybody else.

204
00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:50.429
I'm, I'm so tired of making mistakes but I don't know, they, they still seem to find me no matter

205
00:41:50.439 --> 00:41:57.000
how well I try to hide. Um, no matter how, how much I think I've changed. I, I realize that there's

206
00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:02.489
still so much work to be done. It's kind of exhausting to just think of how much work still needs to

207
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:08.830
happen in my life. Um, I know you're probably waiting for that day too, for things to change in my

208
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:16.389
life. Thank you for that. Um, but I'm hoping I'm speaking from a place where you can identify with

209
00:42:16.399 --> 00:42:21.840
the work that needs to happen in your own is, is hopefully that's what you're thinking. Yeah, me too

210
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:28.889
and not. Yeah, he really needs to change like I'm just about done with this dude, but sometimes

211
00:42:28.899 --> 00:42:33.860
that's what it feels like. It feels like we're, we're like done with ourselves. I think we can

212
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:43.590
sometimes get to a place where we're so legitimately like, just tired of not being everything that

213
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:53.040
we know we're meant to be. There's this longing within us and this desire to be more and to do more

214
00:42:53.389 --> 00:43:01.010
and, and, and, and, and this belief that we are more that sometimes just makes us just feel so

215
00:43:02.149 --> 00:43:11.000
worthless. And, and I always think God is there a difference between being worthless and being

216
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:11.699
unworthy

217
00:43:13.909 --> 00:43:24.840
because I understand what it feels like to, to feel worthless. But I would much rather feel unworthy

218
00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:34.000
knowing that you're still blessing me. And I, and I, and recognizing that your love and your

219
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:43.479
promises to me make me feel unworthy because I, I identify with all the things that I'm undeserving

220
00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:55.510
of because of who I'm not the way and that you want me to be. And so I, I think that if you're

221
00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:06.010
feeling worthless today, I, I want you to know that that's not God 100% that's not Him. But if

222
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.830
you're feeling unworthy,

223
00:44:09.899 --> 00:44:15.389
I want you to make sure that you match that sense of unworthiness

224
00:44:17.479 --> 00:44:27.919
with the promise of His favor that comes on your life, not because of who you are or who you're not,

225
00:44:28.679 --> 00:44:30.870
but because of who Jesus always is

226
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:39.629
and because of who Jesus is and because of our faith in Him and our trust in him and our wanting to

227
00:44:39.639 --> 00:44:45.669
journey with him and, and, and believing that no matter where we're headed, he's, he's always with

228
00:44:45.679 --> 00:45:00.360
us, he's gonna get us there. And so even if I say, Lord I'm unworthy, I speak these words knowing

229
00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:11.860
that your favor is still upon us, it is still on you. His promises are still there. Uh I, I'm, I'm

230
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:19.360
someone who tries not to get lost, but often I do and, and there are times where I'm intentionally

231
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:26.300
doing everything I can to be focused on the destination. But sometimes I'm looking for directions in

232
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:32.179
a place that is completely unknown to me. And I think when something is completely unknown, it

233
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:39.040
carries with it, a certain measure of anxiety and worry and tension. And sometimes if you're

234
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:44.929
traveling with someone, you're hoping that between the two of you, you can figure out where you're

235
00:45:44.939 --> 00:45:51.260
going, where you're headed, you can hopefully catch the signs that maybe one of you is going to miss,

236
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:57.729
but the other one isn't and, and, and you're leaning on that person so much more and when, and when

237
00:45:57.739 --> 00:46:06.320
you fail and then that person fails, it can sometimes even erupt into an argument, it can erupt into

238
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:13.320
a fight because now neither one of you has been useful to the other person and, and sometimes it

239
00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:20.280
feels like when we're in a relationship with God, it feels like we're not in a useful relationship

240
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:28.379
because we're not getting where we want to get to. And, and there's times in our life when it's not

241
00:46:28.389 --> 00:46:36.540
just that it's unknown, but it's just that everything is new. We've never been here before and, and

242
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:43.909
other times it's because everything just looks the same. And I remember one time we, we had just

243
00:46:43.919 --> 00:46:50.729
recently gotten married and we were moving to this small town right next to the border and my wife

244
00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:56.270
was going to go and finish her master's in New York State. And, and that's why we had picked that

245
00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:03.729
town and we had contacted our landlord and he said, well, you just come to our house and, and, and,

246
00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:09.600
and we can pick up the keys to your place and, and he says, I just want to warn you. It's a little

247
00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:17.409
tricky. It's a lot of fields and you can't miss this turn off. That's like in the middle of the

248
00:47:17.419 --> 00:47:23.300
cornfields because if you miss it, you'll never find our house. And, and I remember like, we're,

249
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:31.800
we're driving in this beat up Volvo and no gps barely have cell phone reception. We just are driving

250
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:37.540
down this dirt road. We don't know where we are. And, and we feel like we're in the movie Children

251
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:46.139
of the Corn. And if you've never seen it, I'm telling you don't, you'll have nightmares for years. I

252
00:47:46.149 --> 00:47:51.949
still can't get that out of my head. And all I could hear was my wife next to me. Just panic. Where

253
00:47:51.959 --> 00:48:00.469
are we? What is this? This is so scary. We can't see anything and I'm like, quiet. I can't miss this

254
00:48:00.479 --> 00:48:08.750
gap in the stupid cornfields. Otherwise we will never find this house. And because our car is so old,

255
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:14.709
the headlights are so dim. You know, when they get all scuffed and scratched up, there's barely any

256
00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:22.110
light coming out of it. Like we can barely see a few feet in front of us. Let alone this turn off in

257
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:28.110
the field that we're never going to find. It seems, I don't know how, but we just put our faith and

258
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:34.250
trust in God in those moments, you just cry out to God. Jesus. May we not die in this field. May we

259
00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:41.760
find the left turn because there is no other way because there's no other signs until finally like

260
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:49.469
we're driving and we see something, we turn down it. It's not it. We come back, get back on the road,

261
00:48:49.479 --> 00:48:55.790
keep going. We finally find something that it might be. It. We're driving down this field that

262
00:48:56.419 --> 00:49:02.810
between corn on either side and we finally start to see what looks like a house down in the distance.

263
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:09.229
We get there, we get the keys. We finally, we made it. But then the problem is we've got to get back

264
00:49:09.239 --> 00:49:16.199
now. It's like you think it's over, but it never is. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's like

265
00:49:16.209 --> 00:49:22.649
there's still now another place to get to and there's yet another challenge in front of you. And so

266
00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:27.780
it's kind of like that in life. It's like every time you think you've gotten it, you've arrived.

267
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:36.679
Well, you still haven't. It's like we're just still trying to get there. And the truth of the matter

268
00:49:36.689 --> 00:49:45.989
is, is that in Exodus chapter 13, there's a story in which they needed to follow the signs out in

269
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:53.149
Exodus 13 in verse 21 it says the Lord went ahead of them, he guided them during the day with a

270
00:49:53.159 --> 00:50:01.129
pillar of cloud. And then it says that he provided light at night with a pillar of fire. And this

271
00:50:01.139 --> 00:50:09.399
allowed them to travel by day or by night. And then the scripture say that and the Lord did not

272
00:50:09.409 --> 00:50:17.909
remove the pillar of cloud or the pillar of fire from its place. And here's the best part, it was

273
00:50:17.919 --> 00:50:25.820
always in front of the people. And I often wonder like, why does it always feel like God isn't

274
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:33.590
leading from the front? And I think that's a me thing and that might be a you thing too because I

275
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:39.830
think our understanding is that God is guiding us. But it also, it often feels like he's just

276
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:46.320
guiding from behind, you know, like my landlord sitting in his living room, waiting for me to show

277
00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:53.300
up to pick up the keys, you know, like like like it's a destination and the only way you're going to

278
00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:59.870
get to the person and to the thing is, is by actually arriving there. But, but the way God always

279
00:50:59.879 --> 00:51:06.830
explains it and describes it in the scriptures is that God only leads one way and that's from the

280
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:14.580
front. See, when I started to understand that I started to change the way I was looking at my life.

281
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:21.750
It started to change the way that I was looking at his guidance. It started to change the way I was

282
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:28.560
looking at signs and the wonders he'd bring into my life. I started to understand that that God is a

283
00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:38.550
God who always leads from the front. He goes before us, always before us, always in front of us.

284
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:48.229
He has to be in the front. And so then I realized that I'm either following God or I'm just going by

285
00:51:48.239 --> 00:51:49.010
myself.

286
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:58.040
I'm making my own way, but I'm not following him and his way. And I had to make that shift in my

287
00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:02.949
mind and in my heart. And then all of a sudden when the moment that I did that, all of a sudden,

288
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.790
God's signs started to become more clear. The Bible says that there are six things that we can count

289
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:18.389
on when it comes to signs and guidance. The Bible says that that God was so clear for His people

290
00:52:18.399 --> 00:52:26.399
that he made sure that he was always up and in front of them that they always knew where He was at

291
00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:33.610
all times. There was never any confusion about this. He made it so clear that he was either a cloud

292
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:44.159
by day or fire by night. And he provided a contrast in the sky at all times so that he could never

293
00:52:44.169 --> 00:52:52.750
be confused with just any random cloud and he could never be confused with any random light. He had

294
00:52:52.760 --> 00:53:05.129
to stand apart and anything that would question his uniqueness, it was clear, this was not God and

295
00:53:05.139 --> 00:53:12.810
he is not to be followed. And yet we live our lives always trying to figure out what the signs of

296
00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:20.219
God are you ever noticed that? Like, we're always confused about that. It's like, is this God or is

297
00:53:20.229 --> 00:53:26.850
this God was this you Lord or was this just like bad Chinese food?

298
00:53:29.679 --> 00:53:36.209
Like why did I dream this? Like what happened here? God, no offense to the Chinese or the food. But

299
00:53:36.219 --> 00:53:42.419
I love Chinese food, but I just felt like I didn't wanna attack pizza this morning. I just,

300
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:50.550
but the idea is that we sometimes look at what we're going through and we're confused by anybody

301
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:56.510
else, like we're just not sure. And we're saying, is this a sign that I'm to follow? Is this

302
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.419
something that I'm supposed to do? But why are we so confused all the time? And I started to

303
00:54:02.429 --> 00:54:09.500
recognize and realize that what God does for his people is that He makes himself unmistakably known.

304
00:54:11.399 --> 00:54:18.659
And so here's what I've come to understand if God hasn't made himself abundantly clear, then it's

305
00:54:18.669 --> 00:54:19.929
probably not God

306
00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:34.090
and I got to stop making things that aren't God. God's guidance. See, the problem isn't that God

307
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:39.969
hasn't been clear. The problem is I'm just trying to see God in places where he's not leading me to

308
00:54:39.979 --> 00:54:46.489
places where he's not leading me, me having to kind of talk to people and spiritualize events and,

309
00:54:47.189 --> 00:54:53.919
and situations and circumstances and signs and telling people that God is with me and guiding me

310
00:54:53.929 --> 00:55:00.669
when He's, he's not doing that at all. You see, II, I find that we struggle with that because we

311
00:55:00.679 --> 00:55:07.479
feel like it's easier for us to say where God is than to say that He still hasn't made it clear

312
00:55:07.689 --> 00:55:18.409
where He's actually truly is and where He's actually leading me. And we can't have a problem with

313
00:55:18.419 --> 00:55:24.699
that. We can't have a problem with that because in the scriptures, it says that there are six

314
00:55:24.709 --> 00:55:30.540
unmistakable ways that we can know the first is always through His word. And it's always shocking to

315
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:35.679
me that people who need guidance the most are never reading the scriptures or even listening to it

316
00:55:35.689 --> 00:55:40.189
today. You don't even have to read it anymore. You just gotta listen, lie there, just let somebody

317
00:55:40.199 --> 00:55:43.889
else read it. Even in Morgan Freeman's voice, you can listen to it,

318
00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:52.590
you can pick anybody you want and you just listen to the word in that voice. You can hear it in a

319
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:59.550
Scottish accent. If you want, you can, you can just do it in a woman's voice because maybe that

320
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:05.479
resonates more. It doesn't matter. You can just listen to it. And it's just shocking to me that

321
00:56:05.489 --> 00:56:11.100
today people who are needing guidance and, and, and, and needing help and trying to understand what

322
00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:17.600
the next thing is. Never spend time with God's word. Here's what I know God when he wants to tell

323
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:21.850
you something is going to speak through his word and he's going to keep confirming it through his

324
00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:26.800
word. You're not gonna hear it just once you're gonna hear it twice, you're gonna hear it three

325
00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:32.830
times. It's like every time you open the word of God, it's gonna say the same thing again in a

326
00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:40.840
different place with a different person. But it's always God speaking to you through his word. The

327
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:46.810
second thing that he does is that he always has the ability to speak to us audibly. And it's a voice

328
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:53.840
that, that supersedes any voice that is your own. It's not your inner voice. It's a voice that God

329
00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:59.800
just transcends every other voice. It's not Satan's voice, it's not the world's voice. It's not a

330
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:06.649
person's voice. It's not a, a traumatic voice from the past or even a wise person's voice from the

331
00:57:06.659 --> 00:57:13.360
present. It's a voice that stands apart and the Bible says that his voice is like the sound of many

332
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:20.919
rushing waters. And when you hear God's voice, it stands apart and you know, this is not you, this

333
00:57:20.929 --> 00:57:28.260
is God speaking to you. Sometimes God actually speaks to you through other people. It's like you

334
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:34.010
have a moment where not only they have said something that they possibly couldn't have known, but

335
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:42.409
sometimes he uses the people that you most dislike in the world to say it. He can use anyone and

336
00:57:42.419 --> 00:57:49.719
thing to speak to us, not just audibly but through people, whether we love them, respect them,

337
00:57:49.729 --> 00:57:56.449
whether we trust them or whether we don't, it doesn't matter. God can use that. And then he says

338
00:57:56.459 --> 00:58:02.889
that he can also do it through dreams and visions. He could speak to us when we're asleep. Because

339
00:58:02.899 --> 00:58:10.229
when we're awake, sometimes our minds are just too busy, they're just too caught up in the things

340
00:58:10.239 --> 00:58:16.489
that we're going through for us to be able to truly pay attention to what God wants to say. And then

341
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:24.389
sometimes it's just an inner knowing. The Bible says that there is a certainty within us that even

342
00:58:24.399 --> 00:58:31.580
if we can't explain it, we just know that we know that we know has anyone ever felt that it's like

343
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:36.510
there was just no way to describe it to someone else. There was nothing else other than just that

344
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:44.350
certainty that you just knew this was it. And sometimes it comes in the form of having to make a

345
00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:50.179
choice and you're like, I don't know what to choose. And then all of a sudden, you just know

346
00:58:52.729 --> 00:59:00.110
and it's not a choice anymore. It's just obedience. And I love it when God moves us away from a

347
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:07.330
place where it's us trying to figure things out and us obeying Him. Instead. You see, I, I want us

348
00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:14.479
to understand what God does in leading us and guiding us and trying to get us. There is that at, at

349
00:59:14.489 --> 00:59:20.209
some point it's no longer about choosing, it's just about obeying. That's why he leads from the

350
00:59:20.219 --> 00:59:25.770
front. You see, you have to get to this place where you say God, I don't, I don't want this to be a

351
00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:32.050
choice anymore. A choice that I get to make in my free will and that you maybe have to fix along the

352
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:38.229
way that, that my detours can, can somehow still end up in being my destination. Lord, I don't want

353
00:59:38.239 --> 00:59:43.870
to do it that way. What I want to do is I want to obey you instead. Can we move away from a place

354
00:59:43.879 --> 00:59:50.439
where we're just making decisions to a place where we are followers of Jesus wanting to live in

355
00:59:50.449 --> 00:59:56.750
obedience. You see the reason God wants to lead from the front is because when God leads from the

356
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:03.610
front, all you have to do is follow God. It's not about the decisions you're making anymore. It's

357
01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:10.080
about obeying to the God who's already gone before you, who is in front of you, who's bringing you

358
01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:18.250
to the place that he knows is the best place for you. And so it doesn't make it about decisions

359
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:25.679
anymore. It makes it all about obedience. And I want to get to that place where it's not about the

360
01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:32.300
decisions. It's about the obedience first and foremost. But you know, often we're just always living

361
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:39.050
in that place of decision making instead of transitioning into that place of pure obedience and

362
01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:47.979
letting God lead from the front and look what it says in Exodus 14 24. Uh but just before dawn, it

363
01:00:47.989 --> 01:00:56.020
says, the Lord looked down on the Egyptian army just as they had left uh Egypt, right from the start.

364
01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:02.229
It's amazing to see that God is leading them. So when, when Moses leads them into the desert, uh the

365
01:01:02.239 --> 01:01:08.979
cloud and the fire appear immediately. It's with them as soon as they leave Egypt and, and, and, and

366
01:01:08.989 --> 01:01:13.899
a lot of us don't know this but, and I'm not sure why, but maybe it's because it, it's not depicted

367
01:01:13.909 --> 01:01:21.260
in the movie probably. But if we read it all of a sudden, we see that there is a pillar of fire and

368
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:27.020
cloud and look at this, he threw their forces into total confusion. So as the Egyptians were

369
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:36.820
following, what is God doing? He's throwing them into confusion and how is he doing it with his

370
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:42.820
presence? And so I don't know if you get this, but God doesn't just lead from the front. God

371
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:52.770
protects us on the journey. Yeah. He protects you and whoever is pursuing you as you're following.

372
01:01:52.780 --> 01:02:01.030
God. God is going to throw them into confusion so that you stay protected. Isn't that beautiful?

373
01:02:02.169 --> 01:02:07.929
You're protected on the journey. God is protecting you. So God not only protects you, but look at

374
01:02:07.939 --> 01:02:14.560
what it says in numbers nine verse 21 it says sometimes the cloud stayed, only look at this

375
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:21.389
overnight and then it lifted the next morning, but day or night when the cloud lifted, then the

376
01:02:21.399 --> 01:02:28.149
people broke camp and then they moved on. And then whenever the cloud stayed above the Tabernacle

377
01:02:28.159 --> 01:02:36.600
for like two days a month or a year. Look at this, the people of Israel stayed in camp and they did

378
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:42.739
not move. And but as soon as it lifted, they broke camp and they moved on.

379
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:51.590
And so they camped and they traveled at the Lord's command and they did whatever the Lord told them

380
01:02:51.600 --> 01:03:01.030
through Moses. And so what we see here is that when God moved, the people moved, they didn't move

381
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.679
until God moved. And it said sometimes they would just stay there overnight. Sometimes it would be

382
01:03:06.689 --> 01:03:14.409
two days, sometimes it'd be a week, sometimes God wouldn't move for an entire year.

383
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:28.209
And yet I see such anxiety in us as followers of Jesus, I see such worry and concern when in the

384
01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:33.070
scriptures. It's clear, sometimes God did not move for an entire year

385
01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:47.659
and and then till God moved, that everyone was not to move. When God moved, then everybody broke

386
01:03:47.669 --> 01:03:56.540
camp and moved because God only leads from the front. And when he leads from the front, he protects

387
01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:01.139
you from the enemies at the rear. And when God stops

388
01:04:03.189 --> 01:04:11.620
for the night, it's because it's not safe to travel at night. When he moves in the day, it's because

389
01:04:11.629 --> 01:04:20.429
you can travel by day. But sometimes he wouldn't move during the day. He would only let them move at

390
01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:31.000
night and he would repeat this over and over again. God didn't just appear in the night. So they

391
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:40.340
would have light. He also would appear day and night when it was time to move. You see God's

392
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:48.489
presence provides guidance, it provides comfort, but it above all also provides safety for us as we

393
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:54.340
travel. Why do you want to move during the day when God is telling you to stay put? Why do you want

394
01:04:54.350 --> 01:05:00.250
to move at night? When God is telling you this is not the time to move. See when God moves, he's

395
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:07.629
protecting us both day and night. He's protecting us from the front leading us to where we need to

396
01:05:07.639 --> 01:05:13.340
go. But he's also protecting us from the rear, from the enemies that are pursuing us, from the

397
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:19.510
enemies that are in front of us and from those that we're leaving behind, you, see, God is always

398
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:29.739
with us. And in the book of Nehemiah, it says this in chapter nine verse 19. It says because of your

399
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:38.449
great compassion, it says you did not abandon them in the wilderness by day. The pillar of cloud did

400
01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:44.399
not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way that they

401
01:05:44.409 --> 01:05:50.149
were to take. It says that you gave your good spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your man

402
01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:57.290
from your, from their mouths. You gave them water for their thirst and for 40 years, you sustained

403
01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:03.689
them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing and their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet

404
01:06:03.699 --> 01:06:11.399
ever become swollen. You know why Nehemiah praised this? Because He's reminding us that we can pray

405
01:06:11.409 --> 01:06:20.159
the promises of God. He, that we can say that the promises of God remain the same. He's able to do

406
01:06:20.169 --> 01:06:26.350
this because any and every time that we look in the scriptures, whatever God did, guess what we can

407
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:33.649
call on that story and make it our own. Are you ready to make this story yours? And to say, Lord,

408
01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:40.709
the way that you were faithful, you're gonna be faithful again, the way you led by the front, the

409
01:06:40.719 --> 01:06:45.709
way that you were always visible, the way that you were always clear, the way that you made things

410
01:06:45.719 --> 01:06:51.949
always known. Isn't it amazing that God can still do that today? Well, this is what Nehemiah does.

411
01:06:51.959 --> 01:06:58.520
Nehemiah faces a great challenge. He has to rebuild the walls. And he's receiving a attack from all

412
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:06.209
sides because no one wants him to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. And Nehemiah is facing conflicts

413
01:07:06.219 --> 01:07:12.969
and trouble and problems, not just from external forces. He's facing it internally, within the walls,

414
01:07:12.979 --> 01:07:17.929
from the workers and from the people. And he doesn't have the resources and sometimes they just

415
01:07:17.939 --> 01:07:23.020
don't want to work. Sometimes they're afraid and they're paying attention more to rumors than they

416
01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:28.580
are to truth. And there are so many instances in which the enemy tries to take out Nehemiah

417
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:36.469
altogether. And yet through all of this, Nehemiah keeps saying, Lord bless the work of my hands

418
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:44.280
through all of this. He says God in the same way that you were present and faithful for all those

419
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:54.169
years leading your people by the cloud and by the fire. Can you do that again for me? Can you pray

420
01:07:54.179 --> 01:08:01.639
that for yourself today? Where is it that you need the cloud? Where is it that you need the fire?

421
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:10.040
Where is it that you need God to lead you from the front? Are, are you waiting for something to

422
01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:19.080
change in our economy before things get better for you? Are you waiting for a job opportunity to be

423
01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:29.319
better than the one you have? Are you waiting for a partner? A boyfriend, a girlfriend who becomes a

424
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:36.180
husband or a wife? Are, are you waiting for someone or something? Instead of letting God lead you

425
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:43.549
from the front? You see any time you let something else lead you, you are not following the cloud,

426
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:51.370
you are not following the fire. You're following your desire, you're following your want, you're

427
01:08:51.379 --> 01:08:58.759
following a belief in a system and you're believing in a world instead of putting all of your faith

428
01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:07.270
and trust in the guidance of God. You see when you make this shift, you stop depending, believing

429
01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:15.939
and relying on the events of this world to be different for you. And you realize that wherever you

430
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:22.529
need to be, let out of whatever you need to be led towards whatever victory you need to have in this

431
01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:33.200
life. God can give it to you because that's what God does. He leads you into His promises, believe

432
01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:40.180
that for yourself today, put your faith and trust in God believe that He is leading your decisions,

433
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.049
but do it

434
01:09:44.068 --> 01:09:52.008
by obedience, obedience to God, leading all the way God bless you. Thank you so much.

435
01:09:55.549 --> 01:09:55.979
Mhm

436
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:10.799
Let's pray. Can we do that together as we take this time? Would you stand please? Thank you, Father.

437
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:15.810
I thank you for every person here and the guidance that you wanna provide them the way you want to

438
01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:23.000
lead them and bless them, the amazing things you wanna do in their life. Father, I thank you for

439
01:10:23.009 --> 01:10:27.680
each person here today and, and for the way that you are leading them from the front, you're

440
01:10:27.689 --> 01:10:32.970
protecting them from their enemies. You, you are providing for them. Along the way, you're giving

441
01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:39.640
them the comfort that they need. You're making yourself clear and known and they're moving when

442
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:47.100
you're moving. God. Lord, we want to always bring your promises to fulfillment through whatever

443
01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:54.629
means possible, but you don't need help with that. What you want from us is obedience. You, you want

444
01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.049
us to obey you. And if you tell us to do something, then we need to do it. If there's an action for

445
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:13.279
us to make, then, then we'll act. But lord, we saw that you would rest for a day overnight for weeks

446
01:11:13.689 --> 01:11:19.299
or even a year at a time. And lord, we look to that and we say God, what are you telling us to do in

447
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:27.029
the situation of our life right now? And may we obey you to experience the blessing that you have in

448
01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:35.700
store for us? And we pray these things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thanks for being with me today.

449
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.149
And I just pray that we would be blessed by this last song as we would hear it together. And um

450
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.859
let's just take this opportunity to just let this uh sink in and to experience the blessing of God

451
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:50.879
as we would worship together. Would you welcome the river's edge worship team once again?

452
01:12:03.509 --> 01:12:07.419
Let's respond to this song and it's uh

453
01:12:11.129 --> 01:12:16.160
let's try something out, whatever. I don't know what you guys are going through, but I think

454
01:12:16.169 --> 01:12:23.709
everybody's got something but whatever it says call in the name of the Lord and you will be saved,

455
01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.209
right? We know that He's with us, always day and night. Mountains and valleys transition.

456
01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:41.439
Let's say just say this out loud. God is with me louder. God is with me a little louder. Come on,

457
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:47.490
God is with you. Can you say amen? God is with us. His presence is with us. He is for us. He is

458
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:52.700
before us. Nothing goes without him. And uh let's just respond with this song.

474
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:11.859
We're not done. Are we done? I mean, what do you guys want to sing? Song requests? Which one?

475
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:20.729
Keep it moving. Do it, keep it moving?
