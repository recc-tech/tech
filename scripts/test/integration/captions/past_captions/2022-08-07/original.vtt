1
00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.070
well. Hello and welcome. We're so glad that you could be a part of our community of faith today and

2
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.000
that you have taken time out of your busy life and schedule to be here present in the house probably

3
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.460
one of the hottest Sundays of the year. And so we'll do our very best to keep it just as hot in here

4
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:19.730
as it is out there. Um, count on us on being consistent in every possible way. But we are so glad

5
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:27.170
that we are beginning a new series today called the genius of jesus, the man who changed everything

6
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:36.020
and it's based off the book by Erwin McManus and he is um are in many ways our lead pastor, he's in

7
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.930
Los Angeles and mosaic L. A. Is a partner church with us and we are so glad that we can be here

8
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:51.630
together to embark on the journey to your genius Week one of this incredible series that begins

9
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:58.860
today and we're going to be learning some key principles and how we can make that possible in our

10
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.570
lives. Well, we also want to let you know that if this is your first week with us and and if you

11
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.920
weren't aware of this, you already belong. That this is a place where you can belong before you

12
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.560
believe that you can come as you are. But you could also expect to leave loved, accepted, inspired

13
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:26.610
and encouraged. That's why we always say it's okay not to be okay because God accepts you just the

14
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:34.970
way you are and he is also ready to do something new in your life and today is another day in which

15
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:42.330
he wants to do exactly that. But we're going to begin this gathering with a song and that first song

16
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:48.600
that we are going to hear is called Miracle. Would you stand with me as we would sing this song

17
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:55.770
together and would you welcome the river's edge team today as they would lead us in worship and as

18
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:02.960
we would sing this song together so Father bless this time and this worship to you in jesus name

19
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.650
amen

20
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.710
upon the open.

21
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.240
The sea was calm with just

22
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.700

You may be seated. Awesome.

92
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.750
Wow. Thank you. Worship team. That was amazing. And I just want to share some quick announcements

93
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:52.120
with you just before we begin the week one into the journey to your genius. And the first is that we

94
00:23:52.120 --> 00:24:00.070
have a community kitchen leader in Kathleen and the last week that we were just in um she was able

95
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:06.830
to begin to meet with not only the people like yourselves who have signed up and who have

96
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:15.750
volunteered but to put a plan together. And already that plan is coming together in that not only

97
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:23.540
have people just made themselves available to help in in in a number of ways, but also for the way

98
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:30.500
that donate Nations for equipment have been coming in and so God is already blessing and honoring

99
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:38.920
that ministry. We were in the past able to feed 200 people per week and we lost our leader who was

100
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:47.160
driving that for the past nine some years and we are so blessed that God has brought us back a new

101
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:55.170
leader in Kathleen. Can we just thank the Lord for that and and for how this ministry is going to

102
00:24:55.170 --> 00:25:02.540
continue to change lives. Um And the second thing I'd like to do is to talk to you about the four

103
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:08.610
ways that you can give and the right here up on the screen you can choose any one of those. Any way

104
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:13.960
that you would like to make a contribution. It would be greatly appreciated. At the end of the

105
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.560
gathering we always have an opportunity to hang out at our cafe. You guys can ask for anything you

106
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:27.530
like there. Um it has to be under I think $5. No there's no price limit. But um if you ask for I

107
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.940
don't know your Bitcoin. We don't have those. We have we have espresso. You have different types of

108
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.110
coffee and teas and hot chocolate. We have different things that you can request but a down payment

109
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:43.810
on your first house, we cannot provide that. But in terms of refreshments we do have that. You can

110
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:50.180
definitely enjoy all of that at your discretion at the end of the gathering. That's an opportunity

111
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.920
for me to also get to say hi to you. So if we don't know each other, then just drop by say hello and

112
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.470
I'd love for you to do that. And if you haven't already and you haven't had an opportunity to sign

113
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.860
up on our website uh to be a part of our community that you can do so here in person. You just gotta

114
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:13.420
fill out a simple card and we'll be in touch with you after uh that, well we have no kids program

115
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:19.820
during the month of august. I know that sucks, especially if you brought kids with you and even more

116
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:26.700
if you have kids. But um, but it's just the fact that we have to give our teachers a break too and

117
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.060
we're in a few weeks, we're also going to give our coffee team a break because everyone deserves a

118
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:39.040
break during the summer. Don't you agree? Yes, of course. Yeah, I know that wasn't heartfelt, but

119
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:46.550
thank you anyways and we just like to be served, but we don't like to give people who serve a break.

120
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:54.260
So we need to do both of those things. Um, and do them well. And so today it's gonna be a great

121
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.980
opportunity for us to just connect, so make sure you do that at the end. And so let's begin our

122
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:07.310
series today, which is called the genius of jesus, the man who changed everything. And today's week

123
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:12.880
one and it's called the Journey to your genius. Let's just take a look and we'll begin

124
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:41.880
for those of you that don't know this. We have been unofficially apart of mosaic in Los Angeles for

125
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:49.310
about 20 years and we are now formalizing that relationship and we are so glad to be a part of that

126
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:56.700
community of faith and to be a part of what God is doing, not just in Los Angeles, but what he's

127
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:04.380
doing in Seattle what he's doing in different parts of California, what he's doing in Mexico city,

128
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:10.080
what he's doing in Ecuador and now what God is going to be doing in Montreal. And so this series

129
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.980
that we are in called the genius of jesus. The journey to your genius is about what it takes for us

130
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:25.660
to unlock that potential within all of us. I know that many of us in this room have not always had a

131
00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:40.290
positive experience with someone who has either seen or put down the potential that we have in our

132
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:47.530
lives. Sometimes people build this up and sometimes they tear us down, sometimes they have something

133
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:55.260
positive to say it, sometimes they just don't. Sometimes the people that we expect to be the most

134
00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:04.570
open and enthusiastic and the most encouraging are sometimes the people who are not like that at all,

135
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:12.170
I don't know about you, but I remember a experience in elementary school when I was asked in grade

136
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:19.040
six and it was our graduating class, we were gonna be going into junior high or high school grade

137
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:28.550
seven and our teacher asked us each one by one what career path we wanted to take what we wanted to

138
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:37.450
be. And and since I was a little boy, my dad who was a builder who had built quite a bit in in his

139
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:45.740
career in construction in Montreal was always pushing me to become his architect. And so when my

140
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.180
turn came around, the teacher said Lorenzo, what do you want to be? And I said, an architect because

141
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:58.050
that's what my father told me I had to be. I didn't have a choice. Um that's what he wanted me to be,

142
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:05.630
that's what I had to be. And so he said, I said that and then my teacher said uh no you won't. That

143
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:10.610
was like her first reaction. And the worst part is that she didn't say anything to anybody else.

144
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:17.800
That was the only person in the class who she had said this to. So obviously she saw some form of

145
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:27.370
structured failure in my life, she saw something in me that others had obviously also possibly seen

146
00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.940
but had not vocalized in that moment in my life, in that moment where I thought, you know, she was

147
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.730
just going to move on to the next kid or say something nice about what I had just said, I heard the

148
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:47.450
words that would forever define me in terms of wanting to prove myself. And interestingly enough in

149
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:58.070
that moment instead of me just letting a drop, I just said as loud as I could, yes, I will. And then

150
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:08.000
she repeated no you won't. And it became this thing between myself and my grade six teacher where

151
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.370
she was saying no, you won't and I was saying yes, I will

152
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.530
until I got sent to the principal's office. And then that was the end of the conversation, which to

153
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:25.490
be honest, I had been there many times before which was probably why she was saying something to

154
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:35.700
that effect. However, it pushed me and drove me to then figure out what it was I did want to do and

155
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:43.940
what it was that I wanted to become. I sometimes wonder back to that moment, are we structured for

156
00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:53.940
failure? Is there something in me that is propelling me towards failure instead of success? And was

157
00:31:53.940 --> 00:32:01.180
there something in me on that day that my teacher saw that I obviously was blind to or ignorant to

158
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:08.660
or refuse to acknowledge and that even though I was insistent and resistant, it didn't change the

159
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:15.590
fact that there were things that I had obviously shown her during the course of a year that told her

160
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:22.970
that I was going to fail. We don't always pay attention to those things. We can sometimes rail

161
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:30.570
against them with all of our strength and feel like we can somehow overcome and still be successful.

162
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:37.680
But what if there are structures within us that need to be demolished so that we can experience the

163
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:49.720
success that we ultimately desire to have? The genius of jesus is that he wants to restructure the

164
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:59.660
universe of our life within us. Now, all of us have a life and all of us have been living that life

165
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:06.130
and some things have been chosen and other things have been imposed and some of those things have

166
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:13.090
formed us and shaped us to become who we are today. But there is something that jesus wants to do

167
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:20.310
that ultimately we have to be open enough to have him do and we may not be ready for that. Maybe

168
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:27.000
we're too early in this journey. Maybe this jesus thing isn't where we're at just yet, but it

169
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.730
doesn't change his intent. His desire is nonetheless to restructure that universe that we call life

170
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:47.990
within us. Now, when we think of this life, we think of what it brings to us and not so much what we

171
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:56.890
shape with it. In fact, when you have conversations with people, they'll always talk to you about

172
00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.310
the life that is happening rather than the life that they are shaping.

173
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:14.480
And what Jesus does is that he comes into our life so that we stop having this crazy narrative where

174
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:24.120
we are deceiving ourselves that life is happening to us instead of us being able to shape it. The

175
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:30.840
future isn't just something waiting for us. It is something that every day we can make decisions

176
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:40.830
about to create and what God is enabling us to understand is how to actually make that happen. And

177
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:49.950
so what jesus does is that he reveals principles that do a few things and these few things are

178
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:59.790
incredibly meaningful. They are of great substance. They are life altering. They reshape the

179
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.300
universe that is your life

180
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.430
the first is that he reshapes your compass.

181
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:20.470
I still remember early in my childhood, my geography class where we got to play with the compass for

182
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:30.320
the first time where we got to look at a topographical map and and figure out what direction the

183
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.370
compass would lead us to and and and the teacher would give us clues on that map and we would have

184
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:43.290
to find it with the compass by looking at the map to this day. I've never struggled with direction.

185
00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:51.990
That's so not true. It's the opposite. I loved that class, but my nickname should be U turn knott's.

186
00:35:51.990 --> 00:36:02.100
Oh, for whatever reason, I tend to just drive off in a direction only to realize that it's the wrong

187
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:15.500
way. I once got on and got off a highway Four times When I was in my early teens like 17, 18, 19. I

188
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.010
remember in that span where where we were going to a concert and and I kept getting on and off the

189
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:28.100
highway. But going in the wrong direction, I missed the place. We almost missed the entire concert.

190
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:33.640
And it was because I was driving and didn't have a clue what direction east or west was

191
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:41.210
interestingly enough, God doesn't want to just shape the direction of your life. He wants to help

192
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:49.790
you to have what we have understood to be a moral compass. And I think of how he wants to shape our

193
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:59.530
character so that he can increase our capacity so that we can be the champion in this life that he

194
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:11.510
has desired us to become, I don't know if you see the progression here, but for my character to be

195
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:21.960
changed, I I need to know the direction and, and, and for my character to be impacted, I have to be

196
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.770
able to go towards the right thing and I'm not gonna be able to do that to then see my capacity

197
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:33.900
increase. And so what jesus does is when he talks about restructuring our life so that we're no

198
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:43.000
longer geared towards failure, but a better version of success, a new definition of it. He says, I'm

199
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.860
going to help you with your compass, your character, I'm going to increase your capacity and I'm

200
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.450
going to make you a champion

201
00:37:53.950 --> 00:38:01.580
and I look at what jesus has done in our lives and in many of our lives so far and I can see that

202
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:08.690
that the genius of jesus is that he just simply wants you to discover your personal genius, what you

203
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:15.330
were put on this earth for. And I've heard people kind of lament the fact that can we just finally

204
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:22.150
just stop talking about intention and purpose, people are tired of hearing this word, it's become so

205
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:31.650
gimmicky. Uh one of the things that I do uh in my life is I'm a pro sports chaplain and and life

206
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:37.860
coach and I get to work with all the professional teams in the city and that gives me access to

207
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:44.700
players and management and locker rooms and, and and and games and all that that comes with that.

208
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:56.930
But what it doesn't do is that it doesn't make me a better known personality in the city. What it

209
00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:07.020
doesn't do is it doesn't increase my capacity to build my brand or to build my stardom. What it does

210
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:15.580
is that it gives me an opportunity to serve people in places that many people just don't have access

211
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:27.350
to. It makes me a servant in a different context, not a star. And so when we understand this, then

212
00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:35.260
we understand that that jesus all along has been helping me not to become an athlete, but he has

213
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:45.160
helped me to become a servant to athletes, to help them in their spiritual journey. When I thought I

214
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:53.880
would become an athlete and be on those fields or on that court, I now realize that what God was

215
00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:02.590
doing was that he was building me into a person who would help those who would be, I didn't know

216
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:11.600
that. At first I didn't understand that. But God helped me clarify things with my compass and he

217
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:19.930
worked in my character and then he increased my capacity and then he redefined what a champion would

218
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:27.880
look like for me. And I want you to understand that when we're on this journey individually. God

219
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:36.560
does the same thing. He wants to help you to discover that genius and, and, and and the geniuses

220
00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:45.270
that you get to reshape every environment that you're in, and and it doesn't matter what it is that

221
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:55.480
you do or what field you're in or what you have access to. However is incredibly important. That

222
00:40:55.490 --> 00:41:06.690
sphere of influence is where God wants you to express your genius and it is in that environment that

223
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:13.860
you are going to be able to do exactly that. And so if we were to break this down in terms of

224
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:23.910
understanding this word, genius that we've been using a lot, it's I think a level of human capacity

225
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:34.530
that changed our understanding of human creativity and so a person came along and did things so

226
00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:42.240
radically different that everybody looks at this person and says they're a genius because that

227
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:51.500
became the new standard by which life now is understood, we understood it this way until this person

228
00:41:51.500 --> 00:42:00.390
came along and gave us a brand new definition of that. And so genius is when our understanding of

229
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:09.870
things is now based on their discovery on what they were able to accomplish. We now see and

230
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:17.930
understand the world this way And and a prodigy is is someone that when we look at someone who's

231
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:25.700
really young in age, we say it's impossible that this person at their age would be able to have this

232
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:33.970
ability or this experience to be able to accomplish this because if it takes 10,000 hours for a

233
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:41.720
person to practice at something to become an expert in it. We look at someone like a prodigy and say

234
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.380
they didn't have 10,000 hours. They didn't even have 10 days in some, in some cases. They didn't even

235
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:54.750
have 10 weeks, no one even sat down and taught them the subject matter, but look, they're teaching

236
00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:04.010
us, they are a prodigy. Has anyone ever looked at you and said you were a genius? Has anyone ever

237
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:12.340
looked at you and said you're a prodigy? I know that that has happened in my life, like probably

238
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.940
daily when I talk to myself

239
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:26.110
and that's about it, no one has ever told me those things. So if I don't tell myself, I don't walk

240
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:33.170
around feeling very smart or feel like a genius or feeling like a prodigy, because the reality of my

241
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:42.940
life shows in most cases a structure for failure rather than success. How about you? And in the

242
00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:49.430
journey that I'm in God has been reshaping that and redefining that and helping me to better

243
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:57.480
understand that. There's something about being a prodigy that was identified early in Jesus's life.

244
00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:03.220
Now we don't know a lot about his life before he turns 30, but we do have moments in which the

245
00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:10.490
scriptures give us insight into his prodigious life. In fact, in Luke chapter two, if we can just

246
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:16.310
read these verses from 40 to um Sorry, from 20, where is that?

247
00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:28.310
What did I do? I messed up the scriptures, that's what I did, Can we go 24-29? And if you can't find

248
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:37.690
it? It's okay. Here's what I'm gonna do Um we're not gonna be able to read it. So 24-29 and The

249
00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:47.370
verse that we're about to read is a story of when Mary and Joseph are traveling with Jesus and they

250
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:54.260
lose him now. What's interesting about this story and I think it's actually pretty hilarious that

251
00:44:54.270 --> 00:45:01.880
that day the spirit led him to the temple. So when Mary and Joseph came, sorry could we what we got

252
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.320
there? Now you're at the right verse actually 27 was better.

253
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:13.560
I'm sorry Christina. Uh So the spirit led him to the temple. So when mary and joseph came to present

254
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:20.970
the baby, jesus to the Lord as the law required, Simeon was there and he took the child in his arms

255
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:28.790
and praised God saying sovereign Lord. Now let your servant die in peace as you have promised. They

256
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:37.250
were gonna stop there. Let's we'll stop. And so jesus at his birth is presented at the temple and

257
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:45.140
someone is there to mark that moment. And in that moment Jesus is called a prodigy in that moment of

258
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:52.820
his birth. He's a prodigy. The next moment we see is when Jesus is now 12 years old and he is no

259
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:59.230
longer with his parents? And his parents only notice one day later. Now have you ever lost anything

260
00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:09.640
like your keys anybody ever ever lost? Like your phone? An ipad, something like that right? Like

261
00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.820
something that of importance and value to you? I think we all have. Has anyone here ever lost a kid?

262
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:26.090
Okay. I have I lost my son at a at a car show thank god for lexis because that's where he was.

263
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:38.140
I found him at Lexus, I was at cadillac and I lost him and but Lexus found him and that day reminded

264
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:47.820
me of of how I can lose sight for a moment and that's all it would take for my three year old son to

265
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:55.630
just be gone and in that moment I became so afraid to ever have that happen again that it only

266
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.370
happened one more time after that

267
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:08.810
and then that's it just happened twice, lost my kid twice but I never lost him for a day now when

268
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:14.930
God was choosing parents who chose mary and joseph and he and he made this incredible choice where

269
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:22.100
to this day no one is revered more than mary come on, we prayed to mary sometimes we believe in mary,

270
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.740
we we asked for her protection but mary lost their kid

271
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:37.790
and not for a minute for a day and then they had to travel back and then they found him at the

272
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:45.600
temple and when they walk up to jesus and they say jesus like why didn't you like answer your phone

273
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:54.890
when we called you that may not be in the scriptures? What happened in that moment was that Jesus

274
00:47:54.890 --> 00:48:04.420
says, where else would I be? But in my father's house now in that moment, Jesus does something, he

275
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:12.040
answers their question with a question which In the 70s would have gotten me in an old school

276
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:12.710
beating

277
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:26.360
to this day, you know, I still remember those beatings, I couldn't talk back like that, and what

278
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:35.530
Jesus does is that he reveals his prodigy, he reveals his genius by answering a question with a

279
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:46.040
question because he's helping each of us yet to a deeper meeting and the genius of jesus is not the

280
00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:47.980
answers he provides.

281
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:54.780
The genius of jesus is that he astonishes us still to this day with his questions

282
00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:07.270
that when he asks those questions, it reveals an inner universe that needs a new compass whose

283
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:16.710
character needs to be reshaped, whose capacity is less than what it was intended for, so that he can

284
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:21.210
lead us to becoming the champion in this life, the way that he always designed, can we say amen to

285
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:30.830
that, You see it is important that jesus drives us to consider the questions that really matter in

286
00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:39.100
this life and that's why the story of Hannah and Samuel and a priest by the name of Eli are so

287
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:45.470
important because in first Samuel chapter three versus 1 to 10, we're not going to read it, we're

288
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:53.980
gonna rush ahead, is that in this story, Hannah couldn't have a child, she has Samuel, she gives

289
00:49:53.980 --> 00:50:03.520
Samuel to the service of God and now Eli is responsible for this child and making sure he learns and

290
00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:13.130
hears the voice of God. And what is powerful about this moment is that as Samuel finds himself in

291
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:24.550
this temple, he hears the voice of God for the very first time and he thinks it's the voice of Eli,

292
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:34.680
the priest. And so he goes to Eli and he says you called me and Eli says, go back to bed, I did not

293
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:42.690
call you. And Samuel goes back to bed and he hears God call him a second time and he goes back to

294
00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:49.410
Eli and said you called me. And what's happening in the story is that for the very first time we see

295
00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:55.390
Samuel hearing diverse, the voice of God and what we see is Eli who has forgotten it.

296
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.830
And Samuel is a child

297
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:12.880
and God is choosing him as his prodigy to now reshape what it looks like to be a servant of the Lord

298
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:19.330
and he's no longer going to use Eli, he's going to use Samuel and so he's introducing himself. But

299
00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:25.130
Samuel doesn't know this until finally, Eli says on the third time that Samuel comes to him and says

300
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:35.660
the next time that you hear your name called, say these words, your servant is listening and in that

301
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:44.260
moment when Samuel does that, he is not only introduced to God, but God begins to lead him on a

302
00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:53.010
journey of personal discovery and what the genius of Jesus is is that he reminds us to listen as a

303
00:51:53.010 --> 00:52:03.520
child, He wants us to see this story so we can understand the next one and in Matthew chapter 18 and

304
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:10.580
verses 1-3 in these verses, it says about the time the disciples came to Jesus and asked who is the

305
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:16.760
greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And so they all wanted to achieve something in this life, all of

306
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:23.640
his disciples and they would often argue about who would be the greatest among them in the kingdom

307
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:31.640
that Jesus was building. In fact at one time a mother even came and said, jesus, can both my sons

308
00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:39.150
sit on either side of you in the new kingdom that you are establishing and Jesus said to the woman,

309
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:46.370
you don't know what you're asking because Jesus already knew that he'd be hanging on a cross and

310
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:48.900
didn't want the same thing for her sons.

311
00:52:52.350 --> 00:53:01.160
And so when we think we have the answer of what success looks like, we sometimes need to understand

312
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:08.340
that God is already speaking to us about how he wants to redefine our understanding of that success

313
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:15.030
And in the story that we were in, in the verse that we were in. If we can go back to it in verse

314
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.710
three

315
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.290
he says, I tell you the truth that unless you turn from your sins and become like little Children,

316
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:32.850
you will never get into the kingdom of heaven. And so the genius of jesus is this, that instead of

317
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:39.450
us moving into adulthood, we are encouraged towards childhood.

318
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:53.420
Now all my life, I have been told to grow up. My wife still says that not all the time, but

319
00:53:53.420 --> 00:54:03.700
sometimes it comes out grow up. There is something about being challenged to leave childhood and

320
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:11.370
childhood things behind so that we can be adults and mature and move into adulthood and do adult e

321
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:19.100
things, right? But why would jesus then come to us and tell us that to enter into the Kingdom of

322
00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:29.070
Heaven to be a part of his kingdom? It wasn't by being an adult by being like a child and he brings

323
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:38.300
Children into his midst and he says I need you to become like this child. And the genius of jesus is

324
00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:46.570
this is that he knows that if we go back to childhood it will reawaken creativity and uniqueness

325
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:47.910
within each of us.

326
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:59.160
If we will go back to where Jesus is telling us to go back then we will understand this in a way

327
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:10.300
that Nicodemus couldn't. Nicodemus came to him and asked him, Jesus what must I do or be to be born

328
00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:15.830
again, what must I do or be to be part of the Kingdom of God? And you know what Jesus told him Jesus

329
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:23.600
told him you have to be born again and Nicodemus says, am I supposed to re enter my mother's womb,

330
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:31.830
we all know, this cannot be, this cannot be done once you're out, you can't go back in, we've moved

331
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:39.100
away from childhood to adulthood. How could I possibly do what it is that you are asking? But what

332
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:47.600
Jesus was telling him is that you experience the kingdom of God when you become a child again, it

333
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:58.850
said In numerous articles that when we're Children, we are all 95 divergent. And then by the time we

334
00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:09.460
get to the age of 12, just as we begin to enter into a form of adulthood That we become convergent

335
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:13.600
and only 5% of the population remains divergent

336
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:23.610
and what we now know and understand is that being a child and having childlike qualities is

337
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:34.750
important for genius. It is important for expression so that we can have a unique voice so we can do

338
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:42.380
the very things that we have might have decided that is no longer for us because we're a certain age

339
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:53.100
and stage in our adulthood. But the genius of jesus by telling us to become a child again is that

340
00:56:53.100 --> 00:57:00.160
he's telling us that we are to no longer be led by fear and shame, but be propelled instead by

341
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:10.070
openness, curiosity and discovery instead, because when you're a child, you have a big head, it's

342
00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:17.320
true and when you have a big head, your little body doesn't know how to support it and before you

343
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:23.320
can walk you crawl, but before you can even crawl, what you're doing is you're moving that gigantic

344
00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:31.830
head towards what you are curious about and you are curious about the things that you are open to

345
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:39.460
discovering and as you move your head you begin to then get to the point where you can then crawl to

346
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:49.070
the point where then you are so wobbly that when you walk you just mostly fall but it gets to the

347
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:56.760
point where even the fear or the pain cannot stop you from exploring

348
00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:05.860
and what God is saying is that if you will allow yourself to be a child again, if you will allow

349
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:15.840
this genius to be unlocked in you, then you can keep exploring without fear, without shame and know

350
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:26.080
that I have new things that I can still do in you and through you. And that is part of the genius of

351
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:36.690
jesus in the teaching that we are in, it is the genius of jesus that we are reminded, not not even

352
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:49.950
the fear or the pain of failure is enough and so we want to allow for the curiosity and for the

353
00:58:49.950 --> 00:59:00.200
wonder to grow within all of us. But jesus in his genius tells us that that's going to happen if we

354
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.670
are willing and ready to become like a child again,

355
00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:18.180
we cannot become a child, But we can become like one and have the curiosity and the wonder to keep

356
00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:26.660
exploring and keep experiencing the great things that God has in store for each of us and God will

357
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:34.320
help each of us unlock that genius. Amen. Can we play together?

358
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:44.130
And so Father, I want to thank you for each person that is here for those that are watching and for

359
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:53.340
how you have enabled each of us to to listen and to better understand what it is that you have

360
00:59:53.350 --> 01:00:03.390
spoken to us about becoming a child again, you showed us what it looked like to ask questions and to

361
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:13.360
be curious and to explore to discover and what it looks like to still be able to do that and the

362
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:22.030
spheres of influence that you have placed the sin that you still have great things in store for all

363
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:31.490
of us and more importantly you're gonna help us to make this world a better place because as we are

364
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:39.520
encouraged to become better than we make everything around us better too. So you help us to change

365
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:47.080
then we can bring that change into the world and that we are affecting every day And Lord I pray

366
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:54.610
that you would do that for each of us that you would bring about that change and and that

367
01:00:54.610 --> 01:01:02.130
transformation and we ask this now As we pray it in the name of the father and of the son and of the

368
01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:09.410
Holy Spirit one. God Amen. Amen. God bless you guys, thanks for listening, Thanks for that first

369
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:18.830
week that we have just I had an opportunity to do and and I look forward to the next four weeks

370
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:25.610

371
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:31.220
want to pick it up. It's called the Genius of jesus and it'll help you on your spiritual journey,

372
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.750
I'm sure of it. Well, thank you for being a part of this today. And I just wanted to share some um

373
01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:42.880
just some prayer things at the end of this gathering before we sing a song. Uh the first is that we

374
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:49.420
wanted to offer our heartfelt condolences to Isabel and the passing of your mom, we know there was

375
01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:57.240
such a, a difficult thing for you to go through. You missed so many weeks of being with us because

376
01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:05.070
you were with her and you saw her right to the end. You were a wonderful daughter, a beautiful

377
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:11.150
daughter to your mom. And and we just want to give you our condolences, Amen everyone. And that's

378
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:17.990
Isabel there with mike and and then we want to pray for carol lee who had to travel urgently to

379
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.490
South Africa because her mom passed away and so she's in South Africa right now and we want to just

380
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:33.790
pray that God be with her and with her family as they have already had the funeral yesterday believe

381
01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:40.520
and and that she would be able to rejoin her family and louise here. And uh so our condolences to

382
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:47.200
you louis and to your family and please pass on our prayers and condolences to carol lee as well.

383
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:57.140
And a few weeks back, I gave you guys some news on, on erIC and judy were both RCMP officers who

384
01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:02.720
have had the privilege of marrying and um, just being a part of their spiritual journey in life. And

385
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:10.950
uh, and in the last few years they moved to be in Ottawa and he was unfortunately in a tragic car

386
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:21.170
accident that revealed that he had a inoperable tumor in his brain. And so he passed out and crashed

387
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:28.290
his vehicle. And as a result of that accident, they found that he had this huge tumor which had gone

388
01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:35.310
undiagnosed and unnoticed by his doctors for quite some time. And so they're dealing with this. Um,

389
01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:42.290
on so many levels, the fact that he had been dealing with severe migraines for so long and that this

390
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:49.570
had never been caught. And then when it finally is they have to operate urgently and then when they

391
01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:55.660
operated, unfortunately, they also made some mistakes in that operation. So it's been a series of

392
01:03:55.670 --> 01:04:04.450
missteps and mishaps that he finds himself in in, in a lot of pain right now. His wife is beyond

393
01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:09.240
herself. We have two small kids eight and six years old. They're going through a lot and they've

394
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:16.540
asked us to pray for them as a church. And uh, he's going for a second operation. Uh, he went for a

395
01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:23.620
second operation yesterday and uh and the prognosis is not good what what everyone is telling him is

396
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:31.340
that it isn't good, but but we believe in a great God and we believe in the power of prayer. We

397
01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:36.850
believe in a jesus who still heels and we are going to pray right now for eric. Could you do that

398
01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:44.660
with me? I would ask that you would stand and and if you have faith, even uh as jesus said as small

399
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:55.100
as a mustard seed that you can join with us in praying that God would intervene and heal Eric.

400
01:04:55.110 --> 01:05:01.730
And so Lord we ask for your intervention in Eric's life. We thank you for what you've already done

401
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:08.040
in in saving him from the accident and helping him to discover what it is that was wrong with him

402
01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:14.590
all along. I pray God that you would give him the best medical care. But as a spiritual community of

403
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:22.210
faith, we want to surround this man and his family and ask for your healing in his life and we pray

404
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:29.010
this in jesus name. Amen, Amen. Thank you for praying with me. And uh and if you can remember to

405
01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:34.230
pray for ERic and I'll give you updates as they become available. Alright. And so we're ready to

406
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:40.600
sing this song and it's called miracle and we sang it at the very beginning and it's a song that I

407
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:47.290
know reminds us of the miracle that God can bring about in all of our lives. And so let's receive

408
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:57.870
this today and believe it for ourselves as we learn to be childlike again. So we can unlock our own

409
01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:05.100
genius in the way that God has always designed it to be. Amen. Let's do that. Let's sing together

410
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.440
on the open.

411
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:32.750
Just

412
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:40.170

413
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.830
