1
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.740
Yeah,

2
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.050
Mhm

3
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.180
mhm

4
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.660
On this Canada Day long weekend and we're privileged to be able to gather and to be able to

5
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.790
celebrate and to be able to welcome the presence of God not only into our lives but into the very

6
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.530
areas of our life that we didn't even know we needed God so desperately and sometimes it's like that

7
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:50.420
God just shows us and reveals something new to us that is completely unexpected when we gather in

8
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:58.770
spaces just like this in opportunities just like this, God has a way of finding us and reaching us

9
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.760
speaking to us and leading us to a profound place of transformation. And so I would invite you that

10
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:13.240
on this weekend and on this particular day today that you would be open to that and that you would

11
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.350
let God do something new in you as we would begin this gathering with some songs of worship. We're

12
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:27.080
going to also have an opportunity to continue with our series called Multiply and today we're going

13
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.900
to be looking at the story of the Lost Coin and there's something so profoundly beautiful about that

14
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:40.580
story and that parable. I know it's gonna speak to us in a new way today, there's some insights

15
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:48.100
there that I believe that God wants us to grasp about living a purposeful life. Now, something else

16
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.490
that is really important and that is that we are welcomed into the presence of God the way that we

17
00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:00.690
are because God knows exactly where he needs to lead us to experience change. Sometimes we don't

18
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.420
feel that when we gather in a church, sometimes we don't feel that when we gather with other

19
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:13.690
believers, we feel like there's something that is wrong with us and that keeps us away from God and

20
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:22.540
from other believers. But the thing about being on this journey is that God accepts us the way we

21
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:31.280
are and leads us to a place where we can experience all that he has for us. And so today just know

22
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.530
this. It's okay not to be okay that you already belong even before you believe. And so I would

23
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:43.960
invite you to stand and as you would do that, we would sing these songs together and I just want to

24
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:50.270
give you a warm welcome welcome to River's Edge. I'm Pastor Lorenzo. And this is the River's edge

25
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.750
worship team. Would you welcome them as we would sing together?

26
00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:03.220
And so father, we give this gathering to you on this weekend where we get to celebrate rest in jesus

27
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:21.550
name. Amen wait, if they are still at the mansion of his name, they'll say my God, it's still the

28
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.160
same.

29
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:37.790
The mighty sound of praise. They'll see my God is still the same. When did he break his promise?

30
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:48.620
When did his kind as they'll never has never will. My God is still the same. When did he use his

31
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:57.260
power. When did his mercy change? Never has never will. My God in the same.

32
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.590
My God to sing.

33
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.030
You prayed in desperation. If

34
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.760
they'll say my God, it's still the same.

35
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:32.610
If it's strong enough to keep hoping, it's chains. They'll say My God still the same.

36
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:42.710
Break is promised. When did it is kind of spare. Never have, Never will. My God.

37
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:57.790
When did he lose his power? When did mercy change? Never. Never. My God is still the same now. Once.

38
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:07.530
Did he ever stop moving? Now? Once has he ever let go? Not once. Did he ever stop proving God is in

39
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.460
control now? Did he ever stop moving?

40
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:25.170
Once has he ever stopped? God is in control. When did E brake is promised? When did it is kind of

41
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.580
failed. Never has never will. My God.

42
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:42.060
When he loses power. When there is less. You change. Never have, never will. My God is still the

43
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.500
same. What

44
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.580
now has he ever let go?

45
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.250
I've got is in control. One.

46
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.860
Never had. Never.

47
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:23.250
Right.

48
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:34.240
Let's take the time to worship and just tell God how we will worship his name. We love the Lord and

49
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.860
let us sing these words back to him. Hallelujah.

50
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:55.130
I count on one thing. The same guy that never fails will not fail me now. He won't fail me now in

51
00:12:55.130 --> 00:13:07.690
the waiting. The same guy is never late. He's working all things out. You're working all things out.

52
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:23.990
Yes, I will lift you high in the lowest valley. Yes, I will bless your name. Yes, I will sing for

53
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:31.650
joy when my heart is heavy on my days. Yes, I

54
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.240
will praise you.

55
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:55.650
Let's sing that again. I count on one thing. The same guy that never fans will not fail me now. He

56
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.470
won't fail me now.

57
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:10.650
The same guy who's never laid is working all things out. You're working all things out

58
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.490
valley that quick. Bless. You

59
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.460
will see for joy when my heart is heavy.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.360
Yes.

63
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.360
Nothing can stand again. I choose to pray.

64
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:20.130
Nothing can stand against. I choose to praise to glorify, glorify the name of all names. Nothing can

65
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.770
stand

66
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.050
to glorify glorify

67
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.960
thinking again.

68
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:37.260

Well

it was great, well welcome again. If I didn't get a chance to say hi earlier saying hi right now

108
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.160
we're glad that you're with us. Happy Canada Day, glad that you could be with us and uh I'm glad you

109
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.010
didn't have any plans today. Hey awesome. The best plans you could have had were to be here right

110
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:55.230
here at River's Edge. No one else is excited about me. Are you guys excited to be here? Yeah, it's

111
00:23:55.230 --> 00:24:02.690
all right. Hopefully you'll get more excited as the service goes on. But one of the things that we

112
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.610
wanted to share with you is that tonight as you know, Montreal is a great city to be in and it's

113
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:15.230
always an entertaining one. And and tonight there is a concert that's happening with Gira Gospel

114
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.860
Choir. They're going to be on the TD scene. We definitely want to encourage them and we know so many

115
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:29.190
of the people that are in this group and even our own Emily Larochelle is in it. So if you guys want

116
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:35.230
to go check that out tonight um it starts at 9:30 p.m. Some of you may have thought it's at seven or

117
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:42.990
7 30 it's at 9 30 I'm usually in bed by that time, but it's at 9:30 PM. Um and so have fun, this is

118
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:48.210
gonna be great, it's gonna be one of those things that you do want to go out and support and uh and

119
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:57.060
they just put on a tremendous tremendous show that really highlights of course gospel music um jesus

120
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:02.270
and the power of his presence and so I wanna encourage you guys to be there. Well we also have four

121
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.080
ways that you can give the right here on the screen. Each one of those is a great way for you to

122
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:13.670
make a contribution if you can and you're welcome to um know that this is a place that is that

123
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.560
is funded through your generosity and we're able to keep our doors open and do the things that we do

124
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.910
every week and throughout the week because of that generosity. So thank you, stick around after the

125
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:29.060
gathering for the after party. We love to hang out afterwards. We've got a great cafe, we've got

126
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:35.040
some sweets and treats. We've got great coffee and other beverages that you guys can partake in but

127
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.460
it's more about the community hanging out, getting to know someone and this place can sometimes feel

128
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:47.220
big but it can also feel incredibly small when you don't know anyone and you feel like you're kind

129
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:53.920
of being walked by people that are just as shy as you. So if someone doesn't make that first step

130
00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:01.320
and just say hi and give your name and and just start a conversation. Well this place is not gonna

131
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.760
feel like community, it's not gonna feel like family, it's not gonna feel like a place that you want

132
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:12.730
to come to every single week um and be a part of and so I would just ask you to um just make that

133
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:19.140
extra step and and just say hi to someone that you don't know today. We want to dismiss the kids. We

134
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:25.090
have a great program right there in our daycare, which is throughout the week, monday to friday.

135
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.230
It's our day care, but on Sundays we get to use it for our kids program. So if there's any kids here,

136
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.520
you don't have to be here. There's something way more fun for you over there. Believe me, you don't

137
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.400
want to listen to me. You want to be with the other kids, hearing a lesson and watching videos and

138
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:45.840
doing crafts and having fun. And so I know it's maybe your first time. Maybe a little shy, but don't

139
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.140
worry about it. You can always come back if you don't like it. Okay, so go check that out today.

140
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:58.470
That's the kids program that's happening right now. Good. Alright, so we're gonna jump right into

141
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:03.900
the message which today is called the purposeful life. And we're in this series called Multiply. Its

142
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.270
watch this quick video and then we'll continue.

143
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.590
That video was really quick.

144
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:34.070
All right, So, so you can get the rest of this day in. We're gonna jump right into the scriptures.

145
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:39.140
And it's a beautiful passage. It's one of the parables of something that gets lost that Jesus

146
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:45.740
teaches on and we don't often look at this as something that refers to multiplication, but I believe

147
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:52.340
that God is going to speak to us exactly about that. And here it is in Luke 15 and then in Verse

148
00:27:52.350 --> 00:28:01.150
eight. Now it says suppose a woman has 10 silver coins and then she loses one, won't she light a

149
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:10.720
lamp, sweep the entire house, and then search carefully until she finds it. And when she finds it,

150
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:20.260
she will call in her friends and neighbors and say rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.

151
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:31.330
And in the same way there is joy in the presence of God's angels, even when one sinner repents. Now,

152
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:39.410
one of the things about this passage is that jesus is telling a sequence of stories Of things that

153
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:48.520
get lost in the first story in Luke chapter 15, he talks about a sheep that wanders off, loses this

154
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:58.730
way and the shepherd goes after it in this story. It is about carelessness, something that is so

155
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:08.650
precious even to the possessor of it gets lost. And it isn't because she didn't care. And it isn't

156
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:18.190
because she wanted it to get lost. But it did. And sometimes that happens with us in the areas of

157
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:29.690
our life that we can sometimes take or attention off of. The story is about something that has great

158
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:39.820
value. But somehow some of it Is lost. And in this case it's one lost coin. And the story that we're

159
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:49.580
looking at, it's a woman who at this time is doing what anyone would do, which is she's going to do

160
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:56.780
everything in her power to recover it because it is precious. It has value not just sentimental

161
00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:04.100
value, but it has a monetary value as well. There's something about shipwrecks that has always

162
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:13.850
fascinated me. I love watching documentaries. I love watching treasure get recovered. I've always

163
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:20.790
had a dream that I would one day own my own metal detector. Anybody else? I don't know what it is.

164
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:27.370
But I've always seen that crazy guy on the beach with the metal detector and I thought one day

165
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:34.310
that's gonna be me. I feel like there's purpose in that for me somehow. There's something about

166
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.700
uncovering, discovering and maybe finding something valuable that just intrigues me. Well, I was

167
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:47.240
just reading on shipwrecks and I look up shipwrecks often. It's one of the things that I love to do

168
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:54.470
because there are so many over the centuries that have been lost at sea and today's technology with

169
00:30:54.470 --> 00:31:03.270
its submersibles and how they are like self automated, where they can just be brought down to

170
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:09.840
incredible depths with incredible clarity. I mean, you're looking at images that are taken by a

171
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:19.600
Submersible um that was able to go to a depth of 900 m. That's how clear the images now. And so they

172
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:26.560
know even before they invest any kind of money in terms of trying to recover something that they can,

173
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:34.040
they can do anything in terms of shining a light on that no matter what the depth is and then

174
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:42.130
recovering that treasure. Now, the first image that you're seeing here is of a ship and the ship is

175
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:54.090
called the San José galleon. And it's a ship that sailed from Spain and this is the holy grail of

176
00:31:54.090 --> 00:32:03.200
shipwrecks. People have been looking for this for a very, very long time. And it was first found off

177
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.410
of Columbia's coast in 2015. But when a treasure like this is found, then there tends to be disputes

178
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:18.760
between countries. So Spain wanted it because it's saying there's Colombia says it's off of our

179
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:28.640
shore's it's ours and Bolivia and even peru because their treasures were on the ship. And so

180
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:36.790
everyone had a historical record and a tie to what this shipwreck had to offer. And at one point,

181
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:47.760
Columbia was a colony of Spain. And so as a result uh Spain wanted to have this treasure for the

182
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.590
realm. But the Colombian government Has now made an announcement just in the last few days that they

183
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:59.560
are not going to give the treasure back, fact they're not even gonna sell it, they're going to

184
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:08.770
create a museum and keep this treasure. Now imagine that the value of this treasure is $17 billion.

185
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:16.790
That's that's And now the people who bring it up have to like really document it all the way through

186
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:23.470
to make sure that nothing is taken. And so there's gonna be a lot of eyes on this treasure to make

187
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:30.270
sure that nothing is taken. That isn't supposed to. Now, the thing about this treasure in particular

188
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:38.960
is that they found one ship. But in the search for this one ship, guess what? They found two others.

189
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:47.420
And so it seems like in looking for one they found more than that in hopes that there would be some

190
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:58.590
treasure they discovered that there is so much more that they could have even imagined. And so this

191
00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:07.760
particular ship is a representation of sometimes how our lives are like now you may not look at

192
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.900
yourself and think of yourself as a shipwreck. Yeah,

193
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.670
but I'm going to say that I am a shipwreck.

194
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:31.970
And I'm going to say that I went to a very deep and dark place away from my purpose

195
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:41.560
and away from the light that was supposed to guide me to shore.

196
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:51.170
And and God stopped at absolutely nothing in making sure that I would once again be found.

197
00:34:54.340 --> 00:35:00.040
And I want you to imagine that no matter where you've been in your life, no matter what you've gone

198
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:10.860
through that God has a powerful and specific purpose for you. That you are of infinite value and

199
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:20.220
wealth. And here's the thing. It is beyond even your comprehension. Now that treasure interestingly

200
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.170
enough gained value

201
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.050
after it was lost.

202
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:36.220
And sometimes when we lose something or we lose ourselves or we lose sight of who we are or we lose

203
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.170
sight of our purpose, we may think that we have lost value.

204
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:49.450
But what God is revealing, what he's showing us, what he's demonstrating is that because that is

205
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:59.650
never the case with us. So it isn't the case with this sunken treasure now that it's been found and

206
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:08.160
it's brought to the surface. This treasure has more value than ever before. Can we say amen to that

207
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:16.970
more value. And so your life is just like that. Now, the first thing I want to talk to you about in

208
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:24.140
the story that we're in and it is an important one. We're going to move past this illustration and

209
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:31.570
and I want you to think of what it means for us today to put ourselves in the position that this

210
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:43.510
woman is in. Because the image of the lost coin is this, it's lost jewelry. It's a piece of the

211
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:49.550
jewelry that's been lost. And this is what they did is that they would wear this even as a headdress

212
00:36:50.330 --> 00:37:01.970
and all the coins of what was in essence her dowry was worn as part of her attire and this would be

213
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:08.940
taken out in special occasions and whatnot. And if ever it was needed then one of the coins could

214
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:17.180
always be sold uh and and then it could then fund their life and their lifestyle and and what they

215
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.740
would need it for even in terms of being able to purchase something or get into business or

216
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:30.500
sometimes even just simply to survive. And so it was very important. Now we don't know if this woman

217
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:36.960
was was married already or if she was still single, but in the context of the story, it doesn't

218
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:46.540
really matter what matters is that this is what she wore and this is what she had lost a precious

219
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:55.140
coin. Now the thing about a coin is that it always has an image on it and when a coin has an image

220
00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:04.400
on it, it always reflects a sense of governorship or authority on that coin. And I don't know if you

221
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:11.570
see this and if you understand this or not, but in the story, jesus is saying, the image that is on

222
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:19.910
every one of those coins is the image that is on this life and the image that is on this life is the

223
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:28.480
heavenly father's image and that when this coin is lost, this woman will do everything she can to

224
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:36.950
recover it because in essence what she's trying to recover is her lost image. There's something

225
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:44.090
about imagery and mythology and there's something about understanding how those two things can

226
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:52.330
sometimes play together and sometimes be at odds with one another. And sometimes we don't understand

227
00:38:52.330 --> 00:39:00.160
our origins, we don't understand how those origins reveal a purpose. And I've often heard people say

228
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:07.320
I don't know what my purpose is and they kind of go through life and they feel that their life is

229
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:15.640
just not meaningful because it doesn't seem like they are making a real change or a real difference.

230
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:24.520
Every day they wake up and sacrifice their time and their talents and their treasure to try to make

231
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:33.600
a life out of the time that they've been given here on earth. And sometimes it can feel like we're

232
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:40.100
like that sheep that wanders off in search of something better when it should have stayed where it

233
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:48.070
was or the coin that was part of a collection but makes a break for it and tries to go out on its

234
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:57.350
own or a ship that is filled and loaded with goods of infinite value. But on the way on the journey

235
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:06.250
something happens. And in the story of the San galleon, the San José galleon ship that was actually

236
00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:14.950
shot by and with the cannon fire from the brits and it was sunk and sometimes someone can come into

237
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:20.640
your life and take a shot at you. Someone can come and take you down and something can happen

238
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:29.740
tragically to interfere with your journey and in the process of of of of just like going somewhere,

239
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:38.920
you never get there and you end up sinking where you are because you were just under attack. And I

240
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:46.180
hear people sometimes use terminology like I really believe that that satan is after me or there's

241
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.800
demonic powers and forces against me. It seems that whenever I try to make something of myself or

242
00:40:52.800 --> 00:41:00.130
advance in my life that something happens to to destroy that and to destroy me and instead of being

243
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:07.670
where I imagined I would be my life, what it's supposed to be. I'm here instead the bottom of this

244
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:16.730
ocean loaded with treasure, but now never to be recovered. We sometimes imagine that something that

245
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:21.330
is so precious, something that is a piece of the feeling

246
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:36.420
and the purpose of what we we're supposed to be in half is gone and this woman, she does something,

247
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:42.140
she just starts to look for it. Have you ever looked for something that's been lost?

248
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:50.320
I was doing some landscaping the last couple of days in my house and I lost a hedge clipper. It's

249
00:41:50.320 --> 00:42:00.010
been driving me crazy. I have looked absolutely everywhere. I can't find it now. Probably I loaned

250
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:08.800
it to someone and I can't remember who and that's probably what happened, but I don't even know who

251
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:15.550
to reach out to. It's like it's gone. So after searching for it for several days leading up to the

252
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:21.100
day that I knew I was gonna do this work. I just on the second day, I'm like, I need this. I got to

253
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:29.130
get it and my wife's like, no, find another way. I'm like, no, I can't find another way. I mean I

254
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:36.560
could but it's gonna be like with scissors, I'm not gonna be like out there for hours cutting it. I

255
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.940
don't even have like a good clippers or anything. It's just like I have a small hand scissors for

256
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:49.610
gardening. I go, it's not gonna work. I need the hedge and I swear before the Lord as my savior, I

257
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:57.760
did not do this because I wanted to add a new tool to my collection. I it says this is not what

258
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:05.030
happened at all, but when you lose something and you can't find it and you really need it and you're

259
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.880
desperate to have it in the moment that you need it. That's when you really start to look for it.

260
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:16.860
Does that make sense? And I believe that this woman had lost this some time ago, but when she went

261
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:22.580
to get it because she needed it, she realized that something was missing. Now, I don't know how you

262
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:31.850
are, but we don't always notice what's missing in us until we get to that moment. And when we get to

263
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:39.870
that moment, then we realize it's no longer there. The scriptures tell us that it fell off somehow

264
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:48.890
it got lost. And she makes a decision to obviously light a lamp and that tells you that where she is

265
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:55.610
is obviously dark and she needs more light and when you need to see what's missing, you're not gonna

266
00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.580
be able to do this on your own. And and that's where God comes in, because the first thing he wants

267
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:11.400
to do is he wants to shine more light so that you can find that which is lost and when we're lost,

268
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.970
One of the things we do is that we stay in the dark when we're lost, we stay away from the light

269
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:26.130
when we're lost. We stay away from the one who is the light. And we imagine that just because we

270
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:32.460
know that it's missing and just because we know that it's lost. And just because we have found

271
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:40.190
things before that have been lost, that we would find this too. But what the story reminds us is

272
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:46.440
that some things can never be found, they can never be recovered. They could never be seen again

273
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:51.110
unless we go to a more powerful light.

274
00:44:54.190 --> 00:45:00.220
I want you to imagine what it looks like for you in this moment and season in your life

275
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:10.340
to finally see clearly because of the light that is God that is shining brightly in your life. And

276
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:17.060
then I want you to imagine how if there isn't enough light in your life right now that God is able

277
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:24.610
to give you more light so that you can finally see things with greater clarity? You know when the

278
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:31.180
light goes on, It does a couple of things? It doesn't just illuminate the space. It illuminates your

279
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:38.400
life. It gives you hope like never before you feel like now you have a chance. You feel like now

280
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:45.630
what was in darkness no longer is now you can see every part of the room that which is lost can now

281
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:51.710
be found because you've got enough light to finally see it. You see God doesn't just come in to

282
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:57.680
shine a light to show you where your shipwreck to show you where you're lost. To show you what is

283
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:04.210
lost. To show you what's broken and how you're broken. He shines the light to give you hope.

284
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:13.430
He shines the light so that you can move from a place where things are lost to a place where they

285
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.100
can finally be found.

286
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:29.280
I have experienced setbacks in my searches to recover that which is lost. And I believe this woman

287
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:37.770
experienced her own like she was going through things that didn't necessarily add up to what we

288
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:45.630
thought would happen in the story. I don't know. But sometimes someone comes along and with just a

289
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.300
thoughtless comment.

290
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:59.600
It can just make us feel lost all over again. A comment can get us so down and so discouraged that

291
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:10.130
we can sometimes just give up and walk away. We can stop fighting, stop searching, stop looking. And

292
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:15.820
we do that in relationships all the time. We do that with people. But I want to just turn it more to

293
00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:22.870
the attention of Are you doing this with yourself? You see there's something beautiful about this

294
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:30.490
story because it isn't just about searching for a lost coin. The story is searching for one's soul,

295
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:39.600
jesus tells the story because he wants us to understand that we are all searching for one soul. The

296
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:49.370
larger meaning of that which is lost is seen and understood in this coin. And so we need to

297
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:57.650
understand that what God has in store for us needs to be understood in light of this. So, are we

298
00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:07.990
searching for a coin or in the story? Are we searching for one's soul and the value of the item is

299
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:16.710
not What is the most important thing in the story obviously, But it's the fact that your soul is the

300
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:24.980
jewel that God himself is searching for and and this this woman is doing everything in our power to

301
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:34.780
find it again, searching and looking for doing everything possible because it is a prized objective.

302
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:43.400
But what about how we can devote too much of our attention to practical concerns and neglect the

303
00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:52.750
deeper regions of the inner life that we allow to turn to a wasteland when this coin is lost, it's

304
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:59.540
lost in the dust. And I want you to imagine that when God formed us, he formed us from the dust of

305
00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:07.520
the earth and then he breathed life into us. The story that we're looking at is a coin that gets

306
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:17.460
lost. It gets lost in the dust and and nothing can grow in such neglected soil. So what God does is

307
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:25.560
that he has to breathe life into it. Now, if you don't breathe life back into yourself or let God

308
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:32.540
breathe life back into yourself, then that which is lost, that which is just dust, that which is

309
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:42.620
just in the ground in infertile soil where it cannot grow into what it was meant to be. If you

310
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:51.780
don't allow for God to breathe life back into you, then you can never recover that which was lost.

311
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:59.290
God wants you to experience multiplication in your life, but he wants you to understand that that

312
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:07.910
begins with him breathing new life into you, recovering you, forming you, shaping you breathing into

313
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:16.670
you and he wants us to understand how important this is in the story. You're going to read these

314
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:26.880
keywords like worth and value and face and and lost and found and and the symbolism in each of these

315
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:35.080
and other key words. They open up the wisdom of this ancient tale because the soul does not live on

316
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:43.910
the surface, but it is in the hidden recesses of our heart and it is in the hidden recesses of

317
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:52.280
everyday moments, just like this one and it is there that we can easily out of carelessness, lose

318
00:50:52.280 --> 00:51:03.400
our identity, lose our image, lose our face, lose our purpose. But first we have to understand that

319
00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:11.870
God says, there are steps that you can do to regain your soul. The first thing he says is that we

320
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:24.450
see that this woman turns on the light and then she begins to sweep. Now there are images like this

321
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:31.630
one that kind of give us an idea of what this looks like, the kind of household it would have been

322
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:39.360
and the kind of sweeping she would have done and the way she would have went about trying to recover

323
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:49.190
the coin that was lost. And this image may mean that we would have to develop our purpose in the

324
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:57.290
clarity of God's light and his lamp. And the bible tells us that his word is like that lamp, it is a

325
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:04.010
light that he puts in the room is a light that he puts at our feet and it gives us just enough light

326
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:13.440
to be able to see what we need to see. Now. I want to see as far as I can possibly see now when I go

327
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:21.760
camping, which is once every decade. I I did it during the pandemic with my brother, my son and my

328
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:30.530
cousin. We went out to this really far away place with just you know, just nothing with nothing

329
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:40.160
basically. And and it was like a little large and it was fun. It wasn't, it was horrible and my and

330
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.480
my son said he would never go back again ever again in his life. He said, this is after I bought him

331
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:51.500
galoshes and I bought him a whole bunch of gear and the fish, new fishing anyways. The point is a

332
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:59.380
lot of money was spent uh for not a lot of fun. But we we we went anyways and and one of the things

333
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:05.250
that I knew I needed was a good flashlight, you know? And so I went to get this flashlight and I

334
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:10.430
know that there are flashlights that you know, you could have and they can shine a bit of light. But

335
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:18.190
I want I want the flashlight that shines across the lake, that's the one if I'm gonna get something,

336
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:24.150
I'm gonna try to get the best thing that I can get. So it lasts forever even if I never use it again,

337
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:31.140
I want it to last because I figure I'll someone will borrow it

338
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.820
and I'll never get it back and it'll bless someone. Just like my hedge clipper. I'm sorry, I can't

339
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:48.820
let it go. And so and so we're gonna do careful searching with this light. I want you to imagine

340
00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:57.590
that that God is such a powerful light that he doesn't just give you light for the moment, but he

341
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.970
can at least point you in the direction that you need to go.

342
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:08.570
And and I think that sometimes we lose sight of that. You know, sometimes I just need someone to

343
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:14.810
point me in the right direction. Does that make sense? Like you don't need to give me everything.

344
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.870
You don't need to tell me everything? You need to explain everything. You don't even need to figure

345
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:27.770
it all out and then try to get me to really understand it and apply it to. Sometimes all I need is

346
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:34.490
someone to just point me in the right direction and God's life does something beautiful. It it

347
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:41.250
doesn't just light up the area, but it lights up the direction in which you're supposed to go in and

348
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:52.760
there's something that happens in the process of sweeping, sweeping away dust? Dusty ideas,

349
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.760
dusty attitudes,

350
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.260
dusty understandings,

351
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:15.980
dusty spirituality, dusty faith,

352
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:24.860
a dusty way of seeing and understanding the world that we live in

353
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:36.660
and seeing that what God wants us to do is that in the moment, in which he lights the room and

354
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:44.470
provides hope and direction. He now says, it is time for you to sweep.

355
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:57.050
Nothing that is lost can be found unless the action on our part of sweeping takes place. You want to

356
00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:04.390
see multiplication in your life, then what is God asking you to sweep? You want to find what is lost.

357
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:11.010
You are not gonna find it unless you start to clean up the areas of your mind and your heart and the

358
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:18.810
areas of your soul that you have forgotten about that need attention right now. And so God is saying,

359
00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:26.520
would you begin to do that work now? What happens when she does the sweeping after the action of

360
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:35.340
sweeping? We know that she actually finds the coin. And so God is saying I will be the light. But

361
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.460
you gotta sweep

362
00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:45.610
sometimes I want God to be the light and the sweeper anybody else. I just want him to do it all.

363
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:56.270
Come on like I am lazy on on the best of days like I know that there's spiritually like the least I

364
00:56:56.270 --> 00:57:06.150
can do and and still see blessing in my life. I'm all over that and we are so used to that because

365
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:14.220
God is so gracious. He's so merciful and compassionate and loving that even when we don't do much,

366
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:21.450
we experience multiplication because he wants us to be blessed. He wants us to live out our purpose

367
00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:30.890
of multiplication. But he imagine if we got up off the ground off of the dust and began to sweep the

368
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:39.010
dust away the coins that we would find the treasure that would be recovered. The change that would

369
00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:48.050
occur. The soul that would be found to be able to live out our purpose. Like never before this woman

370
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:55.740
begins to celebrate because that which is lost is found. And God is saying I need you to get this.

371
00:57:55.750 --> 00:58:05.160
Every single one of you has lost something. I think sometimes I'm not even aware that I have until I

372
00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:17.300
went to look for it until I needed it. And then I realized that what I needed was nowhere to be

373
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:24.360
found. And that's what happened with this woman. You don't realize you've lost it until it's too

374
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:31.420
late. And that's when you've got to take the step. Lord, I'm gonna come into your light. Lord, I'm

375
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:37.780
gonna do the sweeping that you're asking me to do. I'm gonna look everywhere and I'm going to

376
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:44.010
recover that which is lost. And God is saying, if you do this, here's what I promise you, you will

377
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:50.090
find it again. Can you say amen to that? Hey, you know what these stories are about? It's not about

378
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:57.510
what gets lost, but it's how that which is lost gets found. God is trying to tell you that that

379
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:04.510
which is lost can be found again. And then what the woman does is that she brings everybody together

380
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:11.420
for a celebration. She's not gonna celebrate this on her own. She could have just kept it to herself.

381
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:18.470
But she goes into the story of how she had lost it in the first place. How she herself felt lost,

382
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:25.970
how she didn't know what she would do because this was so important. I know that many of us right

383
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:33.250
now are feeling lost. We're feeling like if God doesn't show me the way I am not gonna live a

384
00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:40.590
purposeful life, I'm not going to live a life of multiplication. I'm not going to experience the joy

385
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:45.240
of seeing that which is lost found. I'm not gonna be able to celebrate this with my friends and

386
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:52.530
family, but what God is showing all of us is that we cannot think this way. We cannot believe this.

387
00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:58.710
Not even for a moment. I don't know what God wants to recover in your life. I just know this. There

388
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:05.190
is always something to recover. And whether we realize this or not, whether we're the sheep that

389
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:11.850
wanders or we are the coin that is lost out of carelessness, something always gets lost. But these

390
01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:17.780
stories, what they remind us in the principles of multiplication and that is that that which is lost

391
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.830
can always be found.

392
01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:24.820
And so, you know what it is that you want to recover.

393
01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:33.190
But then what happens when you open up yourself to God and ask him to show you what's been lost and

394
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:40.520
needs to be recovered, it might be a different image. It may not be the same story.

395
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:50.730
Sometimes I have pursued something that was lost. And let let me be clear on this. It's not always

396
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:55.700
the case. But there have been moments in my life where God has shown me that is something Lorenzo

397
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.200
that should stay lost. You don't need that.

398
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:05.640
That is something that I made sure in a way that you would lose it

399
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:09.330
because that was gonna be your shipwreck.

400
01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:17.890
So when you're in the light, God shows you the things that you should go after. The things that you

401
01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:27.790
would want to recover. the things that are lost that should be found. Not everything should be. And

402
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:34.600
that's why it's important to not just trust your mind and your heart to not just believe in your

403
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.600
emotions, but to open yourself up to the light and to the guidance that it can provide, so that it can

404
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:52.310
show you what it is that you should go after, what you shouldn't stop looking for. What you should

405
01:01:52.310 --> 01:02:02.220
trust and believe God with all of your heart that that which is lost can be found again. Amen. God

406
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:11.590
bless you guys. Thank you so much. Can we just pray together and ask that God would just be that

407
01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:17.410
light in our lives and in our hearts right now that he would show us what it is that we would need

408
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:25.060
to know what we would need to see. But we would need to understand. And so Father, as we turn our

409
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:33.340
attention to you and as we ask that you would shine your light ever so brightly on our lives that

410
01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:40.360
you would remind us once again of what it looks like to live a purposeful life. We may have lost

411
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:49.200
something out of carelessness and we may have lost something that was of great value. But Lord, you

412
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.810
are able to shine that light and give us

413
01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:08.200
the determination and the passion to begin to sweep the room so that it can be found again. Lord you

414
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:18.030
are with us. In that search, you will show us what it is that we need to do. You will reveal the

415
01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:28.530
areas of our life that need to be cleaned so that that which is lost can once again be found. It's

416
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:37.380
the Lord. In this moment we understand that you are a God who loves to rescue to recover and to

417
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:44.110
restore. And as we come before you, we ask that you would do that in all of our lives. That you

418
01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:52.960
would help us to experience a blessing that only you can bring. Lord. We are grateful for all that

419
01:03:52.960 --> 01:04:03.490
you have done so far for each of us. But we also recognize that there is more that can be done and

420
01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:05.500
more that can be experienced.

421
01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:18.310
I pray that we would not be complacent but rather that we would be mindful and purposeful of all

422
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:28.530
that you have in store for us. And so Lord, because we have all lost something. I pray that in this

423
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:37.440
moment you would make it clear to us, each one of us. If this is something that we are to come

424
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:48.790
before you and diligently seek until it is found. I pray that you give us that clarity right now and

425
01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:59.050
that you would give us the blessing of recovering it and then celebrating that which was lost has

426
01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:06.890
been found. And we pray this in jesus name. Amen Amen. Thanks guys! Thank you so much. So glad that

427
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:14.800
you are here today and we're gonna sing one more song before we have our after party. So please

428
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:21.580
stick around. I haven't met you yet. Um I'm gonna be staying there so I want you to come to me if

429
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:26.010
that's possible. Okay? And if I'm talking to someone, don't worry, just interrupt because sometimes

430
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:31.910
those conversations can go longer just because there's no one else coming. Does that make sense?

431
01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.060
There's no one else coming to me saying hi. So, but I do want to meet you. I want, I want to say hi,

432
01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:43.310
I want to, I want you to get to know me as well. And so this is really about finding connection and

433
01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:48.440
community here. So God bless you guys, let's sing this song one more time. Would you stand you guys

434
01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:56.110
all good? You're good to stand. Yeah. Who's tired? Who feels tired? Be honest. Do you feel

435
01:05:56.110 --> 01:06:02.440
tired? Put up your hand. Do you really feel tired? Some of you feel tired? Okay. I came in exhausted.

436
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:09.020
I'm gonna be honest. I came in like literally exhausted. I was stupid enough to take a nap

437
01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:14.920
yesterday afternoon. It totally ruined me. Did that ever happen to anybody? You take a nap and it

438
01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:20.860
just ruins you. I went to bed at one o'clock in the morning just because I couldn't fall back asleep.

439
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:26.680
So sometimes when you get like a holiday or a day off or something like that, you end up taking

440
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:35.000
advantage of the fact that you get to rest. What a mistake sometimes. I feel more tired today. Oh

441
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:41.890
man, I'm sorry. I'd like to tell stories and share about my stupidities. Um Hopefully we can all

442
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:47.800
learn and grow from them. Uh Can we ready to sing this song? Yeah let's do it. Okay let's welcome

443
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.410
the team. Let's sing this song and I'll see you guys in a few moments. Yeah

444
01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:13.130
just wait if they're still at the mention of his name they'll say my God it's still the same as

445
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:26.410
if they still fall at the mighty sound of praise. They'll say my God is still the same. When did he

446
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:37.900
break his promise? When did his kind as family? Never never will. My God is still the same. When did

447
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:47.760
he loses power? When did it change? Never have never will. My God still the same.

448
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.050
My God.

449
01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.600

450
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:05.260

451
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:09.540

452
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:21.400

453
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:26.580
promise.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:41.140
Never have never will feel the same when power change.

456
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:58.190

01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:10.990
God is in control with

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:22.690
Never will. My God is still the same when
