00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:06.890
worship team that are already here.

10
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:19.799
Our first song we're gonna sing this morning is called our God And this song just reminds us of how

11
00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:29.500
God is greater. he's stronger. And I wanna share a verse from Psalm 1 45 verse three, God is

12
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:38.229
magnificent. He can never be praised enough. There are no boundaries to his greatness. Generation

13
00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:47.130
after generation stands in awe of your work. Each one tells stories of your mighty acts and that's

14
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.460
what we're doing here today. So let's join all together and sing this beautiful song

15
00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:15.349
to.

16
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.849
This

17
00:10:30.289 --> 00:10:30.780
cards.

18
00:11:13.099 --> 00:11:13.229
is

19
00:13:54.530 --> 00:14:00.460
as we've done it before. Um But I wanted to share with you the intention that the songwriters had in

20
00:14:00.469 --> 00:14:07.890
writing this song belief for it. Um They wanted to remind us to have hope and to believe that God is

21
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:15.419
able to do immeasurably more than all we can ask or imagine according to his power that is at work

22
00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:21.489
is in us. So now that you're all warmed up, let's sing this song together.

23
00:14:43.929 --> 00:14:44.080
and

24
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:49.599
they say this check,

25
00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:55.750
they don't know you.

26
00:15:07.869 --> 00:15:08.190
Very.

27
00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:19.429
Yeah.

28
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:30.799
No.

29
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:21.830
Believe me,

30
00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:32.280
Yeah.

31
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.680
So this song is about believing, about having faith, and I, so I wanna share with you someone who

32
00:18:56.689 --> 00:19:03.079
had great faith in the Bible. And you all know the story, it's a story about the Centurion and Roman

33
00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:11.430
captain whose servant was paralyzed and was suffering. and how he had faith that Jesus had authority

34
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:21.260
to heal his servant without even going anywhere near his servant, and he his faith was so big that

35
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:28.849
it says in the Bible that amazed Jesus guys if you ever amaze Jesus put that like in your headline

36
00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:37.489
of your CV or your Lincoln Bio. Like first thing I amazed Jesus right? But, you know, Jesus was

37
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:46.510
amazed like, whoa, you know, And so in Matthew 8 13, because of his faith, it says, then Jesus said

38
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:55.910
to the centurion go let it be done just as you believed it would. And a servant was healed at that

39
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:04.699
moment. you know, we want to invite you to sing this next part of the song. They're simple words,

40
00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:16.489
but they're so powerful. It goes. You said, I believe you said it is done. And I just want you, we

41
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:23.479
just want you to, you know, just lift up your voices. If you can stand, stand for this part, it's so

42
00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:31.219
powerful. We want you to sing this over your life over your past, over your relationships, over your

43
00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:37.959
health, over anything that you've been praying for a breakthrough for God. You said this over my

44
00:20:37.969 --> 00:20:45.560
life, I believe you said this and it is done. Declare this now

45
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.380

46
00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:08.719

67
00:30:39.849 --> 00:30:48.219
Good morning everyone. Yeah. Good. Well, Simone some clapping, some timid clapping with the daylight

68
00:30:48.229 --> 00:30:55.819
saving time. It's always a little more difficult to wake up in the morning. We had some difficulty

69
00:30:55.829 --> 00:31:04.140
to wake up this morning. Yeah, only a few of us. So only 30% of us. So not the majority. so uh for

70
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:12.800
the other, give us our trick. But uh seriously this morning. Um So it's the next in our series with

71
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:20.589
living with the end in mind. And it's really a privilege for me to be with you. Um For those of you

72
00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:25.180
who aren't aware, I was there also last week, Lorenzo is on vacation with his family. He will be

73
00:31:25.189 --> 00:31:33.290
back next week. I'm really glad, uh that he will be back. Uh Really, really, really glad Red Carpet

74
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:40.280
for Lorenzo and his family. Uh But uh so super privileged to be with you. But I've listened to, I've

75
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:47.010
listened myself last week and I wanted to give you a big round of applause for yourself. Your

76
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.880
attention, your dedication for that gathering because it was really tough, too hard. So clap

77
00:31:51.890 --> 00:32:00.339
applause yourself and I applause yourself as well. OK. You did an amazing job, guys. Um The only one

78
00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:06.949
that was sleeping is um that person right here. So we have a picture uh of the person that was

79
00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:13.869
sleeping. Yeah, it was a dog. So, yeah, and it's uh our dear uh Yolanda, our director of Finance and

80
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:19.189
Administration that sent me that picture. And she said to me, Joan, it was really good. Only the dog

81
00:32:19.199 --> 00:32:25.420
was sleeping. So what an encouragement for me. So I'll try to wake the dog this morning. So that's

82
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:33.229
my, my objective. So, so in that series, what we've tried to, to achieve really briefly for those

83
00:32:33.239 --> 00:32:41.369
who weren't with us last week. Uh It's uh I think the idea of our end in mind and I started that

84
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:48.760
series with a psychiatrist uh Elizabeth Kubler Ross, uh who studied uh with people that were about

85
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:56.015
to die and she Made some interviews with these, with these people. Uh many, many interviews uh to do

86
00:32:56.025 --> 00:33:02.494
uh his thesis and all our research and what she found is that mostly people at the end of their days

87
00:33:02.505 --> 00:33:09.239
uh are thinking about two things, first, a right relationship with God and second, a right

88
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:15.270
relationship with their loved one. And last week, we touched briefly about the right relationship

89
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.280
with God. And this week we will cover a right relationship with dear ones, but we'll open that a

90
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:31.770
little bit more uh wider to uh the others. So God first and others person. So what a good way to

91
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:38.219
talk about a relationship with people than to take an example in family relationship. You know,

92
00:33:38.229 --> 00:33:46.050
that's a fertile soil for relationship example. And I'll give you an example. So for those of you

93
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:53.089
who aren't aware, so I asked the, the permission to my sisters to be able to Uh have that story uh

94
00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:58.729
open in the white like I will do today. But uh for confidentiality purposes, I will name my sister

95
00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:07.449
by number. So to avoid any uh relatedness with that. OK. So uh it, it, it, it, it, it happens a long

96
00:34:07.459 --> 00:34:11.149
time ago where we were in uh at Christmas time,

97
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:24.080
which is a place well known for bilingualism as you all know. Uh And uh yeah, so exactly. So, so we

98
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:31.520
were there at Christmas time. Uh there's uh in my grandfather's place and there was a bowl of fruit

99
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:36.080
in the middle of the table with uh coffee crips, half of the coffee crips in it, the chocolate bar,

100
00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:42.080
you know that. Yeah, so that was there. And one of my sister uh asked my mother. we were Children.

101
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:48.600
Uh I want to ask my mother uh if she could have that chocolate bar, but it was an hour before uh

102
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:54.969
lunch. So she said no, no, you won't have the chocolate bar. Uh So perfect. My mother, as I

103
00:34:54.979 --> 00:35:02.360
mentioned, five kids, I'm the oldest 44 sister, younger. So obviously doesn't have to say anything

104
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:09.149
but she's a saint. Ok. Five kids you can imagine So a lot of things happening in our mind in a day

105
00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:18.550
with Children that are just being Children. And then my second. So that was the second sister.

106
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:24.780
Number one, the sister, number two come maybe 15 minutes after and ask my mother if she could add

107
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:35.229
that coffee groups and my mother in uh unprecedented moment of inattention. OK? Something that

108
00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:42.010
rarely happened to her. She was in the moon. Sometimes she really needed to go elsewhere because

109
00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:52.169
having five kids steady schedules of at you, you, you see the picture she, she was somewhere

110
00:35:52.179 --> 00:35:58.709
somewhere in her mind and she said yes to my second sister. And she came back obviously with her

111
00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:07.709
mouth full to sister number one. And that's where we're nearly achieved World War Three. Uh And you

112
00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:13.739
can imagine the drama that my mother had to manage. So fast forward that 15 years after we're in a

113
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:23.560
cottage with all my sisters, there's a bowl of fruit in that cottage with a Coffee Crisp in that bowl

114
00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:30.179
of fruit. And we were all coveted that coffee crips. And then out of nowhere, sister number one,

115
00:36:30.189 --> 00:36:37.899
like a tires on his brain. I want that. That's my coffee Crips. I've been suffering that injustice

116
00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:44.500
for too long. It's mine and mine alone almost crying. So, so she took that coffee crips and

117
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:51.949
obviously, uh we realized at that time that she's not been able to forgive what has happened with

118
00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:59.110
sister number two. And with my mother, So today is about the importance of forgiveness, you

119
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.850
understand? Yeah, So,

120
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:10.719
that, that the slight and draw using something that is really trivial, obviously. But there's a key

121
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:18.270
element when we're thinking about relationship with other forgiveness takes a huge part and I don't

122
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.290
want to take shortcuts and, and I know we could talk for months about relationship with other

123
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:30.260
relationship with other seeing different components. But forgiveness is a key elements and we'll

124
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:36.169
just go to the Lord's prayer. Jesus at, at some point, showed us a prayer, an example of prayer, a

125
00:37:36.179 --> 00:37:45.139
template and look at that template prayer right now. It's in Matthew 16 verse 18. So uh and uh

126
00:37:45.149 --> 00:37:53.459
exactly um sorry Matthew six verse 9 to 15 or father in heaven. And we all know that usually uh let

127
00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:58.879
your name remain holy. Bring about your kingdom, manifest your will here on earth as it is manifest

128
00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:06.830
in heaven. Give us each day that day's bread no more, no less and forgive us our depths as we

129
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:13.370
forgive those who owe us something. lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. But let

130
00:38:13.379 --> 00:38:18.590
your kingdom be and let it powerful and glorious forever. Amen. So that's the template Jesus is

131
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:29.870
talking to his disciples and and he gave them that kind of template to pray and

132
00:38:29.879 --> 00:38:36.879
this is some kind of a daily template that we could use to pray, to pray, to pray our God. So

133
00:38:36.889 --> 00:38:42.350
there's different component, but the only component in that prayer that touches relationship with

134
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:48.830
other is not asking God help me to be more patient. God asked me, helped me to be more kind. God

135
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:55.459
helped me to raise my kid appropriately. God helped me to uh be a good worker. God helped me. It's

136
00:38:55.469 --> 00:39:01.040
not about any of those aspect of a relationship which I believe is the good aspect and that deserve

137
00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:07.699
some kind of focus as well. But in that prayer, the emphasis that is made is on forgiveness. So it

138
00:39:07.709 --> 00:39:15.520
seems to A and if it wasn't enough Jesus at the end of the prayer, after giving to his disciples,

139
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:22.040
the template of the prayer is putting an emphasis on the one thing in the old prayer. And is it, is

140
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:27.850
that one, if you forgive people, when they sin against you, then your father will forgive you when

141
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:33.830
you sin against him and when you sin against your neighbor and, and when you sin again, but if you

142
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:39.939
do not forgive your neighbors sins, you will, your father will not forgive your sins. And that's

143
00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:51.030
really kind of surprising because typically, uh we're not used to that kind of clear cut um absence

144
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:57.459
that clear cut reciprocity, exactly reciprocity. And Jesus is saying, if you're not

145
00:39:57.469 --> 00:40:02.350
exercising forgiveness, I will not exercise forgiveness toward you. And let's, let's pause for a

146
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.959
second. Obviously, when we want to enter in relationship with God, no matter what happened in our

147
00:40:07.969 --> 00:40:13.159
past, this has been forgiven and there's nothing that needs to be done on our part. We just need to

148
00:40:13.169 --> 00:40:18.919
accept that grace, that gift from God and that's it. That's all we don't need to forgive anybody. ju

149
00:40:18.929 --> 00:40:23.830
just ask forgiveness to God and enter in a relationship with him and that's it. Nothing is required

150
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:30.030
from us. But as soon as we inter with the in relationship with God, there is some kind of a daily

151
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:36.469
maintenance that needs to happen. With us, towards other and towards God. And obviously we sin every

152
00:40:36.479 --> 00:40:42.580
day. Usually people probably the the 30 person that have difficulty to wake up this morning, the

153
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:49.310
rest are uh are, are, are probably not sinning sin. But for most of us sins are happening in

154
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.570
different point in times in our life. And there's a daily maintenance that Jesus is asking us to do

155
00:40:54.580 --> 00:41:00.550
by asking forgiveness to God and being able to exercise forgiveness to other if we're not doing that.

156
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:08.570
that's really clear. There's a line trace God will not forgive us or our, our daily sin and we will

157
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:14.959
severe that part of the relationship with God. We will not have the, the full benefits of that

158
00:41:14.969 --> 00:41:20.550
relationship with God. But that's the challenge and, and, and, and that's a real challenge. And

159
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:26.479
that's the reason why I wanted to show that verse immediately just to put in perspective, why we're

160
00:41:26.489 --> 00:41:32.639
talking, we're talking about forgiveness at the end at the end of our day in relationship with right

161
00:41:32.649 --> 00:41:40.610
relationship with other, apparently if we want to have success on that part of our life having right

162
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:46.739
relationship with other forgiveness will be a key part of that. So that's the reason why I wanted to

163
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:52.600
uh have some exchange with you this morning about forgiveness. But forgiveness is obviously

164
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:58.179
something that I'm not taking lightly. Ok? And I, and I mention that immediately right now because

165
00:41:58.189 --> 00:42:05.300
obviously people are doing wrong to us each day, ok? And we are inflicting wrong things to people

166
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:12.790
and this is always in a different kind of magnitude, ok? And obviously, the people that are hurting

167
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:19.719
us are hurting more than what we hurt people typically in our mind. OK? That's the kind of balance

168
00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:26.060
that is happening. And, but still on both sides, we need that forgiveness to occur in, in our

169
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:33.949
relationship. But these are the kind of items that we can Envision forgiveness potentially, not

170
00:42:33.959 --> 00:42:40.030
always easy, but we can't envision now what I was saying that I'm not taking that topic lightly is

171
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:49.959
that there is things that are unfathomable behavior that are done from a human being to another one.

172
00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:56.780
Let's talk about any example of violence, any example of abuse on people that have no defense and

173
00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:02.540
any kind of. really, really bad thing that, that we could. Um

174
00:43:04.699 --> 00:43:11.479
if you could inflict to each other. And when we're thinking about these elements, forgiveness is

175
00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:19.040
something that is completely, it could easily be completely out of reach and being here this morning

176
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:24.659
and telling you that we can't forgive everything and that forgiveness is a key part you can see in

177
00:43:24.669 --> 00:43:30.370
your mind, you and you have no idea of what I've been living or what I've been through. I would say

178
00:43:30.379 --> 00:43:38.429
to you, I totally agree and I full of compassion. Ok? But I know someone that knows exactly how you

179
00:43:38.439 --> 00:43:45.750
feel. But, and let's unfold that message today and see if this forgiveness is still possible even in

180
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:56.649
that kind of extremely difficult situation. So And for those of you who are a little bit worried

181
00:43:56.659 --> 00:44:01.709
about the timer, don't worry because last time I forgot the timer after I've done seven minutes,

182
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:12.310
I've started it. Ok. So don't worry, it's under control so far. OK? So, um coming back to our topic

183
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:19.889
today. So Jesus is saying forgiveness is a real important part when you're thinking about

184
00:44:19.899 --> 00:44:25.959
relationship with other, But it's not in that verse in, in Chapter six, when we're, he's really

185
00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:32.500
talking to uh is this his disciples? And uh it's the sermon on the mountains and people that are

186
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:39.070
following him that he is really expla explaining fully the forgiveness and what this is all about.

187
00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:48.760
It's a little bit later in Matthew 18 when he's giving us the parable of the unforgiving debtor. and

188
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:56.679
I will ask the voice of the church to read that parable Then Peter came to him and asked Lord, how

189
00:44:56.689 --> 00:45:03.489
often should I forgive someone who sins against me? Seven times. No, not seven times. Jesus replied,

190
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:10.389
but 70 times seven, Therefore, the kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring

191
00:45:10.399 --> 00:45:16.479
the accounts up to date with his servants who had borrowed money from him. In the process, one of

192
00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:23.070
his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars. he couldn't pay. So his master ordered

193
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:30.760
that he be sold along with his wife, his Children and everything he owned to pay the debt. But the

194
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:36.169
man fell down before his master and begged him, please be patient with me and I will pay it all.

195
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.850
Then his master was filled with pity for him and he released him and forgave his death. But when the

196
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:49.050
man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few $1000. He grabbed him by the

197
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:55.840
throat and demanded instant payment. his fellow servant fell down before him and begged him for a

198
00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:02.149
little more time. Be patient with me and I will pay it. He pleaded. But his creditor wouldn't wait.

199
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:07.840
He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full. When some of the

200
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:13.439
other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that

201
00:46:13.449 --> 00:46:19.870
had happened. Then the king called in the man, he had forgiven and said, you evil servant, I forgave

202
00:46:19.879 --> 00:46:25.360
you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me. Shouldn't you have mercy on your fellow

203
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:32.189
servant just as I had mercy on you. Then the angry king set the man to prison to be tortured until

204
00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:39.770
he had paid his entire. That's why my Heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to give forgive

205
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:48.189
your brothers and sisters from your heart. Ok. Thank you Ben. So I I in that story, really, Jesus is

206
00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:54.570
exemplifying what forgiveness is about because that story and and this really needs to be extremely

207
00:46:54.580 --> 00:47:01.830
clear in, in our mind is not about how dealing, how to deal with relationship with a business

208
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.370
partner, how to manage debt together and how to do a proper accounting of that. That's the context

209
00:47:07.379 --> 00:47:13.889
of that is really Peter is asking how many times will I need to forgive someone? And Jesus is saying

210
00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:20.350
to him that parable, so that the idea of that verse is really that verse of that chapter. That

211
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:29.090
illustration from God is to demonstrate us. What forgiveness is about? What kind of rule are uh are

212
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:35.379
we dealing with when we're talking about forgiveness? And, and one of the first thing that is really

213
00:47:35.389 --> 00:47:41.610
critical and really important to grasp in forgiveness. And if we're coming also back to the verse

214
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:52.620
that we have in Matthew six, in the, in Jesus Prayer is forgiving um forgiving others. As I I it is

215
00:47:52.629 --> 00:48:00.729
a reason or a critical element to be able to receive uh forgiveness from God. So, and forgive us our

216
00:48:00.739 --> 00:48:06.820
debts as we forgive those who owe us some things. And the, the language here is the same thing that

217
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:12.860
they use after is about debts. When we're thinking about an offence, so if you've been offended by

218
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:18.389
someone, it's like you have a ledger and then you write something, the name of the person and the,

219
00:48:18.399 --> 00:48:24.340
the amount that it's owing you. That's what the wrong that person made you And that's that

220
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:29.949
illustration that is consistently used through the capture. The scripture is talking about the depth

221
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:43.750
and and a debt that is eventually eliminated. So about that: how can we envisage that kind of

222
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:50.050
reciprocity? And I found a beautiful illustration that that and I'll just read it because I don't

223
00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:58.949
want to mistranslate it to you. So forgiveness is more like the air in your lungs. There

224
00:48:58.959 --> 00:49:06.340
is only room for you to inhale the next lung full when you've just breathed out. The previous one,

225
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:13.014
if you insist on withholding it, refusing to give someone else the kiss of life, they may

226
00:49:13.024 --> 00:49:20.564
desperately need. You won't be able to take any more air yourself and you will suffocate very

227
00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:28.155
quickly. So that kind of relationship with the forgiveness. When Jesus is asking us to asking, we

228
00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:36.020
are receiving forgiveness, we're inhaling forgiveness from God. and then we're able, when we're

229
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:43.229
exhaling to give forgiveness to others, there's that kind of flow that needs to happen. Otherwise

230
00:49:43.239 --> 00:49:51.989
we're gonna lack air ourselves and not be able also to, to achieve what we're supposed to do, which

231
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.100
is really forgiving others. So in the parable, and one of the things that is really helpful also to

232
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:05.500
understand how can forgiveness could be something that we could apply in our own life. And one of

233
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:12.590
the lessons that we found in that parable is the fact that forgiveness is not excusing nor

234
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:21.510
acknowledging that justice has been done. Ok? So forgiveness in that story, the king would have been

235
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:31.270
in his right to really obtain the money that would have been justice. Justice is you pay me and that

236
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:40.510
will be it at the end of the depth towards me. But forgiveness is really not about having justice

237
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:47.770
being done. It's about purely an act of compassion. And sometimes in our lives, there will be

238
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:55.610
trouble that we're gonna face and justice will happen either on this earth or in another time on

239
00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:02.199
another realm, but justice will happen. But what we learn in that parable is the fact that justice

240
00:51:02.209 --> 00:51:09.300
is not required to exercise forgiveness. So that's super important because think about the situation

241
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:14.250
where we need to go to the tribunal and, and, and, and, and, and you're waiting for something or

242
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:19.520
wrong that has been done to you and you're holding that through the whole process of your life. And

243
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:27.419
sometimes it's super long but just justice is not a prerequisite for forgiveness. That's what we, we

244
00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:35.199
learned from that parable and as well as excuses, neither. I will forgive him or her if she excuse

245
00:51:35.209 --> 00:51:42.629
me. But that guy in the parable never came back saying, oh, I, I, I I'm so sorry that I took so much

246
00:51:42.639 --> 00:51:48.050
money for you. I'm so sorry that I mismanage there was no sorry at all. He just say I will pay it

247
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:59.580
all so there was no excuses. So forgiveness is not dependent of that part of justice being done, of

248
00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:05.280
excuse being received. So that's first part about forgiveness that we learn from that parable. The

249
00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:13.820
second part that we learn is that that we learn is forgiveness does not requires trust in the other

250
00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:22.399
person. And it's not neither a guarantee that we will establish trust with the person that offended

251
00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:29.010
us, ok? And this is really also super important when we're thinking about unfathomable things that

252
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:35.010
could have happened in our lives. Ok? So it's not because I will release someone and I will say in

253
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:43.929
my ledger, OK, there was Joan my name, I I and that someone I I've heard someone. So in the name of

254
00:52:43.939 --> 00:52:50.989
that person, there's my name and there's an amount And that amount there, if someone is saying, OK,

255
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:59.699
you want, you owe me 1000. I just not erasing minus 1000 then equals zero. I haven't forgot anything

256
00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:04.669
that people haven't forgot what I've done wrong. OK? When we're forgiving someone, it's not about

257
00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:09.939
forgetting and then moving on again in that relationship or with that person that hurt us or

258
00:53:09.949 --> 00:53:16.020
whatever. We're not losing memory when we're forgiving someone. That's not what it is about at all.

259
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:23.040
And it's neither, A new relationship or we are trusting that person even in that parable. What is

260
00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:29.939
mentioned uh by the servant is that please be patient with me. I will pay it all. The guy said I

261
00:53:29.949 --> 00:53:38.719
will pay it all. And but the worth of that was 500 lifetime. OK? of work in terms of what was

262
00:53:38.729 --> 00:53:45.429
required to pay the debt. So it was impossible. But that's what the servant, said to the the king,

263
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:53.479
but the king obviously didn't believe that it wasn't based on um the the trust that their servant

264
00:53:53.489 --> 00:54:00.530
will do better or will manage better or admit is wrong or it wasn't about that. It was again purely

265
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:05.229
out of an act of compassion because obviously, in the circumstances, the king would have say you

266
00:54:05.239 --> 00:54:13.459
won't be able to put pay me that ever, you're probably even a liar. So that was even not in the mind

267
00:54:13.469 --> 00:54:18.889
of the king when he exercised forgiveness. So when we exercise forgiveness, it's not about

268
00:54:18.899 --> 00:54:27.590
reestablishing trust with that person, and reestablishing relationship because unless this, the, the

269
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:35.530
person that hurt us speak the truth about what they have done and change their mind and their

270
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:42.800
behavior, eventually relationship could be reestablished. But when we're doing the forgiveness,

271
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:49.610
forgiveness part, we're releasing that other person first in our mind. Ok? And we clear that from

272
00:54:49.699 --> 00:54:59.100
our own life, being able also to process and go a little bit more deeper in the pain. Uh and uh the

273
00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:05.669
healing process of our pain that we experience. So that's the first step to be able to release that

274
00:55:05.679 --> 00:55:12.600
person. for us, primarily more than the other person. And it's not a guarantee that there will be

275
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:18.260
reconciliation and that trust will flourish and strive in that relationship again. Not at all.

276
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:26.989
Forgiveness is not about trusting the other person or adding another relation. Uh Having a trust, a

277
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.689
trusty relationship with that person. so finally it brings us to the last component that forgiveness

278
00:55:33.699 --> 00:55:42.139
will prevails us, will free us from evil. That's the last component that we're seeing also in that

279
00:55:42.149 --> 00:55:48.370
parable because what we're seeing in that in that situation, just grab the,

280
00:55:53.689 --> 00:56:01.919
the example that we we received from the good king and the bad servant again What Jesus is trying to

281
00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:08.969
explain to Peter is forgiveness. So he gives, he gives, he gives two example, one, he gave two

282
00:56:08.979 --> 00:56:17.229
example, one about a good example and a bad example. So if you want to be free from the hold and the

283
00:56:17.239 --> 00:56:25.810
grip that evil has on your life and that keep you stuck with forgiveness, not being released, just

284
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:32.219
keeping you stuck in your life. The key for that if you want to be free from that old on your life

285
00:56:32.229 --> 00:56:40.629
is about being able to forgive what has been done to us. That's a key to be able to free us from

286
00:56:40.639 --> 00:56:49.639
evil. ourselves. So, so it's, it's pretty at that point. It's pretty and it's ok because we need to

287
00:56:49.649 --> 00:56:56.669
understand that we're not hurting the offender. We're mostly hurting ourselves when we're not giving

288
00:56:56.679 --> 00:57:02.600
forgiveness The second thing about that, and you'll see that also in the example that I just want to

289
00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:09.479
share with you is that not only you're stuck in your life and you're blocking your life and your

290
00:57:09.489 --> 00:57:17.780
relationship with God on that component and impairing Him to bring healing in your life. Ok? There's

291
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:24.439
another component. If this would have been solved in your life, you'd be able to give back that

292
00:57:24.449 --> 00:57:31.699
component when you exercise forgiveness towards other is blocked because you're still, you, you, you

293
00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:36.524
have received your forgiveness, you're stuck in that part. You're not able to exercise that through

294
00:57:36.534 --> 00:57:42.094
that person. So you're black at that stage in your life and you're not able to move forward with the

295
00:57:42.104 --> 00:57:46.844
other plans and the other steps that you can do with your life because that's kind of an area in

296
00:57:46.854 --> 00:57:53.989
your life in our life that we decided. No this is just too much I can, I can deal with that. I don't

297
00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.169
want to deal with that. But beautiful things could unfold from that. But that is impairing us. And

298
00:58:00.179 --> 00:58:06.860
that's the reason why we're saying that forgiveness frees us from evil. So let me show you uh a

299
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:12.659
quick example about that. That will really recap everything we've mentioned this morning. That

300
00:58:12.669 --> 00:58:22.100
example is about uh Ray uh he's a guy that came from Bangladesh. Uh Anybody heard about that guy OK,

301
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:29.020
perfect. Awesome. You really like that story? I think. So, Ray Boan, uh a guy that came from

302
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:36.479
Bangladesh immigrates in the US. Um a little bit before September 11th, uh 10 days after September

303
00:58:36.489 --> 00:58:43.889
11th, he was working in a gas station uh, working in a gas station. I'll just do a long

304
00:58:43.899 --> 00:58:49.139
story short with that. So I'll skip a lot of things because for a matter of the time But you'll keep

305
00:58:49.149 --> 00:58:58.129
the ID anyway. So a guy entered 10 days after September 11th, uh, a guy, white supremacist enter in

306
00:58:58.139 --> 00:59:07.649
that gas station shot him in the face. That's it. Uh, so 36 38 bullets fragments in his face. Uh,

307
00:59:07.659 --> 00:59:19.120
lost eye - lost vision of one eye, lost his girlfriend, lost money. A spiral of, bad thing

308
00:59:19.129 --> 00:59:26.739
happening that you could imagine. And that guy Mark Stroman, that's the killer name that's uh he

309
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:31.699
killed two, he killed two other person on that night. He admitted his crime. He's been sentenced to

310
00:59:31.709 --> 00:59:41.719
death. OK? So eight years after that uh Mark uh not Mark but Ray uh that that guy here uh Ray uh was

311
00:59:41.729 --> 00:59:50.739
doing a pilgrimage to uh to Mecca and it was really, it was really still not being able to process

312
00:59:50.750 --> 01:00:00.449
everything that has happened in his life. And, in that pilgrimage. After that. He said, I would like

313
01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:08.600
it. He decided to save his life as sin so that the decision he took after eight years of processing

314
01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:15.060
that pain, he decided to save the life of his assassin. and what this is what he said, he said,

315
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:23.419
instead of hating him, and we're trying, we're talking about forgiveness. It's like hands that we

316
01:00:23.429 --> 01:00:28.760
have around the neck of the other person. It's tight. We don't want to choke them, but just a little

317
01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:36.919
bit having difficulty to breathe. Ok? So sometimes we using a little bit more or less, ok? But

318
01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:44.919
That's what he said. He said, instead of hating him, I saw him as a human being like me, not just a

319
01:00:44.929 --> 01:00:54.429
killer. He said I saw him and that is really important. I saw him as a victim too. And I deeply felt

320
01:00:54.439 --> 01:01:02.770
by executing him. We would simply lose a human life without dealing with the root cause And I saw

321
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:13.939
him as a victim because in this word world, we're all all victim of the, the the that is uh at work,

322
01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:21.560
whether your, your knowledge of uh uh uh of believing in, in bad spirit or a bad, no matter what's

323
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:28.290
the form. But there is bad at work in this world. And there's many example of that and in a way or

324
01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:37.129
in another, we are some kind of a victim. And again, I'll put that all in the context of the really

325
01:01:37.139 --> 01:01:43.090
deep humility that I'm addressing the subject of forgiveness. Because again, depending on what

326
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.879
things we're talking about, sometimes it's even extremely difficult to see that that person, the

327
01:01:48.889 --> 01:01:58.520
perp perpetrate perpetrator, is a victim, ok? It, it, it could completely blow our mind and I

328
01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:06.629
totally understand that. But in that case, that guy's been shot in the face and he's able to

329
01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:13.780
understand in some way, a glimpse of something that that guy is also a victim. He's been a terrible

330
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:21.419
victim, Ray himself. But Mark in a certain way was also evicted. So anyway, so and look at the TED

331
01:02:21.659 --> 01:02:26.810
uh there's a TEDx talk if you, you prefer. So look at the TED or if you wanna learn more about that

332
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:35.250
story, a amazing story. But again, Mark, uh I, I've heard about Ray trying to save his life. So Mark

333
01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:43.610
wrote a letter to uh Ray to apologize for the pain he caused. Uh And he said he regor all of the

334
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:50.100
lesson he learned at the end of an abusive stepfather. So we're not going more in that, that

335
01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:57.239
direction, but there was still some pain that Mark had to, to process and some kind of trajectory in

336
01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:04.790
his life that leads him to, to perpetrate that kind of act. And then so eventually he's, he's been

337
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:13.610
executed. But an hour, a few hours before he's being executed, Ray decided uh in fact, not Ray, but

338
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:21.879
Mark decided to call Ray and Ray spoke first by saying March Ok. So that guy here is saying to his

339
01:03:21.889 --> 01:03:31.679
assassin Mark, I never hated you I forgive you. That's what he said just before he said that to him,

340
01:03:31.689 --> 01:03:37.360
like a couple of hours before that guy being sentenced to death, then Mark answered back to him. I

341
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:45.699
never expected this from you. I love you, bro. and then finally, uh obviously, when Ray heard that

342
01:03:45.709 --> 01:03:48.229
he, he, he felt just like crying

343
01:03:50.649 --> 01:03:58.229
So in these terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible circumstances, there's that kind of good that

344
01:03:58.239 --> 01:04:04.939
blossom from a bad situation. And there's, there's some verse that uh come in Romans eight chapter

345
01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:10.590
28 when we're seeing like in the gospel that anything will produce some good after.

346
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:20.860
So God will use, even if there is bad thing, we'll use that to to good outcomes difficult. That's

347
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:28.489
kind of mastercard kind of credit card affirmation that you can load on everything and, but this is

348
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:34.209
real stuff and you can see that in that circumstances. And Ray has just developed an incredible

349
01:04:34.219 --> 01:04:42.989
credible organization, fighting violence, fighting life sentence, incredible amount of things

350
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.959
toward forgiveness and handing, trying to end violence. But imagine if Ray would have been stuck. in

351
01:04:51.969 --> 01:05:02.090
not forgiving uh Mike. What would have happened and to push the story even Ray even called after he

352
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:10.560
died, he called eventually his son of Mark that was in jail at his turn. He offered exam just blew

353
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:21.810
in your mind is just a nonsense, non reciprocity, none, really just pure act of compassion, pure act

354
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:31.679
of forgiveness. As stated, in the example of the uh uh unforgiving debtor, that beautiful example of

355
01:05:31.689 --> 01:05:37.610
forgiveness. So now just to recap what we mentioned this morning, we're maybe thinking about

356
01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:44.370
elements in our life, people in our life wrongs that has been done to us that we have a hard time to

357
01:05:44.379 --> 01:05:52.219
be able to process. so, so my prayer this morning is would you please consider to be able firstly in

358
01:05:52.229 --> 01:05:59.449
your mind, in your heart to release this person, remove your hand around the neck of the person that

359
01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:05.290
you would like to choke right now. OK. That will be one of my prayer for you this morning. And also

360
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:14.530
if you are completely unable to do that, That's absolutely OK. You can ask God for his help in that

361
01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:19.540
specific situation. He won't ask us something that is behind our strength. That's absolutely

362
01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:24.959
impossible. So you're not alone in that journey. What he asked from us is, is desperately committed

363
01:06:24.969 --> 01:06:31.959
to help us achieve that in our life But if you haven't taste that from God, that, that forgiveness

364
01:06:31.969 --> 01:06:39.399
from your own life, realizing the own depth that you add your own ledger where your name is written.

365
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:46.149
And if you haven't experiment also the forgiveness of God, that certainly will be a first good step

366
01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:53.590
for you. Just asking God Jesus, I give you my life. I just want you to empty my ledger and I want to

367
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.350
start new. So let's stand and pray together.

368
01:07:01.399 --> 01:07:09.330
Jesus. Thank you so much for this wonderful example that you have been when you were on the earth,

369
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:17.439
the way you've been able to forgive the people that killed you people that mistreated you, the

370
01:07:17.449 --> 01:07:25.500
people that hurt you. You've been that perfect example, made it possible. Also for us being here

371
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:32.560
today, being able to consider removing hands around the neck of someone that hurt us So please, this

372
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:40.989
morning, I ask you for your strength, your holy spirit that help us how to make that first step,

373
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.669
being able to forgive someone that is really impairing us to move forward in our life. And for

374
01:07:47.679 --> 01:07:56.290
anybody here that has not have the opportunity to taste your forgiveness first. I want you to listen

375
01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:01.479
to these heart that are craving from you and saying Jesus, I want to give you my life. Can you

376
01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:13.560
please empty my ledger? So in Your name, we're praying this morning, amen. Bye. cool. I thank you so

377
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.760
much for your time this morning. Have a good Sunday.

378
01:08:23.049 --> 01:08:33.039
Wow, can we just give Johann another round of applause? Um And the reason is I know that he doesn't

379
01:08:33.088 --> 01:08:42.809
take preparing for Sunday's lighting. He he really puts all of his uh heart and attention into it.

380
01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:49.919
So I just want to honor him. And I also want to let you know that. You know, we're here playing

381
01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:55.410
music and singing. But I want you to know that as a team, as the worship team, we've been praying

382
01:08:55.419 --> 01:09:02.529
for you. We pray for you throughout the week. And um those of the worship team that are in over here,

383
01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:08.879
you know, can you please clap and let them know like where you're at and that who, who's praying for

384
01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:13.029
them just clap right now, just to Those in the worship team.

385
01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:21.540
Cool. Yeah, because our heart's desire is one to keep the main thing, the main thing and to glorify

386
01:09:21.549 --> 01:09:29.109
God with our talents. But the second thing is so that you leave here, different from how you came,

387
01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:36.549
And I just want to share that, you know, sometimes and I'm gonna speak for myself. But if you can

388
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:43.350
relate to, you know, that's good. But sometimes I feel like I need to be good. I need to be perfect.

389
01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:49.970
I need to have it all together to be enough for God and to or just to like be in his presence, I

390
01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:56.040
need to like be the perfect daughter and you know, just this Wednesday um something came to the

391
01:09:56.049 --> 01:10:02.799
surface again. I, I lived a lot of different types of abuse and I was a mess on Wednesday like

392
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:10.040
anybody who I talk to, they're like, hey, Iris, what's up? I'm like, you know, like just like break,

393
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:17.810
break into tears all day long, canceled work. You know, Um But at the same time, I was able to be

394
01:10:17.819 --> 01:10:22.799
used by God mightily in different ways and the different things that I did during the week. And so I

395
01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:30.149
just wanna remind myself and us that, you know, we can live in the tension of being broken and

396
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:38.500
blessed. and that you're enough Pressure off you are enough for God and God loves you. And so this

397
01:10:38.509 --> 01:10:47.500
next song gonna sing about how we love God and how much we need him. and he's totally there. He's

398
01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:50.419
