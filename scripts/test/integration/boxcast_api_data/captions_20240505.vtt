00:18:00.349 --> 00:18:07.900
encourage you that he is what matters, whatever you're going through, whatever you're experiencing.

NOTE confidence=1.0

42
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:15.329
Like Iris said, we're just gonna focus on him and we're just gonna give our lives to him and this

NOTE confidence=1.0

43
00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:22.660
song to him, he matters. So I just wanna encourage you with that. I really feel that so strongly

NOTE confidence=1.0

44
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:30.030
that whatever you come in with, it matters to him, it matters to him, it matters to him. And we just

NOTE confidence=1.0

45
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.989
want distractions to fall away that you would just focus on him. And when you sing to him, you're

NOTE confidence=1.0

46
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.670
reminding your soul what he's the truth. You're reminding the truth about who you are and who he is.

NOTE confidence=1.0

47
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:52.089
So we're going to sing this together and I want to hear every voice. I want to hear every voice just

NOTE confidence=1.0

48
00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:59.189
really as you're lifting up the song to him. Just know that he loves to hear you sing. He loves to

NOTE confidence=1.0

49
00:18:59.199 --> 00:19:13.180
hear your voice. He loves it. It's a beautiful sound. He has walked every voice he has won upon the

NOTE confidence=1.0

50
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:30.810
ok. The sea was gone with just a word. Him. He has fought the raging war of sorrow when he speaks a

NOTE confidence=1.0

51
00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:39.810
wisp of shells with it. I see a miracle. I see a miracle.

NOTE confidence=1.0

52
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:50.459
The grave, the one we thought was dead has come to love. Well, again, I see

NOTE confidence=1.0

53
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.609
cool. Every chick break the power of he

NOTE confidence=1.0

54
00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:00.780
with

NOTE confidence=1.0

55
00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:10.109
come on resurrection roars through you as you sing this out, he's inside of you. He's alive. Ok?

NOTE confidence=1.0

56
00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:18.150
We're gonna lift him up. He will lift, oh, he will lift, anxious and

NOTE confidence=1.0

57
00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:21.390
holy.

NOTE confidence=1.0

58
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.959
So good.

NOTE confidence=1.0

59
00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:34.140
This one when you sing this out, you're surrendering. You're not making him bigger than any right

NOTE confidence=1.0

60
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:40.869
now. We make it bigger than that. We declare he is bigger than what you're going through. Oh, this

NOTE confidence=1.0

61
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.469
is what your worship does

NOTE confidence=1.0

62
00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:33.420
Mm. Oh He came Jesus.

NOTE confidence=1.0

63
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:07.819
So good morning, everyone you may be seated. Uh It's the first Sunday of the month and as it has

NOTE confidence=1.0

64
00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:12.979
been announced, uh in the last, the last couple of months, first Sunday of the month is the

NOTE confidence=1.0

65
00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:20.250
communion. So uh we'll take this uh moment uh in our gathering to share uh a little meeting, a

NOTE confidence=1.0

66
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:29.810
modest meal uh together this morning. So I'll ask uh the usher team to uh distribute uh the elements

NOTE confidence=1.0

67
00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:36.319
this morning as a remaining there. And, and by the way, so I, I'm Johan. Uh I'm part of the overseer

NOTE confidence=1.0

68
00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:39.099
team here uh in river's edge. Um Oh

NOTE confidence=1.0

69
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:48.160
uh So I'm part of the overseer themes there in a river's edge. Uh Lorenzo and his uh their family

NOTE confidence=1.0

70
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:55.329
are away uh this morning. So I have the privilege of uh replacing him also for the message. So,

NOTE confidence=1.0

71
00:27:55.339 --> 00:28:02.449
about communion, what communion is about? It's always a good thing to remind that it's not. Um II I

NOTE confidence=1.0

72
00:28:02.459 --> 00:28:08.969
it's ob obviously something symbolic. We won't share a complete meal together. We've done that. Uh

NOTE confidence=1.0

73
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:15.020
Last Sunday with the community kitchen. Uh Did you enjoy your, your meal? Uh last Sunday with the

NOTE confidence=1.0

74
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.729
community kitchen. Yeah. By clapping. Yeah.

NOTE confidence=1.0

75
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:26.800
Uh If you would have said no, I would have said you were a liar because there was nothing left at

NOTE confidence=1.0

76
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:35.280
the end. OK. So I'm just kidding. Uh But it was a wonderful uh uh community uh brunch that we

NOTE confidence=1.0

77
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:42.010
enjoyed together. And that's also the spirit of the communion also uh in the communion. What we're,

NOTE confidence=1.0

78
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:50.640
we're doing together. We're reminder we are, it is a reminder of that moment that Jesus had with his

NOTE confidence=1.0

79
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:59.459
disciples uh many, like 2000 years ago when he enjoyed and share a meal with all his disciple, one

NOTE confidence=1.0

80
00:28:59.469 --> 00:29:09.859
last meal with them. Uh And this, as we said, also a month ago, that that reminder of that meal was

NOTE confidence=1.0

81
00:29:09.869 --> 00:29:19.170
also about one thing is the celebration, the time that Jesus was enjoying that true moment with the

NOTE confidence=1.0

82
00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:25.599
presence of other human being and just being able to share a meal, enjoy the company of this their

NOTE confidence=1.0

83
00:29:25.609 --> 00:29:31.290
disciples. So uh yes, we can go with the distribute, proceed with the distribution. And I'll pray.

NOTE confidence=1.0

84
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:37.449
OK. Uh Yeah, I'll pray after when the distribution will be completed. Yeah, perfect. So, uh and

NOTE confidence=1.0

85
00:29:37.459 --> 00:29:43.520
let's wait to each other. OK? For uh taking uh the elements, the elements, by the way, are a great

NOTE confidence=1.0

86
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:51.760
uh juice and a little piece of bread. Uh But for, for those who are uh worried about the alcohol

NOTE confidence=1.0

87
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:59.780
component of it. So uh this is great fruit. So having said that, so we'll wait each other uh for

NOTE confidence=1.0

88
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:04.579
that moment where we're gonna take that meal together. Uh And what I wanted to mention you this

NOTE confidence=1.0

89
00:30:04.589 --> 00:30:11.630
morning about that meal is that uh as I was saying, a reminder of the celebration that the time that

NOTE confidence=1.0

90
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:18.430
Jesus was enjoying having a meal altogether, that's what we are remembering. But of course, also,

NOTE confidence=1.0

91
00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:25.250
when we're sharing that meal together, it's also a declaration, a declaration that we believe that

NOTE confidence=1.0

92
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:37.459
Jesus and God became flesh 2000 years ago, that concept of incarnation like being fully human being

NOTE confidence=1.0

93
00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:45.270
there suffering with us alongside us, having tears in his eye as having pain is in his body being

NOTE confidence=1.0

94
00:30:45.489 --> 00:30:54.834
worn out after a day of work, using a hammer and eating his thumbs and, and finger and suffering

NOTE confidence=1.0

95
00:30:54.844 --> 00:31:02.035
from that. That's the life that Jesus had when he was with us. It was not something supernatural,

NOTE confidence=1.0

96
00:31:02.045 --> 00:31:09.405
unreal where uh hitting his, his finger with hammer was not doing anything bad to him. It just

NOTE confidence=1.0

97
00:31:09.415 --> 00:31:17.709
really fully experience life as we are experiencing right now. So when we're taking that meal, we

NOTE confidence=1.0

98
00:31:17.719 --> 00:31:26.089
are declaring that Jesus came 2000 years ago in a body like the one we're having right now and, and

NOTE confidence=1.0

99
00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:33.280
really having the full experience of a human being, but having also the full experience of a

NOTE confidence=1.0

100
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:39.430
relationship with God. When we're taking that meal, we are declaring that he came here in flesh,

NOTE confidence=1.0

101
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:46.300
that he has been resurrected after he died. And that one day we will be all together and this won't

NOTE confidence=1.0

102
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:54.150
be something surreal. It will be the same thing, the same palpable or touchable kind of elements.

NOTE confidence=1.0

103
00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:02.189
When Jesus said to us, he said, I, I will wait until my return to have one another. That the next

NOTE confidence=1.0

104
00:32:02.199 --> 00:32:08.910
time I will share wine with you, it will be only uh at my return and that will be not something on

NOTE confidence=1.0

105
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:14.135
the cloud, but it will be in a renewed earth, renewed element. Then we'll have this wonderful

NOTE confidence=1.0

106
00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:23.025
opportunity to share that meal uh with Jesus. So um I think we've completed with the uh element. So

NOTE confidence=1.0

107
00:32:23.035 --> 00:32:31.895
I just want to read you a quick verse. Um reminding a quick reminder about uh that moment when, when

NOTE confidence=1.0

108
00:32:31.905 --> 00:32:40.400
Jesus was eating with his disciples, while they were eating, Jesus took bread and when he had given

NOTE confidence=1.0

109
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:51.650
thanks, he broke it and give it to his disciples saying, take and eat. This is my body.

NOTE confidence=1.0

110
00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:00.640
So um we're gonna take a moment uh if you want to stand up, uh I, I'm just gonna pray for uh for

NOTE confidence=1.0

111
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:08.170
that moment where we're gonna take the bread altogether. So Jesus, we are remembering that moment

NOTE confidence=1.0

112
00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:19.530
2000 years ago when you took one last meal with your disciples, when you give also your life for us

NOTE confidence=1.0

113
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:29.410
and this morning altogether, uh we are declaring that you did these things 2000 years ago and that

NOTE confidence=1.0

114
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:38.010
you change your life forever by doing so as well in your name, we pray this morning. Amen. So you

NOTE confidence=1.0

115
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:38.839
may take to Brad,

NOTE confidence=1.0

116
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:54.420
then he took a cup and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them saying drink from it all of you.

NOTE confidence=1.0

117
00:33:55.239 --> 00:34:03.530
And, and this was real wine. We have grapefruit here, but this was real wine. And never, we, we

NOTE confidence=1.0

118
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:11.209
always always need to never forget that Jesus was not necessarily a party animal, but he was

NOTE confidence=1.0

119
00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:20.139
enjoying people company. He was enjoying sharing meal. He was enjoying the, the, the the opportunity

NOTE confidence=1.0

120
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:26.500
to exchange a real communication relationship with people around a good meal. That was the very

NOTE confidence=1.0

121
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:32.540
nature of Jesus. So, and yes, with a little bit of alcohol with, uh, obviously without losing

NOTE confidence=1.0

122
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:40.070
control. But that was what Jesus was. Exactly. So, sometimes we imagine that these incarnate kind of

NOTE confidence=1.0

123
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:48.618
Jesus, but that's the real nature. And eventually we'll have that party, Jesus with us. Modest party,

NOTE confidence=1.0

124
00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:53.718
Jesus. But, and I know you're laughing about that, but that's what the exact accusation of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

125
00:34:53.729 --> 00:34:59.708
people and the religious people of the time saying you're a, you're a party machine buddy. You're,

NOTE confidence=1.0

126
00:34:59.718 --> 00:35:04.989
you're not the teacher of the law, you're not you, you can't belong to God. Zap Bon San. What are

NOTE confidence=1.0

127
00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:11.989
you doing? So that's the kind of Jesus that we're announcing today as well. A Jesus that can enjoy

NOTE confidence=1.0

128
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:23.070
good time with people that really thrive and, and desire for relationship with us. So he said he

NOTE confidence=1.0

129
00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.879
took the cup and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them saying drink from it to all of you.

NOTE confidence=1.0

130
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:34.760
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out, which is powered out for many, for the

NOTE confidence=1.0

131
00:35:34.889 --> 00:35:43.120
forgiveness of sins. I'll tell you I will not drink from this fruit of the vine again from now on

NOTE confidence=1.0

132
00:35:43.129 --> 00:35:51.889
until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's kingdom. So

NOTE confidence=1.0

133
00:35:54.570 --> 00:36:01.409
in our, in the faith that one day we will be able to celebrate and have that meal with Jesus. Let's

NOTE confidence=1.0

134
00:36:01.419 --> 00:36:06.550
take that uh little sip of wine and grapefruit together.

NOTE confidence=1.0

135
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:20.439
So Jesus, we're so thankful for what you've done and it's a privilege to be gathered all together

NOTE confidence=1.0

136
00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:27.520
with that bounding, the bounding that you created when you came here. The fact that we are brother

NOTE confidence=1.0

137
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:36.280
and sister in your covenant, that new alliance that we have with you. We're not taking any of that

NOTE confidence=1.0

138
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:42.020
for granted. We're just saying thank you. We're just declaring that you're the Lord lord of our

NOTE confidence=1.0

139
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.679
lives and that you're still alive today. And that one day we'll be able to celebrate all together,

NOTE confidence=1.0

140
00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:55.860
taking a, a good glass of wine altogether or beer, whatever you prefer and your awesome name. We

NOTE confidence=1.0

141
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.889
pray this morning, Jesus. Amen.

NOTE confidence=1.0

142
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.169
You may be seated.

NOTE confidence=1.0

143
00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:16.429
Mhm.

NOTE confidence=1.0

144
00:43:21.659 --> 00:43:27.570
And Jesus. Thank you that you live. Thank you, that you're alive.

NOTE confidence=1.0

145
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:41.800
Thank you, God. Stay in this moment. Just stay in this moment with him as we sing to him, he sings

NOTE confidence=1.0

146
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:49.540
over. You just stay in this moment and let him minister to you. Let him flow through this room. Let

NOTE confidence=1.0

147
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:57.610
him minister to you, speak to your heart. He knows what you need. He knows what you need. Hm. You

NOTE confidence=1.0

148
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.139
would kid

NOTE confidence=1.0

149
00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:03.280
one week.

NOTE confidence=1.0

150
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.969
Hidden glory in creation. No,

NOTE confidence=1.0

151
00:44:19.419 --> 00:44:27.560
you are. What a beautiful name. What a beautiful name.

NOTE confidence=1.0

152
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:44.639
The name of bless Christ. My, what a beautiful name is. Nothing compares to that. What a beautiful

NOTE confidence=1.0

153
00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:49.310
name. Honey, she is.

NOTE confidence=1.0

154
00:44:53.199 --> 00:44:56.000
You didn't want heaven. Hello?

NOTE confidence=1.0

155
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:03.010
Jesus. We lift you up. Oh, we lift you up.

NOTE confidence=1.0

156
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:08.340
We live.

NOTE confidence=1.0

157
00:46:10.439 --> 00:46:16.830
Oh, we focus on you right now. God, wherever we are in the room, I pray that we would feel your fire

NOTE confidence=1.0

158
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:25.350
fall. Oh, as we sing to you, chains break doors open, we're calling out to heaven. Come on death

NOTE confidence=1.0

159
00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:41.790
could not hold, that's a word. Dad could not hold you the veil to you. You silent. Most of sin and

NOTE confidence=1.0

160
00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:47.929
the heavens are with praise

NOTE confidence=1.0

161
00:49:02.719 --> 00:49:06.699
He is worthy. Worthy is,

NOTE confidence=1.0

162
00:49:11.199 --> 00:49:17.399
can you sing that again? Holy something shifts. When it's singing. When you're singing, then it's

NOTE confidence=1.0

163
00:49:17.409 --> 00:49:23.870
gonna shift the atmosphere inside your heart living on his presence. What,

NOTE confidence=1.0

164
00:49:26.939 --> 00:49:27.790
what it is?

NOTE confidence=1.0

165
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:42.550
council?

NOTE confidence=1.0

166
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:10.000
Hey, I thank you Jesus. Yeah. Come on, sing your own song. Sing it out, sing it out, whatever comes

NOTE confidence=1.0

167
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:15.550
out. Thank you Jesus. The Bible says we sing to him with spontaneous song. We sing to him with

NOTE confidence=1.0

168
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:25.159
whatever our heart cries. It doesn't matter what it sounds like. Oh, how are we? We worship you God.

NOTE confidence=1.0

169
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:25.879
You're so good.

NOTE confidence=1.0

170
00:53:19.879 --> 00:53:20.739
everyone.

NOTE confidence=1.0

171
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:31.899
So as I was saying earlier, uh our dear uh pastor uh is away with his family. Um And uh I have the

NOTE confidence=1.0

172
00:53:31.909 --> 00:53:38.320
privilege to be with you uh for the message. But just before uh starting this message as I was

NOTE confidence=1.0

173
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:44.620
thinking about Lorenzo and his family. Um I thought about something that I wanted to share with you.

NOTE confidence=1.0

174
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:55.010
Uh We are incredibly blessed uh to have a family like the De La Forest family amongst us. Uh They

NOTE confidence=1.0

175
00:53:55.020 --> 00:54:04.729
are serving for many, many, many years, uh heart and, and muscles and everything of their uh being

NOTE confidence=1.0

176
00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:12.800
uh giving their life to that community. Uh serving us years after years. Uh Lorenzo uh of course, as

NOTE confidence=1.0

177
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:19.629
our lead pastor, the, the uh chief of all the operation here uh within River's Edge and also the

NOTE confidence=1.0

178
00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:28.489
daycare as well uh with Michelle uh responsible of the worship team as well. Uh Joshi is their son

NOTE confidence=1.0

179
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:34.969
who's serving uh in fact, who's leading the tech team and Kaya, of course, uh supporting the visual.

NOTE confidence=1.0

180
00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:41.379
She's usually sitting here just in front. So I thought about something that we could do uh to

NOTE confidence=1.0

181
00:54:41.389 --> 00:54:47.929
demonstrate them our appreciation and if they, they have moments uh because we all have moments of

NOTE confidence=1.0

182
00:54:47.939 --> 00:54:52.850
the discouragement, I'm not saying that they have, they are having any right now, but I'm just

NOTE confidence=1.0

183
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:57.979
saying it would be a good thing to maybe have a round of applause for them so they can rehearse and

NOTE confidence=1.0

184
00:54:57.989 --> 00:55:06.280
uh listen that back ever and ever again, if they are sometimes having doubts in their mind about how

NOTE confidence=1.0

185
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:10.639
we appreciate them? So does it make sense? Says Laur, so can we Yeah.

NOTE confidence=1.0

186
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:13.989
Mhm

NOTE confidence=1.0

187
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:27.120
So th thank you. So much, uh, for, uh, for that Cooper operation. And I think their size, um, I

NOTE confidence=1.0

188
00:55:27.129 --> 00:55:30.860
don't know if they're looking at the live stream now, but they probably have closed it at that

NOTE confidence=1.0

189
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:38.459
moment. But no, seriously, I know they, they, they really loved us and, uh, it's a, and, and it's a

NOTE confidence=1.0

190
00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:45.110
love that we, uh, that is really, uh, V LA. So that's something that we also share with them. We

NOTE confidence=1.0

191
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:52.260
dearly love them as well. So this morning, we're continuing in our series are worthy. Um And uh

NOTE confidence=1.0

192
00:55:52.270 --> 00:56:01.159
about uh message or a little exchange that typically not that much of an exchange. Have you noted?

NOTE confidence=1.0

193
00:56:01.169 --> 00:56:06.939
Like if, even if we want something that to be cooper or bilateral, it's something that more is

NOTE confidence=1.0

194
00:56:06.949 --> 00:56:13.260
happening a dialogue internally in your mind while I'm speaking. Not much more than something that

NOTE confidence=1.0

195
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:19.320
is a live exchange really. Uh But I think it's OK like that because I, I've seen and I've tried some,

NOTE confidence=1.0

196
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:24.629
I've tried that uh and it's pretty chaotic. So that's not necessarily a good thing. But if you have

NOTE confidence=1.0

197
00:56:24.639 --> 00:56:29.659
question, I'm always willing to answer these anyway. So the message this morning, we're continuing

NOTE confidence=1.0

198
00:56:29.669 --> 00:56:37.719
that worthy series uh that we started um a few weeks ago and I went back to the dictionary about the

NOTE confidence=1.0

199
00:56:37.729 --> 00:56:45.270
definition of being worthy. Uh And I read it to you two definition. Uh And, and don't worry, I'm not

NOTE confidence=1.0

200
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.899
going to do like some kind of francophone or anglophone definition etymology of the word. It's not

NOTE confidence=1.0

201
00:56:50.909 --> 00:56:57.590
about that. It's just like trying to ground ourselves or root ourselves into what being worthy means.

NOTE confidence=1.0

202
00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:07.070
And in the dictionary worthy is described as this deserving respect, admiration or support or

NOTE confidence=1.0

203
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:15.429
another definition is having or showing the qualities or abilities that merit recognition in a

NOTE confidence=1.0

204
00:57:15.439 --> 00:57:29.449
specific way. So worthy by definition is rooted in, I needed to merit something. It's rooted in the

NOTE confidence=1.0

205
00:57:29.459 --> 00:57:38.879
fact that we need to be, we need to deserve to be worthy we merit or we deserve to be worthy. We're

NOTE confidence=1.0

206
00:57:38.889 --> 00:57:46.340
not by default worthy if we're according to the, the dictionary definition and it makes a lot of

NOTE confidence=1.0

207
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:55.270
sense. OK? Because like for instance, and really just going uh uh extremely practical. Uh we want to

NOTE confidence=1.0

208
00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:01.540
have like, if not, even if we're not craving for attention or worthiness, we still want people to

NOTE confidence=1.0

209
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:09.669
see ourselves to uh like not the best angle but not the worst neither. OK. So we want to have like

NOTE confidence=1.0

210
00:58:09.679 --> 00:58:15.520
some kind of a good impression in the way we're living. And if you're not believing me, look at any

NOTE confidence=1.0

211
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:22.489
social media and you'll see that what is mainstream is that we want to look at our best in the image

NOTE confidence=1.0

212
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:28.330
that we're projecting. And I'll be really specific talking about me. It's pretty rare that I

NOTE confidence=1.0

213
00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:34.729
introduce myself to someone new by saying, hey, my name is Joan. When I was in primary school, I

NOTE confidence=1.0

214
00:58:34.739 --> 00:58:42.469
hurt a little boy and accidentally broke his arm, uh, as a teenager, uh, in high school, I stolen a

NOTE confidence=1.0

215
00:58:42.479 --> 00:58:52.330
cookie and I was using piracy music, uh, from Napster. So, what's your, yeah, nice to meet you.

NOTE confidence=1.0

216
00:58:52.340 --> 00:59:01.179
Exactly. So, so what's your name? And, and, and then you, you see that even like talking about

NOTE confidence=1.0

217
00:59:01.189 --> 00:59:09.100
worthiness where we're saying that we want to deserve our merit, some kind of worthy level in the

NOTE confidence=1.0

218
00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:15.780
eyes of the people that we're talking. Uh we, we're even if we're not like a who are addict to that

NOTE confidence=1.0

219
00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:20.629
in the way we present ourselves in the way we're doing lives. We're really trying to position

NOTE confidence=1.0

220
00:59:20.639 --> 00:59:27.699
ourselves to be worthy of something worthy of the attention of people all around us. Um So that's uh

NOTE confidence=1.0

221
00:59:27.709 --> 00:59:35.620
in terms of kind of a really practical example of what, how we're still influenced by and we want to

NOTE confidence=1.0

222
00:59:35.629 --> 00:59:43.179
be worthy and to merit and to deserve some kind of worthiness in our lives. So let's go to the

NOTE confidence=1.0

223
00:59:43.189 --> 00:59:49.810
biblical component of worthiness. So that concept is really the general concept, but what it means

NOTE confidence=1.0

224
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:57.570
to be worthy according to God's perspective. So that's uh the topic that I want to uh explore with

NOTE confidence=1.0

225
00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:02.729
you this morning. Does it make sense? Do you have any interest in that? Yeah, perfect. Always good

NOTE confidence=1.0

226
01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:05.969
because there's no p plan as always. So,

NOTE confidence=1.0

227
01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:14.899
so to, to, to illustrate that and to be able to understand and grasp that a little bit more fully,

NOTE confidence=1.0

228
01:00:14.909 --> 01:00:21.429
what worthiness means in the eyes of God in the eyes of the scripture. I wanted to use a parable,

NOTE confidence=1.0

229
01:00:21.439 --> 01:00:29.810
the parable of the last son, the prodigal son or as we will call it today of the running father. OK.

NOTE confidence=1.0

230
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:37.810
So we'll look at that parable right now. So if you want to put the first verse on the screen, please,

NOTE confidence=1.0

231
01:00:40.129 --> 01:00:48.699
so, and, and, and just a quick context as I was talking about earlier, the Pharisees and the doctor

NOTE confidence=1.0

232
01:00:48.709 --> 01:00:55.979
of the law were intering Jesus because um they were having a big problem with the fact that he was

NOTE confidence=1.0

233
01:00:55.989 --> 01:01:02.850
hanging out with sinners. That's really was their major concern. So Jesus add two parables to

NOTE confidence=1.0

234
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:08.469
explain that they need to consider things in a different way because the way that they were

NOTE confidence=1.0

235
01:01:08.479 --> 01:01:13.719
considering things that you have people that are in the circle, the, the, the people that are

NOTE confidence=1.0

236
01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:19.709
following the laws, tho those are belonging to gods and those who are not following the scripture,

NOTE confidence=1.0

237
01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:25.959
they're obviously not belonging to that inner circle. Therefore, they're exterior to that and

NOTE confidence=1.0

238
01:01:25.969 --> 01:01:34.229
therefore you're not belonging to God and you're not worthy of attention neither. But Jesus was

NOTE confidence=1.0

239
01:01:34.239 --> 01:01:39.350
flipping that upside down and saying no, I wanna hang out with people with people that are sick with

NOTE confidence=1.0

240
01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.979
people that need a doctor, that people that need s that's the reason why II I, I'm on earth, but it

NOTE confidence=1.0

241
01:01:45.989 --> 01:01:54.409
was a little bit hard for them to grasp. So he uh he uh he used a parable to illustrate his point.

NOTE confidence=1.0

242
01:01:54.989 --> 01:02:01.689
So there was a man who had two sons. Uh and, and you know what I like to name people. So I talked

NOTE confidence=1.0

243
01:02:01.699 --> 01:02:08.790
for the, the, the uh example this morning, the youngest son will call it Bobby. I want, I haven't

NOTE confidence=1.0

244
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:16.969
called it Bob because of you Bob. But uh so let's call him Bobby and Ricky the uh oldest son. OK. So,

NOTE confidence=1.0

245
01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:24.189
so the younger Bobby said to his father, father give me my share of the estate. So we divided this

NOTE confidence=1.0

246
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:30.870
property between them. Not long after that, Bobby, Bobby got together all he had set up for a

NOTE confidence=1.0

247
01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:37.889
distant country and then squandered his wealth in wild living. A a and when we're leading that

NOTE confidence=1.0

248
01:02:37.899 --> 01:02:43.149
scriptures, I know you all probably used to with that, with that story in the Bible. But one of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

249
01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:49.540
thing that I really wanted to put some emphasis in right now is that, you know, when Bobby is asking

NOTE confidence=1.0

250
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:58.189
his father to give his part of the estate, what Bobby is saying in uh let's say current language,

NOTE confidence=1.0

251
01:02:58.199 --> 01:03:04.280
Quebecer language is saying it could have been translated something like old fart. I wish you were

NOTE confidence=1.0

252
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:10.860
dad give me the money that belongs to you, but that will, that it will have sooner or later. That's

NOTE confidence=1.0

253
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:16.419
basically what he was saying. And I know I'm a little bit rude in, in what I'm saying. But that's if

NOTE confidence=1.0

254
01:03:16.429 --> 01:03:23.260
you think about the tradition, the Jewish culture at that moment asking that having that ask, that

NOTE confidence=1.0

255
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:30.919
was exactly what he was doing. He wasn't insulting his father in the we was asking he was doing that

NOTE confidence=1.0

256
01:03:30.929 --> 01:03:37.760
asking was not bold. It was outrageous. This is it, it was, it was mean. And he said that himself,

NOTE confidence=1.0

257
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:44.560
Bobby later in his life said sorry, I've sinned against you. Ok? He, he, he acknowledge, see I have

NOTE confidence=1.0

258
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:50.139
sinned. There's, there was something bad, this is really bad. What is happening here? So that's

NOTE confidence=1.0

259
01:03:50.149 --> 01:03:57.820
really something that we sometimes miss when we're reading that little verse here to know how bad

NOTE confidence=1.0

260
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:06.780
Bobby hurt his father. That's really what is happening here. But look at the, so that's about Bobby.

NOTE confidence=1.0

261
01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:13.719
But the father in in this story, look at all he reacting first. If I was the father in that story, I

NOTE confidence=1.0

262
01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:20.820
would say to my, my son who's not called Bobby. But Noah, I always said, I will say wait until I'm

NOTE confidence=1.0

263
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:24.850
died. If there's anything, remain and joy, OK.

NOTE confidence=1.0

264
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:33.080
That's what would I would I would say to him? Not necessarily as the father here. OK? And you don't

NOTE confidence=1.0

265
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:39.770
wanna be in communion and live with me and you wanna break the bridge. Then let's do so. But you do

NOTE confidence=1.0

266
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:46.000
it on your own with all your all means with all your things. But that's not what the father is doing

NOTE confidence=1.0

267
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:52.489
in that story. It complies to the request and this is really heavy in terms of consequence because

NOTE confidence=1.0

268
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:58.659
you can imagine that to have some kind of an estate, they have lands. So we had to, to split some

NOTE confidence=1.0

269
01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:05.389
lands, sell the lands and then it, and it was a lot and two boys. So because it was not the oldest

NOTE confidence=1.0

270
01:05:05.399 --> 01:05:13.120
one, Bobby was the youngest, it was one third of the family fortune. So just give it to him, they'll

NOTE confidence=1.0

271
01:05:13.129 --> 01:05:20.209
sell the estate of the family, give that. And then Bobby monetized that. So, so he goes to uh uh

NOTE confidence=1.0

272
01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:26.610
Shuaa Seo the magazine uh from an episode, the uh the magazine where you can trade everything, a bag,

NOTE confidence=1.0

273
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:33.679
huh? Pawn shop. Exactly. Pawn shop and then trade everything that he had his part and then make sure

NOTE confidence=1.0

274
01:05:33.689 --> 01:05:41.379
that he adds that in cash. So that's, that's the reality about those two, that story right now. But

NOTE confidence=1.0

275
01:05:41.469 --> 01:05:52.260
what is important to mention about this is that one tragedy of our life could be that we obtain what

NOTE confidence=1.0

276
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:59.389
we wish for. So what happened to Bobby right now is that he wanted to have the estate of the father,

NOTE confidence=1.0

277
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:07.989
having the money and do his will for his life and go with that. Ok. And he obtained everything to

NOTE confidence=1.0

278
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.350
the leather and we know the end of the story. He, he, he, he ends up in a bad situation, but that's

NOTE confidence=1.0

279
01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:20.739
something that's worth to be thinking about in our lives. So what are we pursuing in our day to day

NOTE confidence=1.0

280
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:28.530
life? Ok. And what the intent behind that because, and I don't want you to be worried about that to,

NOTE confidence=1.0

281
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:35.500
to, uh, to uh an anxious level. I think it's really quite easy to avoid the situation that Bobby was

NOTE confidence=1.0

282
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:44.199
in. If your mindset is to please God, and if the life that you have, you want to surrender it to

NOTE confidence=1.0

283
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:52.090
God's will, ok? Even if you're in action and you're taking decision and walking in your life, God

NOTE confidence=1.0

284
01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:59.860
will redirect your course according to what is needed because that's really the, the intent of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

285
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:06.770
relationship. However, if you wanna step out of God's will for your life and you wanna administer

NOTE confidence=1.0

286
01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:14.570
your life the way you want, obviously, like it happens to Bobby here, everything will be, you will

NOTE confidence=1.0

287
01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:20.570
be free and we have the full liberty to we to live the life the way we want and intended to be. So

NOTE confidence=1.0

288
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:27.750
if we wanna avoid that situation of Bobby, and you see that in plenty of uh example for men and

NOTE confidence=1.0

289
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:35.449
women in the scripture of people that really deeply wanted to follow God's will put their, put their

NOTE confidence=1.0

290
01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:41.620
life in action and along the, the life and the action that they are taking. Jesus is giving them

NOTE confidence=1.0

291
01:07:41.629 --> 01:07:48.469
advice to correct the course of their life. As long as the intent is to stay on God's purpose for a

NOTE confidence=1.0

292
01:07:48.479 --> 01:07:54.969
life. But that wasn't what Bobby wanted. Bobby wanted to live his life according to his will, his

NOTE confidence=1.0

293
01:07:54.979 --> 01:08:01.860
intent. And you know what God is a gentleman. He leave us live the life that we choose to live and,

NOTE confidence=1.0

294
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:09.739
and that's really something that he will never force on us. So then we're, uh, reading a little bit

NOTE confidence=1.0

295
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:10.310
further

NOTE confidence=1.0

296
01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:19.439
next first. Yeah. So after we had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country

NOTE confidence=1.0

297
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:25.609
and he began to be in need. So we went and hired, uh, and hired himself out to a citizen of that

NOTE confidence=1.0

298
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:32.750
country who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that

NOTE confidence=1.0

299
01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:40.950
the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. So just quickly to mention that Jewish and pigs,

NOTE confidence=1.0

300
01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:49.410
that's not a super association. Ok? They, they were as distant as uh or as mixed as oil and water

NOTE confidence=1.0

301
01:08:49.419 --> 01:08:56.810
could be mixed. So, but then it was even worse because it was to a point where he would desire, he

NOTE confidence=1.0

302
01:08:56.819 --> 01:09:04.839
was so hungry that he would be, he would desire to have the same uh to eat, to eat the same thing as

NOTE confidence=1.0

303
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:11.640
the pig wa was eating. So he's really at the rock bottom in his life in that situation. So let's

NOTE confidence=1.0

304
01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:19.128
continue with the next verse. So when he came to his senses or in other version, it, it it is

NOTE confidence=1.0

305
01:09:19.139 --> 01:09:25.688
mentioned that he, he came back to himself. So, so, so at some moment in our own life, we're really

NOTE confidence=1.0

306
01:09:25.699 --> 01:09:32.019
li living uh a and, and we're putting it and it's, and it's obvious we have a lot of external,

NOTE confidence=1.0

307
01:09:32.028 --> 01:09:40.443
external inter relationship, external work to do. But sometimes for at our inner world. And at that

NOTE confidence=1.0

308
01:09:40.454 --> 01:09:48.583
moment, uh Bobby is looking at his inner world and he said to himself, how many of my father's hired

NOTE confidence=1.0

309
01:09:48.594 --> 01:09:55.023
servants have food to spare. And here I'm starving to death. I will set out and go back to my father

NOTE confidence=1.0

310
01:09:55.034 --> 01:10:02.063
and say to him, father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. As I mentioned earlier, I am

NOTE confidence=1.0

311
01:10:02.074 --> 01:10:10.299
no longer worthy to be called your son. And in that series where we're talking about the worthy and

NOTE confidence=1.0

312
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:17.580
here what we're seeing and it's really totally aligned with the definition of the, the the

NOTE confidence=1.0

313
01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:26.720
dictionary in terms of, can he earn the title of being a son in that in these circumstances?

NOTE confidence=1.0

314
01:10:26.729 --> 01:10:35.319
Obviously, no, he's been like a bad son. He, he, he, he, in fact, he choose to, to step out of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

315
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:41.649
fa of his father household and really live his life. So at that moment, he's saying to himself, I'm

NOTE confidence=1.0

316
01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:48.680
no longer worthy to be called your son. I'm not deserving. I do not merit that. And that's the

NOTE confidence=1.0

317
01:10:48.689 --> 01:10:54.189
obvious reasoning and, and correct reasoning. But we'll see uh a little bit later how things unfold.

NOTE confidence=1.0

318
01:10:54.790 --> 01:11:00.810
So make me like one of your hired servant. I can't be any uh I can't be your son anymore. So I just

NOTE confidence=1.0

319
01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:07.899
wanna be your employee. So he got up and went to his father So, you know what I really like in that,

NOTE confidence=1.0

320
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:15.979
in these verses is the association between verse 17 and verse 20. So when we go in our inner world,

NOTE confidence=1.0

321
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:23.060
we're thinking sometimes in prayer, we're looking at our life and in terms of impact in us and what

NOTE confidence=1.0

322
01:11:23.069 --> 01:11:29.319
is happening inside of us. And sometimes we are doing, we're, we're having some conclusion and, and,

NOTE confidence=1.0

323
01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:35.620
and when we're praying also in this situation, we arrive to a certain knowledge about course

NOTE confidence=1.0

324
01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:41.930
correction that needs to happen in our life. But sometimes he just stays there. Nothing else

NOTE confidence=1.0

325
01:11:41.939 --> 01:11:48.770
continue. But here what is happening is that he went into his inner world. He, he, he, he, he, he

NOTE confidence=1.0

326
01:11:48.779 --> 01:11:55.890
has been enlighten with what needs to be done and then he's doing something he got up. But sometimes

NOTE confidence=1.0

327
01:11:55.899 --> 01:12:02.959
you can be on that inner reflection for years, years, months, months, month after month, we, we know

NOTE confidence=1.0

328
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:09.560
what we need to do, but we never got up and do something. But now Bobby is doing something. He, he

NOTE confidence=1.0

329
01:12:09.569 --> 01:12:13.520
is taking the next step in his life. So let's look at the other verse.

NOTE confidence=1.0

330
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:26.649
But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him. He

NOTE confidence=1.0

331
01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.490
ran to his son.

NOTE confidence=1.0

332
01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:37.229
So, and, and this is really important, the running father. That's where it, it, it, that's the

NOTE confidence=1.0

333
01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:44.379
source of the title of that, that Parable. He ran to his son and I'll just pause here for a minute

NOTE confidence=1.0

334
01:12:44.839 --> 01:12:53.729
running in that time was not a good thing for elderly people or adult people. It was for the child.

NOTE confidence=1.0

335
01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:59.830
Ok. Running was not a good thing because they were adding a rope. Ok. And they would have need to

NOTE confidence=1.0

336
01:12:59.839 --> 01:13:08.529
itch it up. Cesar, itch it up. Yeah. Yeah. Or pull over the rope to be able but no, ok to, to run.

NOTE confidence=1.0

337
01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:17.689
So it will need to pull over, but this will be very humiliating. OK? In that culture to show your

NOTE confidence=1.0

338
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:25.939
bare legs, OK? It will be the equivalent to running in the streets in your uh in your household with

NOTE confidence=1.0

339
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:32.779
your Speedo or boxer. OK? While everyone is sipping and taking their cafe uh taking a sip of coffee.

NOTE confidence=1.0

340
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:39.560
So yeah, you, you got the image young guys. OK. So do the father care about his bare legs. But

NOTE confidence=1.0

341
01:13:39.569 --> 01:13:44.399
that's a lesson for today as well, Anton because now it's gonna be the hot season and we have all

NOTE confidence=1.0

342
01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:50.319
our white legs. We may need to catch them, hide them. So let's consider that as a side note of this

NOTE confidence=1.0

343
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:57.140
message this morning, but that's not the point. But seriously, what I'm talking about is that the

NOTE confidence=1.0

344
01:13:57.149 --> 01:14:07.540
father didn't care. OK? He just run to his son. OK? The minute he saw him and, and, and, and, and,

NOTE confidence=1.0

345
01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:12.370
and you realize also the posture of the son. He, he's coming back home, he's coming back to the

NOTE confidence=1.0

346
01:14:12.379 --> 01:14:21.359
father and the minute he's seeing that is just running to Him, no matter what, the humiliation, no

NOTE confidence=1.0

347
01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:27.810
matter what people could talk about that, no, no importance just running to him. And it says a lot

NOTE confidence=1.0

348
01:14:27.819 --> 01:14:36.450
about the heart of God, there will be nothing that will stop God from running to us. So in any

NOTE confidence=1.0

349
01:14:36.459 --> 01:14:41.859
situation in our life, no matter where we are, no matter what we are living, there will be no

NOTE confidence=1.0

350
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:51.620
situation that will stop God running to us. That's the heart of the father. The other thing that we

NOTE confidence=1.0

351
01:14:51.629 --> 01:15:00.580
need to realize as well is that you remember Bobby is the son who just squandered a third of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

352
01:15:00.589 --> 01:15:09.180
family estate. Ok? Is that guy is coming with no penny and just like nothing, nothing coming back

NOTE confidence=1.0

353
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:18.819
home. A third of the family estate has been wasted. And then that's the same Bobby who insulted his

NOTE confidence=1.0

354
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:26.430
father saying you wish you were, I wish you were dead and then coming back to that guy really alive

NOTE confidence=1.0

355
01:15:26.799 --> 01:15:37.129
and really expecting him to at least embracing him or taking consi considering him as an employee.

NOTE confidence=1.0

356
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:44.770
That's the position of Bobby when he's coming there. But what's the, the behavior of the father

NOTE confidence=1.0

357
01:15:44.779 --> 01:15:52.450
tells a lot about the the the heart of God in their circumstances. There will be no amount of insult,

NOTE confidence=1.0

358
01:15:52.459 --> 01:16:04.850
no amount uh of mistakes that will ever stop God considering us a worthy son and a worthy daughter.

NOTE confidence=1.0

359
01:16:05.479 --> 01:16:19.390
So nothing that he has done could make him make God thinks less of him is still his son. And that's

NOTE confidence=1.0

360
01:16:19.399 --> 01:16:25.549
the same for us in our lives as well. And sometimes the, uh I, I think discussion also, uh through

NOTE confidence=1.0

361
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:31.970
the years with, you know, there's the, the sin against the Holy Spirit when you said something uh to

NOTE confidence=1.0

362
01:16:31.979 --> 01:16:39.290
God and that this is some kind of uh of a sin that is unforgivable. And it's a really kind of tough

NOTE confidence=1.0

363
01:16:39.299 --> 01:16:45.540
passage. Eventually, we could talk a little bit more about that. But, but the thing behind that

NOTE confidence=1.0

364
01:16:45.549 --> 01:16:54.220
passage will never, will never override this here. When we, even if at some point in your life,

NOTE confidence=1.0

365
01:16:54.290 --> 01:17:01.060
you're mad at God and you're insulting him and there's things that going out of your mouth or even

NOTE confidence=1.0

366
01:17:01.069 --> 01:17:08.220
like stepping out of God's will for your life, it doesn't care. He will still run to you. He will

NOTE confidence=1.0

367
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:17.325
still conti consider you as a worthy son and father. And that worth is not based on the merits or if

NOTE confidence=1.0

368
01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:25.745
you deserve it or not, it's purely based on the goodness of God. That's really the flip, the uh the,

NOTE confidence=1.0

369
01:17:25.754 --> 01:17:32.035
the, the flip uh side of what we're finding in the dictionary, the dictionary, you already mentioned

NOTE confidence=1.0

370
01:17:32.044 --> 01:17:39.984
that we need to merit or to deserve to be worthy, but to be worthy to be a son of God, to be a son

NOTE confidence=1.0

371
01:17:39.995 --> 01:17:47.229
of God or a daughter of God, there's nothing that needs to be done. And even if we're doing, uh if

NOTE confidence=1.0

372
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.910
we were uh herring in our life in the wrong direction that never will change the fact that if we

NOTE confidence=1.0

373
01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:59.939
want to go home, we'll come back to the father, we will always be considered a worthy son and other.

NOTE confidence=1.0

374
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.930
So that's, we're, we're coming to the last

NOTE confidence=1.0

375
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:16.549
part of that parable in the next verse verse 22. But the father said to his servants quick, bring

NOTE confidence=1.0

376
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:23.359
the best robe and put it on him, put a ring on his finger and send all on his feet. Bring uh sandal

NOTE confidence=1.0

377
01:18:23.479 --> 01:18:28.100
on his feet. When you have no sandals, you're a slave. When you have sandals, you're uh you're,

NOTE confidence=1.0

378
01:18:28.109 --> 01:18:34.979
you're, you're a free man. So bring the fat and calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate

NOTE confidence=1.0

379
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:41.870
for this. So let's have a feast and celebrate earlier. We start, we talked about the communion that

NOTE confidence=1.0

380
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:51.879
desire for feasting, having intimate relationship with us. This is coming back again in that verse.

NOTE confidence=1.0

381
01:18:52.379 --> 01:18:57.770
That's a wonderful news. What we need to do when there's a wonderful news. Let's have a feast and

NOTE confidence=1.0

382
01:18:57.779 --> 01:19:03.169
celebrate another party, throwing party, always party, party, party. So let's have a feast and

NOTE confidence=1.0

383
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:09.899
celebrate. There's a wonderful event that is happening. My son that was dead is now alive. So for

NOTE confidence=1.0

384
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:17.910
this son of mine was dead and he is alive again, he was lost and is fine, found it. So they began to

NOTE confidence=1.0

385
01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:25.979
celebrate. Now comes Ricky in the story. So next verse, Ricky is there me meanwhile, Ricky was in

NOTE confidence=1.0

386
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:33.959
the field when he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So you can imagine based for the

NOTE confidence=1.0

387
01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:42.649
music by boom, boom, boom. Look what's happening, man. Throwing a party without me. Surprise, Ricky,

NOTE confidence=1.0

388
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:49.339
you don't know why they're throwing a party. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was

NOTE confidence=1.0

389
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:55.080
going on. So he said your brother has come. He replied, and your father has killed the fat and calf

NOTE confidence=1.0

390
01:19:55.089 --> 01:20:02.259
because he has him back safe and sound so fat and calf need to be replaced by Costco. Ok? So he went

NOTE confidence=1.0

391
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:10.529
to Costco and grab everything big format and throw a big party. Ok? So because he has sent back and

NOTE confidence=1.0

392
01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:16.750
safe and some the older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and

NOTE confidence=1.0

393
01:20:16.759 --> 01:20:24.509
pleaded with him. And that's really an interesting part here. Look at the difference between Ricky

NOTE confidence=1.0

394
01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:33.660
and the father. The father has been running to meet Bobby. Ricky is standing on the porch of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

395
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:43.520
door and waiting there and refused to enter, refused to welcome his um his uh his, his brother, his

NOTE confidence=1.0

396
01:20:43.529 --> 01:20:49.390
youngest brother, he refuses that just won. So look at that and that's really important because

NOTE confidence=1.0

397
01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:58.640
we're called to emulate the father's behavior, not Ricky's behavior. So next verse, the father,

NOTE confidence=1.0

398
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:07.799
I started to plead with him. Look, uh the, the, the not the father, but uh Ricky is saying, look all

NOTE confidence=1.0

399
01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:17.609
these years, I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yes. Slaving. Slaving. Yeah.

NOTE confidence=1.0

400
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:26.180
And in this word slaving for you, obeying all the orders basically remind we need to remind

NOTE confidence=1.0

401
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:33.020
ourselves that the context of that parable is really echoing to the Pharisees and the doctor of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

402
01:21:33.029 --> 01:21:41.709
law saying that they were not perfect but they were doing following every order of Jesus, doing all

NOTE confidence=1.0

403
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:47.839
the acts that needs to be done. That's the reason why they're using the word slaving for you. But

NOTE confidence=1.0

404
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:54.310
you know all the the, the rea the relationship has been distorted by the f the doctor of the law and

NOTE confidence=1.0

405
01:21:54.319 --> 01:22:01.350
by Ricky. So Ricky is not enjoying the presence of the father. He's like kind of following different

NOTE confidence=1.0

406
01:22:01.359 --> 01:22:11.720
orders. And then also by doing so being in an attitude where he deserves so much. So. But when this

NOTE confidence=1.0

407
01:22:11.729 --> 01:22:18.189
son of yours was squandered your property and said, he said, yes, you never even me given me a young

NOTE confidence=1.0

408
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:24.200
girl. So II I could celebrate with my friends. But when the son of yours, son of yours, not Bobby,

NOTE confidence=1.0

409
01:22:24.209 --> 01:22:30.979
my brother, OK, the son of yours. OK. So it could be, it could have been more insulting. But that

NOTE confidence=1.0

410
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:38.660
was, it gives an idea about uh Ricky mindset. That son of yours who has squandered your property

NOTE confidence=1.0

411
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:47.279
with prostitutes comes home and killed a fat cow for him. And then the father said, my son, you are

NOTE confidence=1.0

412
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:55.890
always with me and everything I have is yours. It couldn't be not, it couldn't be truer because a

NOTE confidence=1.0

413
01:22:55.899 --> 01:23:04.229
third has been given. So the last two thirds belongs to the oldest. Uh but we have to celebrate and

NOTE confidence=1.0

414
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:14.750
be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again and he was lost and now his phone.

NOTE confidence=1.0

415
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:25.709
So let's be really practical about that as well. So one thing we learned in that part of the parable

NOTE confidence=1.0

416
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.930
or, or just, we've been reminded, not necessarily learned, but we've been reminded that no matter

NOTE confidence=1.0

417
01:23:31.939 --> 01:23:42.529
where we are in our lives, nothing can separate us and nothing can uh decrease the value that we

NOTE confidence=1.0

418
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:51.160
have in the eyes of God. We're still a worthy to be called a son and daughter of God. That's the

NOTE confidence=1.0

419
01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:59.129
first part of that parable. But in that second part, what we are also learning or being reminded

NOTE confidence=1.0

420
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:07.919
about is that being a community of Christian follower when there's people that are coming in that

NOTE confidence=1.0

421
01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:16.049
community after doing the same thing that Bobby has done in his life. OK. The way we are gonna

NOTE confidence=1.0

422
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:27.609
welcome these people will impact their lives and will also uh create um will set the tone for the

NOTE confidence=1.0

423
01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:35.089
rest of the relationship with them. We don't wanna be ending like Pharisees or laws doctor where

NOTE confidence=1.0

424
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:42.240
there was some kind of certain standards to reach to be able to be part of a community to belongs to

NOTE confidence=1.0

425
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:48.649
a community of believer that's never been the intent of what God's wanted to create it. The intent

NOTE confidence=1.0

426
01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:55.850
of what God wanted to be CRE to want to be creating is a community of son and daughter that are

NOTE confidence=1.0

427
01:24:55.859 --> 01:25:04.669
obeying to the father that the father is discipling our ourselves. He's taking care of our progress

NOTE confidence=1.0

428
01:25:05.049 --> 01:25:14.279
and we are to celebrate people that are journeying in that process. And, and sometimes, and you've

NOTE confidence=1.0

429
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:19.799
probably lived that in your Christian life. And, and even if we're talking, thinking about church

NOTE confidence=1.0

430
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:29.439
story here in Quebec, that's not necessarily the place where you think you need to go a church when

NOTE confidence=1.0

431
01:25:29.549 --> 01:25:38.350
you screwed your life or when you no longer consider yourself worthy or merit any worthiness. And

NOTE confidence=1.0

432
01:25:38.359 --> 01:25:44.089
that's maybe something that in your mind, we're saying that the church is not necessarily for me,

NOTE confidence=1.0

433
01:25:44.359 --> 01:25:50.609
but it's the exact opposite. And what is beautiful about the community here of River in River's edge.

NOTE confidence=1.0

434
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:56.439
And I know that's, that's the same thing also in other churches. But we need to be always careful

NOTE confidence=1.0

435
01:25:56.770 --> 01:26:04.270
about how do we welcome people that were lost that are finally found? How do we make sure that we

NOTE confidence=1.0

436
01:26:04.279 --> 01:26:09.790
feel them welcome? And how do we make sure that we journey together with them? And that

NOTE confidence=1.0

437
01:26:09.799 --> 01:26:18.009
responsibility is a shared responsibility by all of us because the idea behind that is really to be

NOTE confidence=1.0

438
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:24.910
the disciple that Jesus and the community that Jesus wanted us to be. So that's the challenge when

NOTE confidence=1.0

439
01:26:24.919 --> 01:26:31.569
we're looking at that second part of that story here, when you're looking at Ricky, would we be the

NOTE confidence=1.0

440
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:38.299
Ricky that will be, wait and see until people change their life or will reach a certain potential or

NOTE confidence=1.0

441
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:45.399
will, or will believe in certain things or will we be like the father running to welcome people that

NOTE confidence=1.0

442
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:55.000
were lost and that are finally found? And this is the responsibility that we all share together. So

NOTE confidence=1.0

443
01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:56.490
I'll finish with one thing

NOTE confidence=1.0

444
01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:08.910
about, uh, that, that Powerball uh the the topic of, of worthiness. And I'm really happy that we've

NOTE confidence=1.0

445
01:27:08.919 --> 01:27:16.120
been able to explore that for, for, for so many weeks. But the topic of worthiness is more relevant

NOTE confidence=1.0

446
01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:26.379
than ever. I think in today's world and today's tension because there's so many publicity and, and

NOTE confidence=1.0

447
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:34.169
images that surrounds us in terms of what could model our life. In terms of example, people we

NOTE confidence=1.0

448
01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:41.720
should be behavior we should have and all these kind of elements that puts ourselves in a comparison

NOTE confidence=1.0

449
01:27:41.729 --> 01:27:50.930
state. OK. And, and, and think about photo uh pictures, examples that the in terms of singers, movie,

NOTE confidence=1.0

450
01:27:50.939 --> 01:27:58.129
whatever we're constantly influence. And because of the technology, we're, we're, we're even more

NOTE confidence=1.0

451
01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:05.740
sensitive to that because it's just surrounding us like uh seven days, 24 hours a day. That's not

NOTE confidence=1.0

452
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:12.540
necessarily a problem to that extent, to, to, to that point, the only point where things are being,

NOTE confidence=1.0

453
01:28:12.549 --> 01:28:20.009
being dangerous is when we're starting to compare ourselves. And by doing that comparison, doubting

NOTE confidence=1.0

454
01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:24.620
our self worth. And, and and starting to um

NOTE confidence=1.0

455
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:36.399
doubt the fact that we are a beloved son and daughter and that we belonging to God, the exact same

NOTE confidence=1.0

456
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:42.799
way we are that nothing needs to be changed in terms of who we are. The shape. We have the color of

NOTE confidence=1.0

457
01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:49.250
our eyes, the, the size that we have the personality as well. We need to evolve. Uh Of course,

NOTE confidence=1.0

458
01:28:49.259 --> 01:28:56.970
because that's the journey uh that, that we're in through our life long. But the way we are, no

NOTE confidence=1.0

459
01:28:56.979 --> 01:29:03.189
matter the noise around us, no matter where we are, we, we, we could be in our mind to start

NOTE confidence=1.0

460
01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:10.500
comparing to, to other people and doubting that we're maybe something uh that is worthy of love,

NOTE confidence=1.0

461
01:29:10.509 --> 01:29:15.390
worthy to be called a daughter and a son of God. That's where the problem lies. And that's the

NOTE confidence=1.0

462
01:29:15.399 --> 01:29:25.140
reason why it is so important to remind ourselves that God, if, if we want to be in the home of the

NOTE confidence=1.0

463
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:34.319
father, if we want to embrace God's will in our life, he will run to us. He will, he is already

NOTE confidence=1.0

464
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:44.009
declaring us son and daughter of him. And therefore our value is not based on anything that we need

NOTE confidence=1.0

465
01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:51.589
to merit or deserve. It's just something a pure gift that God is offering us. And that's the value

NOTE confidence=1.0

466
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:59.169
that we have to his eyes. That's really uh the message behind uh that parable and the thing uh that

NOTE confidence=1.0

467
01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:07.209
I would like us to stick in our mind. As well as the one of how do we will are, will we welcome also

NOTE confidence=1.0

468
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:15.479
people that were dead and they are coming to life, that celebration that we can embrace. So I'll ask

NOTE confidence=1.0

469
01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:18.250
you to, to stand. We'll just finish with a word of prayer.

NOTE confidence=1.0

470
01:30:24.879 --> 01:30:31.930
So God, uh I wanna thank you for uh that morning. Um And I want to ask you also Jesus to

NOTE confidence=1.0

471
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:44.540
really to speak to uh all of us this morning, asking your, your Holy Spirit to

NOTE confidence=1.0

472
01:30:46.859 --> 01:30:51.740
imprint in our heart. The incredible value we have

NOTE confidence=1.0

473
01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.839
that we are worthy

NOTE confidence=1.0

474
01:30:58.339 --> 01:30:59.870
no matter what we have done,

NOTE confidence=1.0

475
01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:13.520
no matter what we haven't done. We are of an incredible value for you the way we are and that you're

NOTE confidence=1.0

476
01:31:13.529 --> 01:31:23.200
declaring that in our heart, that we are your sons and the other, a worthy sons and the other

NOTE confidence=1.0

477
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:38.790
God. I also want you to help us to continue being that community that goes and welcome people that

NOTE confidence=1.0

478
01:31:38.799 --> 01:31:46.240
are coming here Sunday after Sunday and that celebrates these lives that are changed Sunday after

NOTE confidence=1.0

479
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:53.660
Sunday and that we could be really emulating your behavior in that parable and running to welcome

NOTE confidence=1.0

480
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:58.879
anybody that is coming here, no matter where they are in their journey, no matter what they have

NOTE confidence=1.0

481
01:31:58.890 --> 01:32:03.879
done in their past. No, no matter what their feelings because we're a community

NOTE confidence=1.0

482
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:14.910
of failures, but that have been called worthy by your love. By the way, you decided to designate us.

NOTE confidence=1.0

483
01:32:15.419 --> 01:32:20.549
And this is the only thing that is important when we're coming in these wall, when we're serving

NOTE confidence=1.0

484
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:29.689
alongside you is that glue that thick us all together. So Jesus, I really want you and your Holy

NOTE confidence=1.0

485
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:36.250
Spirit to print that in our mind this morning, to know that you love us, you know that we are worthy

NOTE confidence=1.0

486
01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:43.089
and that we can feel we can make few people that will come here, that they are welcome. They are

NOTE confidence=1.0

487
01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:51.959
worthy as well in your precious name. We are praying this morning. Amen. Amen. So God bless you.

NOTE confidence=1.0

488
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.470
You,

NOTE confidence=1.0

489
01:43:00.129 --> 01:43:01.640

512
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:33.660
that are happening at River's edge. So this will not take long. We're moving to the giving and we

NOTE confidence=1.0

513
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:39.919
just wanna give you a word of encouragement. So I just um wanna share um when I first became a

NOTE confidence=1.0

514
01:46:39.930 --> 01:46:48.240
Christian, um I had struggle in giving because I being a giver or being generous was not a, you know,

NOTE confidence=1.0

515
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:54.680
natural, was not natural for me. But then I use that as an excuse when it comes to giving my time,

NOTE confidence=1.0

516
01:46:54.689 --> 01:46:59.779
my talent, my money. I often like tell God, oh, I'm not generous giving or for like, you know,

NOTE confidence=1.0

517
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:07.819
giving is for generous people until God actually corrected me and led me to this verse that I'm

NOTE confidence=1.0

518
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:16.529
gonna share. It's Genesis 127. So God created mankind in his own image in the image of God. He

NOTE confidence=1.0

519
01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:23.950
created them male and female. He created them in simple terms. As human beings are created in the

NOTE confidence=1.0

520
01:47:23.959 --> 01:47:30.549
image and likeness of God. He instilled his character in us. And one of God's character is being

NOTE confidence=1.0

521
01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:38.450
generous. God is a giver. How do we know that God is a giver? If you look all of creation, you will

NOTE confidence=1.0

522
01:47:38.459 --> 01:47:49.330
see the evidence of God's um abundant generosity and him, him sending his son Jesus to die for us is

NOTE confidence=1.0

523
01:47:49.339 --> 01:47:57.290
also evidence of his generosity as he sent his son, heaven's best for us. So as our father is a

NOTE confidence=1.0

524
01:47:57.299 --> 01:48:05.975
giver, we are also givers. This is the reason why we give because we are generous people giving is a

NOTE confidence=1.0

525
01:48:05.984 --> 01:48:14.544
natural response to the character that God has put in us. As a matter of fact, us not you know, not

NOTE confidence=1.0

526
01:48:14.555 --> 01:48:21.854
giving our time or our money or whatever it is, is us acting out of character because that's not who

NOTE confidence=1.0

527
01:48:21.865 --> 01:48:30.689
we are. We are generous people, we are created that way. And as generous people, we also co partner

NOTE confidence=1.0

528
01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:38.660
with God in building his kingdom. So here on earth, so that the people who wants to come back home.

NOTE confidence=1.0

529
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:48.149
Um They are able to come back home and also for us believers to have a place of safety. And now if
