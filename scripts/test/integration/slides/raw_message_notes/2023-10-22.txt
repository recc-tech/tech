-Ruled By Kindness For His Son
-Ruled By Kindness For His People
-Ruled By Kindness For Himself 
-When Your Observations Change From Kindness To Jealousy 
-Jealousy Will Turn Your Heart Away From Kindness And Toward Hatred 
-Jealousy Will Make You Believe That God Is For Others More Than He Is For You
-If You Want Someone To Be More Successful
Than Be Jealous Of Them.
-Let Your Life Be Ruled By Kindness
