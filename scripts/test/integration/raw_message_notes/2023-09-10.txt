The Principle Is The Promise

Isaac Was Surrounded To Succeed By Family & Friends
Genesis 24:1-2 NLT
1 Abraham was now a very old man, and the Lord had blessed him in every way. 2 One day Abraham said to his oldest servant, the man in charge of his household, “Take an oath by putting your hand under my thigh. 

The Principle Was Upheld By Those Who Upheld Isaac 
Genesis 24:3 NLT
3 Swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women.

The Principle Didn’t Have To Change But The Location Did
Genesis 24:4 NLT
4 Go instead to my homeland, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son Isaac.”

The Principle Was Upheld To Not Jeopardize The Promise
Genesis 24:4 NLT
7 For the Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and my native land, solemnly promised to give this land to my descendants. He will send his angel ahead of you, and he will see to it that you find a wife there for my son. 
8 If she is unwilling to come back with you, then you are free from this oath of mine. But under no circumstances are you to take my son there.”
