00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:44.260
Hey, everybody just want to welcome you to Rivers Edge You guys. Excited to be here. I know that we

2
00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:53.230
are. And uh as we enter into this season of rest, which we call summer in Montreal, I know that we

3
00:07:53.239 --> 00:08:02.179
can easily maybe make a bad decision. And and let me just say this, I know that you know, when

4
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:08.369
summer comes around, you could make a lot of bad decisions in this city. But I think the one that we

5
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:19.950
really want to avoid is taking a vacation from God. We don't want to rest from the Lord. We need the

6
00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:30.589
Lord to rest. And so even if we're not in this place, we need to still be connected to the God who

7
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.078
creates every space for us to experience His blessing in. And so wherever you go, whatever you do

8
00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:44.098
remember to bring God with you because he already wants to be with you and he has promised to be

9
00:08:44.109 --> 00:08:52.820
with you. So the question is, are you gonna be a blessing the way that God wants you to be? And part

10
00:08:52.830 --> 00:09:01.169
of just seeing that blessing increase in our lives and seeing that blessing outflow from our lives

11
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:09.770
is by being in community. And so today, I want to encourage you to worship with us as we continue

12
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:18.530
our journey of love of faith and of hope is a place where you belong even before you believe. But

13
00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:26.140
it's a place where God encourages us to believe like never before. And we can do that best when we

14
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:33.039
follow Jesus. And we want to introduce you to Him in a new and profound way that maybe you haven't

15
00:09:33.049 --> 00:09:39.460
considered before. And I believe that God has a way of revealing himself in new ways to us every

16
00:09:39.469 --> 00:09:46.659
time that we open our minds and our hearts and our lives to him. So even if you have known Jesus for

17
00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:53.359
a long time, know that today, you're going to have a new encounter with Him because that's what God

18
00:09:53.369 --> 00:10:01.320
is always wanting to do is to reveal more of himself to each of us. Are you ready for that today? So

19
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:07.700
let's do that. Would you stand with me as we would just open in a word of prayer? And we wanna ask

20
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:15.739
that God would bless this gathering, bless this time of worship, bless our time where we can grow in

21
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:21.919
your word and be challenged and motivated and grown spiritually through it. I pray father that today

22
00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:29.390
would be that new day for each of us. Thank you for inspiring us for teaching us for correcting us.

23
00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:35.950
Thank you that this is an opportunity for us to confess to you an opportunity to ask for your

24
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:42.700
forgiveness and to receive it so that we can be free from the things of this past so that we can

25
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:49.729
explore and experience the incredible things you have for us in the future. Thank you for that. Lord.

26
00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:56.340
We pray these things in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Let's worship together. Let's enjoy this time

27
00:10:56.349 --> 00:11:00.940
together, but more importantly, let's participate in it. Would you welcome the River's Edge worship

28
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.299
team,

29
00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:09.320
Canada day long. We kind of so glad you guys decided to join in and we are wearing the colors

30
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:15.669
because we are proud that we live in Canada and let us enjoy the freedom that we have in this

31
00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:20.849
country to worship our Lord and savior with all our heart. Let's sing the song, "New Name Written

32
00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:21.760
Down in Glory."

71
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:43.859
Awesome. Well, we've got a great announcement to make with regards to our kids ministry here at

72
00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:50.760
River's Edge. So during the summer while most churches are just ramping down, we are actually

73
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:57.930
ramping up. I know it hasn't been that long since we've been opened and reopened. Uh Imagine that we

74
00:27:57.939 --> 00:28:06.310
actually reopened the first week of August last year. And so it's been a year now and we've been

75
00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:12.260
building back up, putting back all of our ministries and programs and activities. And so while we

76
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:21.150
have been dismissing the kids right after our own worship, what's changing as of next Sunday is that

77
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:28.489
you're gonna sign in your kids at the beginning of the service. So at the very beginning, when you

78
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:35.000
walk in with your kids, you're gonna sign them up, they're gonna go into their classes because we

79
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:41.459
have live kids worship for them starting next Sunday. Isn't that amazing?

80
00:28:46.969 --> 00:28:54.760
And that's an incredible thing because it required us casting vision to our worship team right here

81
00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:00.890
at River's Edge, which every week has been growing and improving and developing and they have

82
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:07.449
decided to go on our rotation to lead worship for the kids. Can we give it up for our worship team

83
00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:08.410
at River's Edge?

84
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:18.569
And so they're gonna be going in leading worship for the kids every Sunday starting this coming

85
00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:26.209
Sunday at 10:30 a.m. So God bless uh for that. And uh the second announcement that I have for you is

86
00:29:26.219 --> 00:29:32.439
with regards to our guys and girls uh barbecue. So guys is the name of our men's ministry at Rivers

87
00:29:32.449 --> 00:29:39.140
Edge and girls is the name of our women's ministry at Rivers Edge. We have pheno phenomenal leaders

88
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:45.089
that we've presented to you. We've prayed over them and they have begun the ministry within this

89
00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:52.060
church but also within this community of faith. And so what's exciting is that on the 15th? So in

90
00:29:52.069 --> 00:30:00.160
just a short while Saturday the 15th, we are going to have a barbecue in the park from 11 a.m. to 3

91
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:06.569
p.m. And we're going to be meeting there at that time. And if you want to help out with the set up,

92
00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:13.329
you want to bring a dish for everyone to share all of those things are wonderful. But we also just

93
00:30:13.339 --> 00:30:20.130
ask you to just bring someone with you and with that, bring your own chair, bring a blanket that you

94
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:26.500
can just sit on, just be comfortable and expect to have a great time and to get to meet the other

95
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:34.160
amazing people in this community of faith since reopening, we've been a steady 150 every single week.

96
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:40.939
It's not the same 150 every week, but God is increasing those numbers. We're trending up in that

97
00:30:40.949 --> 00:30:46.500
regard. So there's so many people that we haven't met yet and what these events do is that they

98
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:53.209
bring us closer in terms of community. There are so many new faces every week that we want to have a

99
00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:58.369
name to go with that beautiful face of yours. And we want to be able to just journey with you

100
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.334
spiritually. And this is great opportunity for you to make some friends meet. Some new people have

101
00:31:03.344 --> 00:31:08.545
some amazing barbecue and we've got like a professional chef that's going to be at the barbecue.

102
00:31:08.594 --> 00:31:14.145
We've got some Brazilians who think the professional chefs that are going to be at the um at the

103
00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:20.160
barbecue. No, honestly, you can't beat the Brazilians with meat. I, I don't know if anybody agrees

104
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:26.160
with that, but I definitely, I, I, I've tasted the difference. I know, um, and I would encourage you

105
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.609
to come out for that and, and so it's, if you want to play volleyball, play, if you don't wanna play,

106
00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:35.900
don't play, it's really up to you, but it's gonna be a great time. Now, in case it rains on the

107
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:43.390
Saturday, what we're doing is that we're gonna do it Sunday the next day after the service. So if it

108
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.640
rains on Saturday, it's canceled. If we don't have a way of reaching you and letting you know it's

109
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:54.849
canceled. Um, and you're not connected to our social platforms, just know it's canceled, then we'll

110
00:31:54.859 --> 00:32:01.369
do it Sunday after the gathering. Is it clear? Ok. I think so. Hopefully. So the other thing we've

111
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:07.869
got for you and if this is something that we do annually, we have an annual general meeting. And

112
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:15.849
what we do is that we have all of our financials audited by an outside firm and then we have a

113
00:32:15.859 --> 00:32:21.939
meeting to just show the community of faith that we're a part of this is what we've done with the

114
00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:27.449
money that you've given us. We also have a budget that we're going to review for this coming year.

115
00:32:27.459 --> 00:32:33.550
Plus you're going to hear about some of the amazing things that have happened in 2022 plus in 2023.

116
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:40.609
And so if you're interested in checking this out, then you can do that just by going to the website,

117
00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:45.469
there's going to be a link which is going to be a Zoom link. And so this annual general meeting is

118
00:32:45.479 --> 00:32:51.500
going to be by Zoom. So you can just log in and just participate, you're going to hear all of these

119
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:56.719
presentations and then if you have any questions, you can ask them in that meeting as well. And so

120
00:32:56.729 --> 00:33:01.229
it's an open thing. You're more than welcome to attend it. That's how we do things here with

121
00:33:01.239 --> 00:33:05.270
transparency. Amen. All right. Next thing

122
00:33:07.449 --> 00:33:12.709
we've got another couple of announcements and the next thing is the giving. And so what's beautiful

123
00:33:12.719 --> 00:33:17.660
about what's happening with technology is that we've got a couple of apps that you can use. So even

124
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:23.790
if you're not here, you can set up your recurring giving, you can make your donation through Tide or

125
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:29.939
through Canada helps and we appreciate that so much. So even even if you're like, you know, just

126
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:37.260
snorkeling in the Maldives in just a few weeks. Wouldn't that be a dream right now? You could just

127
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:43.300
like, hey, log into the app and then give and that's as easy as it would be. And so we know that

128
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.420
you've been supporting this church. That's how we've gotten this far. That's how we made it through

129
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:53.579
the pandemic. That's how we've been able to just reopen and that's how we're continuing to grow each

130
00:33:53.589 --> 00:33:59.619
and every week by reinstating a lot of the things that we had to stop for a few years. And so we're

131
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:04.520
so blessed by that. So thank you for your generosity, can give yourself a round of applause and

132
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:10.959
because I mean, we wouldn't make it without you guys honestly. And so that's where your donations go.

133
00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:16.959
And again, all that is also going to be revealed at the AGM. So the after party is what we call our

134
00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:23.100
time of community at the end of the gathering. And so we've got some, some cold drinks that are set

135
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:29.769
up for you there. And so for this month and most likely part of August as well, and maybe most of

136
00:34:29.779 --> 00:34:34.608
August, we're going to have cold drinks and not hot drinks. And so at the end of the gathering, just

137
00:34:34.618 --> 00:34:40.069
make your way over there, some delicious things have been just made for you so that you can just

138
00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:44.529
enjoy and partake in that. And that's another opportunity for you to connect and get to know other

139
00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:51.289
people here at this church. Well, we're going to transition now to the message. Let's watch this

140
00:34:51.299 --> 00:34:55.309
video as we get started in our series for the summer, which is called Getting there.

141
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:47.300
Hey, we're just gonna take a moment uh real quick to just pray for uh Darren and Cathy. Um Darren

142
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:55.949
Miller has been battling cancer for a while now and he's uh just made the decision himself to um ask

143
00:35:55.959 --> 00:36:02.889
his wife to take him to palliative care. Um And uh we just need to pray uh right now for Darren,

144
00:36:02.899 --> 00:36:08.229
pray for Cathy, that God would be with them. Would you help me to do that? And so father, we want to

145
00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:13.350
pray for this couple and we want to pray for what's going on in their lives at this moment. We know

146
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.280
what this means and we know what this looks like. And we've prayed for healing, we've prayed for,

147
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.129
for you to extend his life. And while you extended his life, God, we see that you have not given Him

148
00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:30.709
the victory and the healing over this cancer. We don't know what your plans are. We don't know what

149
00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:36.080
the future holds for Him, but we do know that you are still with them. And if it's comfort that they

150
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:41.270
need the most right now, would you give that to them? Would you give them the joy the, the

151
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.040
understanding of what it is that you need to do even in this moment for the next steps and give them

152
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:54.159
clarity and an understanding of what needs to happen for them as a family. We pray for them, we pray

153
00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:59.570
for their kids. We pray for their grandkids, we pray for all that they have going on and lord we

154
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:07.620
just pray your blessing over them today. In jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Well, when we talk about

155
00:37:07.629 --> 00:37:13.429
getting there, we're talking about being on a journey. And I think one of the important things that

156
00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:19.399
all of us have recognized is that whenever we have experienced setbacks or obstacles and

157
00:37:19.409 --> 00:37:26.199
circumstances that have possibly interfered in our plans, uh When we have persevered, we've seen how

158
00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:32.709
things can turn around when we don't accept the faith that is given to us. And we don't just accept

159
00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:41.669
it as fate, but we respond with faith instead, we see what God could do. We understand that there

160
00:37:41.679 --> 00:37:48.010
are so many things that can happen that are outside of our control. And I feel like part of

161
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:54.939
understanding faith is recognizing that it's all out of our control for the most part, except the

162
00:37:54.949 --> 00:38:02.979
decisions that we make. And when we ask God for guidance and we ask him for wisdom on this journey,

163
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:11.370
we can make decisions that God helps us to experience the blessings that He has for us in this life.

164
00:38:12.709 --> 00:38:22.750
I don't think God is about talking to us about getting there. He's about us just understanding that

165
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:30.709
He is able to get us there. He's not there to tease us with this concept. He's there to help us to

166
00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:36.199
achieve it. Uh, did you notice how things have been changing in your life or maybe you're still in

167
00:38:36.209 --> 00:38:41.479
your twenties? And, uh, when you're in your twenties, you're pretty much up for anything when

168
00:38:41.489 --> 00:38:46.570
someone calls you up and they say you want to do this, your answer is generally yes, you're just

169
00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.840
going to go for it when you're in your thirties, you start to think about things a little bit more

170
00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:59.840
and you say I'll meet you there and, and the reason you say I'll meet you there is because you may

171
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.840
not show up

172
00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:11.229
or make the decision to leave early. And so you've got that freedom to be able to have an exit

173
00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:15.719
strategy. When you're in your forties, you ask who's going to be there

174
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:26.449
because you've recognized now that there's a lot of people, you just don't like, they annoy you. You

175
00:39:26.459 --> 00:39:34.780
don't want to spend time with them. You realize in your forties how time is of the essence and, and

176
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:41.860
if this is not going to be strategic in one way or another, you do not want to waste more time in

177
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:49.489
your forties. And then when you're in your fifties, you just find excuses and stay home like you

178
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:56.360
just don't go anywhere because you just realize you don't even have the energy to take the step that

179
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:06.110
you need to take to just get dressed and make an effort to interact with other human beings. I don't

180
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.929
know what it looks like for you at the stage of life that you're in. But I do know that we sometimes

181
00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:18.879
need to ask this question, who's coming with me? And, and the people that we do life with are the

182
00:40:18.889 --> 00:40:29.989
people that are key in us, experiencing the blessings that God has in store for us. We want to be

183
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.800
well surrounded. We want people that are going to not only invest in us, but we can invest in them.

184
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:46.550
We want people who are going to lift us up and hold us up and we want to be those kinds of people to

185
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:54.790
the people. We experience that from the question of who's coming with me is, is a question that we

186
00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:02.250
can sometimes ask and, and, and, and at different stages of our life, it holds a different meaning.

187
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:12.010
It has a different answer. I remember in my twenties when I was living in Boston, I asked someone if

188
00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:22.110
they would just come with me to Philadelphia because I had wanted forever to try a real Philly steak

189
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:29.969
and cheese. Now, I was pastoring a church at that time in Boston and I would turn to this one guy

190
00:41:29.979 --> 00:41:34.510
and I said, hey, are you up for a road trip? And he's like, yeah, sure. Any time pastor, when would

191
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.530
you like to go? How about now? And he's like, are you kidding me? I'm like, no, do you have a

192
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.899
passport? He goes, yeah, good. Um I've got mine on me already. I was going to do this by myself. But

193
00:41:44.909 --> 00:41:49.280
if you're up to it, we can just pass by your house, pick up your passport, we can go. And so we did

194
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:55.320
that and then we just drove to the border and we drove to Philadelphia and then when we did this, we

195
00:41:55.330 --> 00:42:00.699
drove to Philadelphia. We got there and then we had to make a decision, we had to make a decision of

196
00:42:00.709 --> 00:42:07.340
where we were now going to have this Philly steak and cheese. And there's really this thing that

197
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:14.340
tourists do when they go into Philadelphia, besides running up the steps where Rocky ran and the

198
00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:20.500
statue and all that, there's a few spots you want to go check out. But one of them was in the movie

199
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:27.560
Rocky, I saw that Rocky was brought to the, to the restaurant that was called Pats. I said, I want

200
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:32.040
to go to Pat's. And then there was another place called called Geno's. And the thing is that they're

201
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:38.070
both across the street from each other. And so just to give you an idea of what these places look

202
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:45.060
like, we can put up an image of that and you have the image of these two places side by side and you

203
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:51.459
have to kind of go and just try them. So we did this, we tried them and it was amazing. Like we went

204
00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:58.169
to both places and after we had tried both places, we kind of decided that we liked one more than

205
00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:02.300
the other. I'm not going to tell you which one because you need to figure that out for yourself

206
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:07.000
because it's like one of those controversial things that people tend to pick one place over the

207
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:16.760
other. But I did this again when I had moved back to Montreal and I went to the border and I went to

208
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.969
the border and drove to the border and I was with someone again and, and they said, where are you

209
00:43:20.979 --> 00:43:25.239
guys going? He said, we're just gonna go to Philadelphia. How long are you gonna be there? Just to

210
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:32.580
get a sandwich? Oh, I'm like you guys like, are you serious? He's like, yeah, we just, we just, you

211
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:37.010
know, just want to get a steak and cheese. He's like, you're, you're driving all the way to

212
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:43.899
Philadelphia from Montreal to get a steak and cheese. Yeah. Are you guys crazy? I go. No, mainly

213
00:43:43.909 --> 00:43:44.530
hungry.

214
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:53.979
It just had a craving and just wanted to do. So the guy is like, you know, pull over, it was an

215
00:43:53.989 --> 00:44:01.110
automatic stop, an automatic stop delayed for another 40 minutes just because we had made this

216
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:07.010
decision. And then we just like whatever man, like we're going. And so we went, we ate the sandwich

217
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:13.010
and just drove back and brought some back with us. And uh, and then again, on the Canadian side,

218
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:20.350
it's like, where did you guys go? And you can imagine just like just laughing and just a road trip

219
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:27.010
can be fun, right? It can be spontaneous just like it can be planned. And the journey that we're on

220
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:33.070
is, is sometimes planned and sometimes it's just things are happening and it's like things are

221
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.899
happening to us and they're spontaneous even just because of the decisions that we're making. I want

222
00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:46.100
to give you a back story on the Israelites who moved out of Egypt, who were delivered from there and

223
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:52.120
made their way to the promised land to Canaan, a land that God was taking away from its enemies and

224
00:44:52.129 --> 00:44:59.889
now giving to them. And the Israelites had been there for less than 40 days and, and, and after

225
00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:08.250
having pledged to keep the law of Moses, imagine after having pledged this, after Moses had received

226
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:20.350
this, they had already broken the tablets. They had already broken their vow because the golden calf

227
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:28.010
that they had formed was collected from all of their spoils and, and the person who did this who

228
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:35.629
urged them to do it was Aaron. And interestingly enough, Aaron was the guy that God had appointed to

229
00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:45.370
support Moses on the journey. In fact, the Israelites would not have listened to Moses if Aaron

230
00:45:45.379 --> 00:45:56.870
hadn't been the one who had spoken to all the Israelite leaders and said we are going to follow my

231
00:45:56.879 --> 00:46:04.959
brother Moses. He's been chosen as our deliverer. He's going to speak to Pharaoh on our behalf. And

232
00:46:04.969 --> 00:46:13.199
this is what is going to happen next. He will let us go. And so at Aaron's urging, they were

233
00:46:13.209 --> 00:46:26.709
delivered from Egypt. But now at Aaron's urging, they formed a golden calf. And I need you to see

234
00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:34.870
that, that the, that the, the path that Aaron was on is a path that we're on too in the same way

235
00:46:34.879 --> 00:46:45.939
that we can be used by God to deliver. We can also be used by God to enslave. No different. Those

236
00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:54.489
two roads, those two paths, those two journeys are in all of us. And we need to understand that God

237
00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:02.860
was so angered by their reveling and their immorality that He threatened to wipe out the entire

238
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:10.139
nation out from the face of the earth. And he had promised that he was even going to start a new

239
00:47:10.149 --> 00:47:19.860
nation no longer with Abraham. But now with Moses, did you know that you can read about it? In

240
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:29.189
Exodus 32. God says, if this line of people from Abraham are not gonna follow me, then I'm gonna

241
00:47:29.199 --> 00:47:31.860
start a new line of people with you, Moses.

242
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:42.179
It's pretty awesome and pretty frightening at the same time. Awesome because it shows you that you

243
00:47:42.189 --> 00:47:51.209
cannot stop the plan of God and frightening because it's possible that we may be excluding ourselves

244
00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:51.760
from it.

245
00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:59.699
And so what God is saying, I don't want this to be you. I don't want this to be your life. So I'm

246
00:47:59.709 --> 00:48:06.979
going to tell you the stories of my people so that you understand what happens next. And what

247
00:48:06.989 --> 00:48:13.520
happens next is that Moses prays and, and it's, and it's, and it's a time in the scriptures where

248
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:21.929
one of Moses's prayers is, is recorded in the scriptures. It's not often that we get this

249
00:48:21.939 --> 00:48:30.320
opportunity to see what Moses prayed to God. What, what would make God call him a friend, someone

250
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:37.540
that he would want to talk to face to face. But we see in the scriptures that Moses petitions God to

251
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:45.600
spare his people. And even though Moses broke the stone tablets, it, it doesn't get God angry that

252
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:52.750
He did that because what when Moses did that while it looks like it was an act of his own anger,

253
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.709
what he was revealing was God's anger. He was revealing God's wrath. That's why God never judged him

254
00:48:58.719 --> 00:49:08.370
for that. He wasn't judged for that because when you break God's law, that's what it looks like. The

255
00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:10.030
tablets are broken

256
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:23.090
and the covenant that was made is broken. And so what Moses does next is that he smashes the idol

257
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:36.030
that was formed by Aaron and, and Bible says that he melts, it burns it so that it melts and then he

258
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:46.090
ground it into fine powder. And after that, this is the craziest part of the story. He makes all the

259
00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.820
people drink it.

260
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:50.110
Yeah,

261
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.129
and I think to myself, why

262
00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:04.129
I believe that God was showing them

263
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.959
the difference between what it looks like

264
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:26.719
to follow him and experience his blessing or to experience the bitterness from a cup of our own

265
00:50:26.729 --> 00:50:27.239
making.

266
00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:39.709
Do we want to drink from that? Which comes from idols or do we want to drink from that which pours

267
00:50:39.719 --> 00:50:41.729
out directly from God.

268
00:50:44.649 --> 00:50:51.500
God would one day instruct Moses to strike the rock and, and as he would strike, the rock, the water

269
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:58.340
would come and flow from it in the same way that Jesus would be struck on the cross and, and he

270
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:03.129
would be speared in his side and the scripture so that water would flow from Him.

271
00:51:05.149 --> 00:51:11.290
We have an opportunity to drink from the cup of idolatry or we have an opportunity to drink a cup

272
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:18.399
from the savior, a savior that offered the cup to the woman at the well and said, are you not tired

273
00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:25.419
of drinking from this earth from its pleasures and from its corruption and from its Brokenness and

274
00:51:25.429 --> 00:51:31.739
it's from its isolation. And look at you coming at the hottest point in the day, look at you hiding

275
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:38.219
from everyone because you cannot stand even before your peers and not be shamed and judged and not

276
00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:47.179
feel the shame and judge wherever you go. Do you not want to drink from this cup? This cup that I

277
00:51:47.189 --> 00:51:55.679
have for you? This cup that is eternal life right now, we have a choice that we can make a decision

278
00:51:55.689 --> 00:52:03.719
that we can turn to. And we can say I am not going to drink from the cup made from idols. I'm going

279
00:52:03.729 --> 00:52:11.520
to drink from the cup that is made from the Lord King David was this incredible leader. And, and one

280
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.899
of the things that just endeared him to his people was that he did things that no other leader did.

281
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:24.090
One day, he was talking about how he wanted the freshness of water, how he, he just yearned for the

282
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:31.399
water that came from a pool that was under siege. It was impossible to get to. And so one of his

283
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:38.530
mighty warriors hears it and the Bible says that this guy risks his life to go and get him the water

284
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:45.149
and he brings it back to David and David instead of drinking it, he does the unimaginable in front

285
00:52:45.159 --> 00:52:50.659
of the soldier and in front of all the other soldiers that were with him. He takes the water and he

286
00:52:50.669 --> 00:52:59.310
pours it out on the ground and everybody's shocked. And you're thinking, what is David doing? How

287
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:06.290
disrespectful, how dishonoring to this mighty warrior and to the honor that he had to go and get

288
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:13.459
that very thing that he expressed just simply out of desire. Should this man not be honored? Should

289
00:53:13.469 --> 00:53:19.110
he not be praised? Should he not be made of an ex an example of, of what it means to be great and to

290
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.360
do great things.

291
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:31.909
And then David explains that the reason he poured it out in front of the Lord was because it was too

292
00:53:31.919 --> 00:53:36.300
precious to drink. The only person who was worthy of it was God himself.

293
00:53:38.889 --> 00:53:45.719
See, we're used to just drinking what's best? We're used to trying to fill ourselves up with what we

294
00:53:45.729 --> 00:53:54.250
want. We're, we're so used to just gorging on life that we don't understand that when we pour out

295
00:53:54.260 --> 00:54:00.379
our best before the Lord, what the Lord does is that he just makes room for more of his blessing in

296
00:54:00.389 --> 00:54:07.979
us. You never lose out when you pour out in front of the Lord. You never lose out when you sacrifice

297
00:54:07.989 --> 00:54:15.090
and you obey his word, you never lose out on that which quench your thirst. But if you drink from

298
00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:20.860
the things of this world and the things of this life, you will always be thirsty. But Jesus Christ

299
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:29.770
is here to take our thirst away. He's here to quench your thirst. He's here to do it in a way that

300
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:35.560
only he can and, and I need you to think about where in your life you're just, you're just drinking

301
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:39.669
water that has been crushed

302
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.260
and put in a cup for you to drink

303
00:54:47.419 --> 00:54:51.949
because of the mistakes you've made because of the life you've led because of the commandments

304
00:54:51.959 --> 00:54:58.719
you've broken because of the laws you refuse to live by because of the rules you choose to change.

305
00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:06.739
Because of the truth that you alter because of the principles you will not live by. God is saying I

306
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.639
have water for you that can change all that.

307
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:24.179
Now, God, we see a prayer, a beautiful prayer and, and the reason we see this prayer is because at

308
00:55:24.189 --> 00:55:30.530
one point, God says, look, I'm kind of done with this whole people thing. I wanna wipe them all out

309
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:36.649
like they, they just don't get it And I just wanna start over with you Moses and Moses intercedes

310
00:55:36.659 --> 00:55:44.129
like, no, don't do this. I, I I'm here to fulfill the promise that you made to Abraham to Isaac and

311
00:55:44.139 --> 00:55:52.570
to Jacob, it's like I want to continue on that path. I don't want to be the new beginning. I want to

312
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:58.889
be the continuation of what you have begun. OK? I, I don't want to be the beginning of a new journey.

313
00:55:58.899 --> 00:56:05.129
I want to be the continuation of the journey that we've already been on. Can you not bless us? Can

314
00:56:05.139 --> 00:56:10.149
you not show us your favor again? Can you not lead us? Can you not bless us? And he's pleading with

315
00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:16.139
God. And God says, ok, I'm going to fulfill my promise. I'm going to give you the land, but I'm not

316
00:56:16.149 --> 00:56:21.830
gonna go with you. I'm gonna give you an angel instead. And Moses says, absolutely not, but we don't,

317
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:29.050
we don't need an angel. We need you, which is interesting because we live in a world that believes

318
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:37.879
in angels more than they believe in God, a God who created them. People are more willing to follow

319
00:56:37.889 --> 00:56:44.469
angels and pray to them and believe in their protection than they are willing to believe in Jesus

320
00:56:44.479 --> 00:56:45.760
who commands them.

321
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:57.340
It makes no sense for us to ask for angels. When you can ask for Jesus by name, it makes no sense to

322
00:56:57.350 --> 00:57:04.750
rely on angels coming with us. When God is saying, don't you get it when I'm with you, my angels are

323
00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:13.929
with me and wherever I go, they go to, wherever I send them they go to. But Moses understood this.

324
00:57:13.939 --> 00:57:18.719
He's like God. If your presence doesn't come with us, here's what I know. I don't want to go

325
00:57:18.729 --> 00:57:23.199
anywhere. But here's the thing what I've noticed in my life and I've seen this in the life of many

326
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:30.260
that we will choose success over the presence of God. More often than when we care to admit,

327
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:42.679
we will choose pleasure over God's presence coming with us more times than I care to admit. I, I

328
00:57:42.689 --> 00:57:47.419
think that if we're honest with ourselves, we're gonna see that in this life and on this journey

329
00:57:47.429 --> 00:57:55.780
that we're constantly making decisions about finding the best path forward without necessarily

330
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.739
experiencing the right path forward.

331
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:08.530
And God's saying what looks best in this world isn't often, right? What's right is what I have said

332
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:15.629
is right. You cannot take that which is unclean and make it clean. No matter how hard you try. And

333
00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:20.560
what I see is a lot of us as, as followers of Jesus, we're always trying to take an unclean thing

334
00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:25.840
and make it clean. Have you noticed that we're always trying to do that? We're trying to justify it.

335
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:30.290
We're trying to, we're trying to make reasons for it. We're trying to say it's cultural differences.

336
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:35.280
It's this, it's that we're trying to do everything that we can just to say whatever we need to say,

337
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:44.239
just solve that we don't feel or made to be felt like in the presence of others unclean. But there's

338
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:51.409
only one way to be clean and blessed and prosperous. And that is by following what the word of God

339
00:58:51.419 --> 00:59:01.600
says. And so in Exodus chapter 33 and in verse 12, it says that Moses said to the Lord, see you say

340
00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:08.120
to me, bring up this people, but you yourself have not let me know whom you will send with me.

341
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:15.870
Moreover, you have said, I have known you by name and you have also found favor in my sight. Now,

342
00:59:15.879 --> 00:59:23.300
then if I have found favor in your sight in any way, then please let me know your way so that I may

343
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:30.500
know you in order that I may find favor in your sight, consider too that this nation is your people.

344
00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:36.649
And he said my presence, this is God speaking, shall go with you. And then he says, I will give you

345
00:59:36.659 --> 00:59:42.090
rest. And then he said to him, if your presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here.

346
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:49.969
For how then can it be known that I have found favor in your sight? I and your people, is it not by

347
00:59:49.979 --> 00:59:56.239
your going with us? So that we I and your people may be distinguished from all the other people who

348
00:59:56.250 --> 01:00:03.790
are on the face of the earth. And the Lord said to Moses, I will also do this thing of which you

349
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:12.419
have spoken for. You have found favor in my sight. And I have known you by name. Can we ask that the

350
01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:18.080
Lord bless the reading of His word to our hearts? Because I know that the word of God could bless us

351
01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:26.840
in ways that even my explanation of it just can't do we. We are, we are feasting on the man that is,

352
01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:35.320
that is His word. His word is what feeds us is, is what nourishes us. It's what transforms us. And

353
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:44.600
so here's what the promises are because if we're going to consider what it looks like to know who's

354
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:52.649
coming with me, we have to see what God is saying in all of this. And the first thing that God says

355
01:00:52.659 --> 01:01:02.790
to us in this passage that we just read is that you know my name, not only do we know God by name,

356
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:10.479
but he knows your name. And that's so important because if you don't understand this part, then

357
01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:15.209
you're never going to feel special in his eyes. You're going to think that the people that are

358
01:01:15.219 --> 01:01:22.719
special in God's eyes are people like Moses and that excludes us from that. But no, the way it works

359
01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:30.929
is that the blessing that is on Moses is on you. God doesn't just know his name. He knows your name

360
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:38.469
and because He knows your name, this is what he says in verse 12, I have not only known you by name,

361
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:45.189
but you have now found favor in my sight. So not only does He know our name, but verse 12 tells us

362
01:01:45.199 --> 01:01:51.820
that we have also found His favor. So not only does God know you by name, but you have his favor.

363
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:59.949
That means what you have been set apart for is for the privileged relationship and blessing that

364
01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:07.889
favor brings you know, when someone walks in at a banquet, Jesus says he teaches his disciples that

365
01:02:08.129 --> 01:02:18.469
you never take the best place. Never take the best seat, take the seat. That is a reflection of the

366
01:02:18.479 --> 01:02:26.520
humility that you walk around this earth with. That is a reflection of my heart. And then when

367
01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:36.320
someone sees you sitting in a space and they call you up and they give you the best seat in the

368
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:45.669
house, then that's an honor and a favor that you deserve. But don't walk around with the entitlement

369
01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:55.090
believing that wherever you go, you deserve the best seat. And So this is how we understand favor

370
01:02:56.449 --> 01:03:06.479
every day. I choose to humble myself in the presence of friends and enemies in this world, in this

371
01:03:06.489 --> 01:03:13.260
life, in every setting. Because I always walk around with the favor of God.

372
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:24.120
I have no problem humbling myself and becoming a servant leader and serving those around me because

373
01:03:24.129 --> 01:03:31.360
there is someone who knows my name and has already put his favor on my life. You see, there is no

374
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:39.820
honor. Anyone in this life can give me bestow upon me. There is nothing that they can do to improve

375
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:48.909
my status in this world because I already have a God who knows me by name and has given me his favor.

376
01:03:50.649 --> 01:04:00.060
There is nothing that you or anyone anyone else can do for you to you or even because of you, that

377
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:08.429
is more important than God knowing your name and Him giving you his favor. Come on, you believe that

378
01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:17.040
you see when you walk around knowing that God knows your name. When you live your life, knowing that

379
01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:24.840
God has given his favor on you, there is no one and nothing that this world can offer you that is

380
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:34.040
better than that. And you will stay faithful to God because you have a relationship with Him face to

381
01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:41.969
face where you know each other by name and his favor always resides upon you.

382
01:04:43.979 --> 01:04:51.250
And Moses was able to resist the greatest temptations. He didn't fall into the same traps. But he

383
01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:57.560
also saw that, that he could get closer to God. He saw that there was a way for this relationship to

384
01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:04.979
go deeper and, and he knew that it could go one step further and he realized that who came with him

385
01:05:04.989 --> 01:05:10.270
was going to be key. And so when he asks the question, who's coming with me? He's not thinking of

386
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.250
the Israelites. He wants them all to come. He's not trying to exclude them. He's trying to include

387
01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:20.500
them right now. God is the one excluding them. When he says, who's coming with me, he's not thinking

388
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:25.360
of Aaron because we know that Aaron was rebuked for what he did. And then after the rebuke, listen

389
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:32.479
to this, there was 3000 Israelites who still wanted to keep worshiping the calf that he had broken

390
01:05:32.489 --> 01:05:39.459
and ground into dust and made them all drink. There was 3000 of them who refused. And so you know

391
01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:45.879
what needed to happen next? Well, everyone who was a Levite under the authority of Aaron had to kill

392
01:05:45.889 --> 01:05:46.959
the 3000.

393
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:54.270
It's a horrible story, horrible event in the way that it happened. There are details there that

394
01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:03.629
might be surprising you today. And so when, when Moses says, who's coming with me, what he's saying

395
01:06:03.639 --> 01:06:11.389
is God, are you the one who's coming? Because I don't want to go anywhere without you. But here's

396
01:06:11.399 --> 01:06:17.320
what I know you need to do. You need to reveal your plans. I I need to, to go into a deeper

397
01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:23.580
relationship with you. How many of you are tired of the confusion that sometimes is your life? Some

398
01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:31.340
of you are so like just exhausted from the journey, exhausted from trying to serve God and making

399
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:37.770
decisions that kind of lead you away from God instead of closer to Him. Oh God is saying, don't you

400
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.919
understand that when you enter into a relationship with me, this is what I wanna do. I'm going to

401
01:06:42.929 --> 01:06:48.810
reveal my plans to you. And that's what Moses is praying for. And in verse 13, he says, I want you

402
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:54.040
to reveal your plans. He says, now, then if I found favor in your sight in any way, then please let

403
01:06:54.050 --> 01:07:02.040
me know your ways so that I know you in order that I may find favor in your sight. But you know,

404
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:08.629
it's weird because God already said Moses, I know you by name and I've given you my favor. I promise

405
01:07:08.639 --> 01:07:13.080
you that you're gonna make it into the promise land. I'm gonna give you the inheritance that I said

406
01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:21.169
I would. But Moses is saying, no, I, I don't want that. I want you and I don't want that without you.

407
01:07:21.979 --> 01:07:29.250
You see many of us will choose the promise of the blessing without the blessing of the one who makes

408
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.030
the promise.

409
01:07:32.239 --> 01:07:40.090
God is the one that we need. You see without Him, even if He gives you the promise, many of us in

410
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.750
this room would just take it. We're just like, OK, I mean, if that's the way it's gonna be, I mean,

411
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:51.340
it's where I want to go anyways, it's a blessing. You're gonna give me, I already appreciate that.

412
01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:55.580
You know, my name and that you've given me this favor and, and you're giving me this inheritance,

413
01:07:55.590 --> 01:08:01.919
I'm just going to take it. But Moses says that's not enough. Can you get to the place in your life

414
01:08:01.929 --> 01:08:06.659
right now? Maybe you're there already. Maybe you can whisper this as a prayer right now in this

415
01:08:06.669 --> 01:08:13.000
moment. And you're going to say out loud in your mind screaming it if you have to, to God, God, I

416
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:24.020
don't want just your blessing. I want you. That is my blessing. If I have you, everything will be

417
01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:30.680
blessed. Anybody else believe that today, anybody else believe that trust God for that.

418
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:42.709
And so God promises to reveal his plans to Moses and he says, God, I'm going to promise to guide you.

419
01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:47.979
So when God makes a promise, the promise isn't just to reveal His plans, but it's to guide us every

420
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:53.810
step of the way. And that's why in verse 14, he says, my presence shall go with you and I'm going to

421
01:08:53.819 --> 01:09:00.060
give you rest. And then part of 14, he says that I'm going to give you rest. So the promise isn't

422
01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:05.819
just that He's going to guide us. The promise is that He's going to give us rest. Sometimes we go on

423
01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:08.740
vacation, we come back and we're more tired than when we left.

424
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:16.089
We're just exhausted because we didn't experience any real rest. We didn't rest our minds. We didn't

425
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:23.180
rest our spirit. We didn't rest our finances. We didn't, we didn't rest in the presence of God the

426
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:31.120
way that God can replenish us and restore us the way that He can bring multiplication into our lives.

427
01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:36.930
But God says that when we follow him and we make this decision of who's coming with me. And we say,

428
01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:43.680
God, it's you who's coming with me no matter where I go, I want you with me. Then God says, I'm

429
01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:50.290
gonna promise to guide you and then I'm gonna promise to give you rest. Many of us are exhausted

430
01:09:50.299 --> 01:09:57.950
because we don't spend time in the presence of God. You see, the day of rest is spent in the

431
01:09:57.959 --> 01:10:05.879
presence of God. We experience rest when we rest from our labors and spend it with the Father. When

432
01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:11.560
we spend it the way that Jesus did where he ceased all activity. And then he poured his life out

433
01:10:11.569 --> 01:10:17.089
before the Lord and received the rest, the strength, the courage, the wisdom, the guidance,

434
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:23.250
everything that he needed for the next step of the journey. See, God wants you to experience that

435
01:10:23.259 --> 01:10:31.509
too. So he doesn't just promise to guide you. He promises to give you rest and then here's them. The

436
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.720
key thing of the whole thing that we've been talking about. And it's in verse 15

437
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.870
and the answer here is go only if God goes with you.

438
01:10:45.279 --> 01:10:53.600
If you take this principle to heart, you will not make a bad decision in your life. Even if you

439
01:10:53.609 --> 01:11:01.799
don't know where it is in the scriptures that it's written. If this is a good thing or a bad thing,

440
01:11:02.939 --> 01:11:08.319
if this is a thing that's going to bless you or curse you. If this is something that is going to

441
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:15.509
hold you back or propel you to the next level, I need you to know that all you have to ask yourself

442
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:23.750
is this the two things that Jesus brought to our attention. He took all of the law that was

443
01:11:23.759 --> 01:11:33.640
comprised on the tablets and all of the laws that were comprised by the scribes and Pharisees 6000

444
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:41.990
more rules. And Jesus says, I just need you to do two things. I need you to love God and I need you

445
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.669
to love people. If you will love God and you will love people. Here's what's going to happen. My

446
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:58.830
presence is always going to flow not just in your life but in this world because they are the banks

447
01:11:58.839 --> 01:12:06.770
of the river for the power of the Holy Spirit that needs to move powerfully in your life and in this

448
01:12:06.779 --> 01:12:16.620
world and all you need to do is ask yourself um I do this, does it love God? If the answer is no,

449
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:17.720
then you don't go.

450
01:12:20.009 --> 01:12:26.180
All you have to do is ask yourself, does this love people the way that God wants me to? If the

451
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:28.799
answer is no, then you don't go

452
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:37.140
and we will never be lost again. And we will always have the presence of God with us. And no matter

453
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:43.839
what happens in this life, we will only go if God comes with us,

454
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:54.700
go only if God goes with you. And then He said, if your presence does not go with us, then do not

455
01:12:54.709 --> 01:13:04.370
lead us up from here. Moses says, I'm not gonna go anywhere without you. Oh man, I, I want that to

456
01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:12.419
be my prayer every day. I want that to be my conviction and my commitment. How about you? I don't

457
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:17.390
want to go without you. God, I don't want to do this life without you. God, I don't want to

458
01:13:17.399 --> 01:13:22.140
experience the blessings of this life without you. I'm not going to settle for your angels. I'm only

459
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:29.319
going to settle for you. I want you to come with me from where I am to where you need me to be from

460
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:33.910
what you have promised me. Why? Because you love me, you know me by name and you've given me your

461
01:13:33.919 --> 01:13:40.890
favor and you have set us apart for that blessing. The last verse is verse 16 and it says, and it's

462
01:13:40.899 --> 01:13:50.700
not just by your going with us so that we, I and your people may be distinguished. Look at this from

463
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:58.600
all the other people who are on the face of the earth. This is what sets us apart is that we have a

464
01:13:58.609 --> 01:14:01.029
God who goes with us

465
01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:09.259
and that is what sets you apart today. Are you ready to receive that in your life? To have that in

466
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:16.540
your life? Are you ready to experience that in your life to live according to this truth in your

467
01:14:16.549 --> 01:14:22.870
life? Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. But the beautiful thing about God is that he doesn't

468
01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:28.720
just tell you what to do. It gives you the power to do it. And so every day when you feel like you

469
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:33.490
can't do it and every day that you feel like you're slipping back into your old ways and you feel

470
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:38.270
that you can't commit to what it is that he's saying and what he has said and what he's telling you

471
01:14:38.279 --> 01:14:43.430
to do in this moment. I need you to remember that when God says I know your name. It's because he's

472
01:14:43.439 --> 01:14:49.850
in a relationship with you. When he says I've given you my favor, it's because He has set you apart

473
01:14:49.859 --> 01:14:50.709
for his blessing.

474
01:14:52.899 --> 01:14:56.970
And you need to understand that in this moment, just like every moment of your life, God doesn't

475
01:14:56.979 --> 01:15:05.870
just reveal himself so that He can tell you who you're not. He's revealed himself so you can become

476
01:15:06.129 --> 01:15:14.890
everything that He has created. You always to be. And that's who God is for you today. He is the one

477
01:15:14.899 --> 01:15:20.899
who has set you apart. So let's be set apart and let's distinguish ourselves in this world and in

478
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:29.750
this life and from everyone else in this world, let us be different because when we serve God, we

479
01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:37.060
automatically are different and it's because of His presence. God bless you guys,

480
01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.200
just going to take a moment to pray and just to sing one more song and then this band comes back and

481
01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:54.120
they uh teach us a new song and as we sing this song together, I just hope that at the end of this

482
01:15:54.129 --> 01:15:58.189
gathering, you guys can just stick around. I see some faces that I haven't seen in a while. It's

483
01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:06.459
great to see you guys. I mean, Olivier, it's awesome. Michael. How are you doing, Peter? Nice to see

484
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:14.140
you. It's amazing. Um And so many others here, man. I just love it. I love it and I'm so glad that

485
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:19.479
you guys are here. I'm so glad that you're a part of this and I hope that today was a blessing for

486
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:24.209
you as well. I know it's hot in here and they're gonna turn up the fans in a moment. We got a

487
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:31.540
squeaky one right above here that um they, they just turn the fans down because it makes too much

488
01:16:31.549 --> 01:16:37.830
noise while I'm speaking, but they're going to turn them back up in a moment and um I'm going to

489
01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:47.439
pray that God blesses us. I'm gonna pray His blessing on our lives. I'm gonna pray that we would

490
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:52.560
choose God more than anyone or anything else

491
01:16:54.779 --> 01:16:58.870
that we would be committed to Him in the same way that He has made this commitment to us already.

492
01:17:00.439 --> 01:17:05.819
It's a father. You see each person here, the blessing. They are the blessing. They wanna be the

493
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:12.890
blessing that they have been trying to experience, but also to bring to others. Lord, I pray that

494
01:17:12.899 --> 01:17:21.930
you would reveal yourself to them, that you would call them by name, remind them of your favor, give

495
01:17:21.939 --> 01:17:30.180
them your presence so they can take the steps that they need to take in this life on this journey

496
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:40.080
that they are on. Lord. You are able to do so much more. Yeah, than what we are so accustomed to

497
01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:40.649
having.

498
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:48.379
You don't want us to have scraps from your table. You want us to sit at your table

499
01:17:51.009 --> 01:17:57.939
and partake in the banquet that you have put before us. And so Lord right now, I wanna pray that you

500
01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:06.939
would bless every person here who has a seat at your table, who has been put before a feast at your

501
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:18.250
table and that you would bless them and the life that they live for your honor and glory in Jesus

502
01:18:18.259 --> 01:18:26.750
name. We pray. Amen. Amen. Receive that blessing over you and over your families and over your life.

503
01:18:26.759 --> 01:18:30.910
I wanna invite you to stand and as you do that.

504
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:38.979
Let's worship this song with this song together as the, the team leads us. Would you welcome the

505
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:48.910
River's Edge team again? Thank you. This new song from Mosaic is called "To Your Arms." And it's good for this message series about

506
01:18:48.919 --> 01:18:56.339
getting there because it talks about us running straight to the arms of our Lord who is waiting for us and how

507
01:18:56.350 --> 01:19:03.330
we can't imagine how we deserve his great love. And it's just really great to be encouraged and I encourage you

508
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:04.990
to sing these words with all your heart.

512
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.089
You're all dismissed. Have a wonderful Canada Day. Take care.
