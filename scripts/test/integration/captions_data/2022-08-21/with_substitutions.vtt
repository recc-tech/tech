00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.480
Hey, good morning, how are you? Good. I hope you're enjoying this. Yeah, I like that, wow, pretty

2
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:36.360
intense. C'est le fun Ã§a. So, so it's a beautiful day and you know what I was thinking when I was driving

3
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:46.330
from home to church this morning, I was saying that's a beautiful day to enjoy a pool or a bath or a

4
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.420
shower. And if you don't have any of these, you can obviously ask someone who have, so that's a

5
00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:01.490
really good occasion to enjoy that and to stay in the automatic on the thematic of water. We do have

6
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:09.510
water baptism this morning, so the water tank is filling slowly with super cold water and

7
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:20.250
it's hot water. So don't be afraid for those who were considering baptism, don't be afraid. It's not

8
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:27.310
cold water. It's not really a test of physical strength, it's really more a demonstration of our

9
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.330
faith and what is happening into our hearts. So it's gonna be a wonder Sunday. I'm really excited to

10
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:39.230
be there and really excited also for all of you being there as well. So we're continuing our senior

11
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:50.330
or series, the genius of Jesus um and this is based on the book of Erwin McManus. Um and today it's

12
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:58.610
the genius of the good and what it means to use power to sacrifice Strategy Boys. Sacrificial

13
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:05.430
Sacrificially serve others. Eee, I'm sorry if I hurt your hair's okay this morning, so please come

14
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:12.270
again. Okay, I'm just practicing. It's a special program for introducing people who have problems to,

15
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:19.200
to talk english properly. So I'm part of that special problem program. Not problem and the church

16
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.135
gets subsidized for that. Okay, so please be tolerated about that. Okay, thanks. So, having said

17
00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:32.325
that, just wanted to let you know that obviously you come as you are. No matter what are your

18
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:38.195
beliefs, No matter, no matter where you are in your lives, no matter no matter what you are living,

19
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:45.670
we're all human beings and we're belonging to that community, no matter what are your belief at that

20
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:52.810
single point in time in your journey. So let's just do that journey together and um it's a good

21
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:59.640
opportunity to be able to learn from each other as well. So that's really the community that we want

exciting things that we get to do is we get to celebrate the life that God is at work in and the

46
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:59.500
lives that God is changing and today we're celebrating two of those lives and so would you welcome

49
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:27.030

50
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:35.590
to be uh taking part in this event right now because um I never thought that I would get to this

51
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:43.090
point in my life, I went through some, some dark times and some, some lonely times, but through the

52
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:50.350
grace of the Lord, he pushed me and kept pushing me and now I get to be on this stage right now with

53
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:57.460
my fiancee, my future wife and we're getting baptized together. So

54
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:05.210
I just wanna say thank you, thank you Lord for allowing me this and just giving me your grace and

55
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:11.460
your love to continue in Jesus mighty name. Amen hmm.

56
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:21.360
First I want to start off by just thanking our father Lord God if it wasn't for him, I honestly

57
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.950
don't know where I would be, he just works miracles in my life, I've had a lot of hard times like

58
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.780
all of us. But one thing I always held on to was that faith and I'm just grateful to be here in

59
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:42.410
front of my beautiful family, my mother, my father, my Children and my grandmother And he's a

60
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:49.940
miracle worker. And if he could work miracles and bring us back together after 13 years 13 years we

61
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:55.260
were apart. But God had a plan that whole time we were apart. He knew that today we would be

62
00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:04.940
standing here doing this. Even I just thank you Lord and I recognize that he is our Lord and savior.

63
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:12.470
I accept Jesus Christ into my life today and I'm gonna fight to the very end. Thank you.

64
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.490
Alright, we're gonna do cal first

65
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.960

66
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.080
Is it like too hot? That's okay.

67
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:34.680
Mhm.

68
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.260
Okay.

69
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:52.180
That's it. So based on your confession of faith, Khalin, I baptize you in the name of the father and

70
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.650
the son and the Holy Spirit one God.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:58.990
and every day after this day will be about glorifying you, you're going to use him more greatly more

76
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:09.680
powerfully than ever before. You will put your words in his mouth and he will speak life and truth

77
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.490
in Jesus name. We pray Amen.

And community kitchen was is something that at the heart of what we're trying to do at River's Edge,

168
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:22.900
we really want to help and be able to bless people around the neighborhood in the community and

169
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:29.050
community kitchen is about that. And it's been really tough to be able to reconstruct that ministry.

170
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:36.010
But now there's a team of volunteers, There's wonderful leaders also there. So you've seen the

171
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:41.470
excellent work that has been done and we've talked about that for months and months and months and

172
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:49.400
years and finally things are really starting slowly. So the first meal will be distributed in in

173
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:56.780
September. So that's a wonderful news. And we wanted to inform you about that. So today for the kids,

174
00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:05.200
there's no kids program, there's a little rest and for the all the school teacher. So kids will stay

175
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.940
with you today. There's some games at the back if you want to entertain, it's cheaper version of the

176
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:18.880
ipad. So we'll migrate slowly with an ipad eventually. But right now it's the ipad where you draw

177
00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:24.970
what you want to see. Okay, So it's still evolved, but it's just a little bit slower in terms of

178
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:32.940
refresh rate for the screen. Okay, So please grab that old version of the ipad for your kids. And if

179
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:39.020
some of you also are sleeping, that's maybe a good thing to grab. Also to make sure you stay awake.

180
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:49.200
All that Wonderful morning. So also there is a youth program. So for the youth 7 to 11 years old in

186
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:34.190
generous through the years, the month and through that summer season, summer season is always a

187
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:40.180
season where we see a little bit dip in the attendance but this summer you're all there. That's

188
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.260
really good and it's really encouraging to see you all, also. So if you want to support

189

190
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:55.990
ways here in front and there's obviously other way to give to the community like that wonderful team

191
00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:02.770
that we saw earlier that is supporting community kitchen. So please give generously to be able to

192
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:10.920
support all of those ministry. So talking about vacation earlier, there's also a vacation for the

193
00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:21.500
after party. So it will resume in September so this week and next week there is no after party but

194
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:28.220
this will be resumed in September So that's basically what I wanted to share with you this morning

195
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:35.050
about the announcement. So can you welcome with me Pastor Lorenzo for the suite of our gathering

196
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:17.130
as we walk in, learn how to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. We have this understanding of what he

197
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:24.680
has to offer us is so much more than what we could ever imagine for ourselves and that's saying a

198
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:33.550
lot because I think that when we think of the plans that we have for us, the dreams, the goals that

199
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:41.950
we've set for ourselves to think that God, what he has in store can exceed all of that. It just

200
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:50.400
blows my mind and I'm sure it blows yours as to if you think of that because I don't always feel

201
00:35:50.400 --> 00:36:00.390
like I'm realizing my dreams or the vision I have for myself or the plans that I have made for

202
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:08.760
myself and when I see those things fall apart or not come to fruition, the way that I imagined, they

203
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:19.910
would not be realized the way that I expected. I feel like if I can't even realize these, these

204
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:28.950
dreams that seem so unrealizable to me, how could God possibly have something even greater than that?

205
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:38.890
Until I understand that when I surrender everything that I think I need and want and must have in my

206
00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:48.450
life and I reach instead for what God has to offer. Then all of a sudden my dreams start coming true.

207
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:59.090
My plans begin to be realized. All of a sudden my goals become achievable.

208
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.160
My life begins to reflect

209
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:17.100
the God that has created me and you in his image. And when we think of all that Jesus has come to

210
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:25.450
reveal, we sometimes think that we've got this understood, we've got it figured out we know enough

211
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:36.480
instead of realizing that we are in a spiritual journey where we are continuously unlearning what we

212
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:49.160
think we've learned and no for what Jesus is ready to teach us a new and everything Jesus did in the

213
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:55.870
scriptures was about giving a newfound perspective and understanding of what it meant to be in

214
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.700
relationship with God.

215
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.970
And the religious leaders of his day were especially angry with him over this. They had murderous

216
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:16.800
thoughts and intent towards him on a daily basis when he began to perform miracles and contest their

217
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:25.220
teachings and interpretations of the scriptures. And as you went along doing these things, their

218
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:35.420
anger towards Jesus increased because they saw the world in right and wrong. When Jesus came to show

219
00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:45.580
them that there was a higher way of seeing and understanding things and it was understanding what is

220
00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:54.750
good and today we're gonna talk about the genius of the good and there's this beautiful passage in

221
00:38:54.750 --> 00:39:01.690
Matthew chapter 14 where Jesus gives this incredible teaching that we're gonna look at verse by

222
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:08.300
verse and it's gonna begin at verse one. And I want you to follow with me on the screen as we see

223
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:16.040
that when Herod and took past, the ruler of Galilee heard about Jesus, he said to his advisors,

224
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:22.890
there must be this must be john the baptist who was raised from the dead. That is why he can do such

225
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:30.410
miracles. And for Herod had arrested and imprisoned Jon as a favor to his wife. Hera odious, The

226
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:38.310
former wife of Herod's brother Philip and john had been telling Herod, It is against God's law for

227
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:44.690
you to marry her and Herod wanted to kill john but he was afraid of a ride because all the people

228
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:51.170
believed john was a prophet. But at a birthday party for Herod Herod, his daughter performed the

229
00:39:51.170 --> 00:40:00.690
dance that greatly pleased him. So he promised with a vow to give her anything that she wanted. And

230
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:07.540
at her mother's urging, the girl said, I want the head of john the baptist on a tray. And then the

231
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.810
king regretted what he had said. But because of the vow that he had made in front of his guests, he

232
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:20.860
issued the necessary orders. And so john was beheaded in the prison and his head was brought on a

233
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:28.990
tray and given to the girl who took it to her mother. And later john's disciples came for his body

234
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.980
and they buried it and then they went and told Jesus what had happened. And as soon as Jesus heard

235
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.770
the news, he left in a boat to a remote area to be alone. But the crowds heard where he was headed

236
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:47.270
and they followed on foot from many towns. And then Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the

237
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:51.800
boat and he had compassion on them and then he healed their sick

238
00:40:54.730 --> 00:41:00.270
and we're gonna stop there and we're gonna continue. Um And so when we see this passage in this

239
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:10.350
story, it's a story of john and the fact that Jesus actually never comes to his rescue, John wanted

240
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:18.950
Jesus to rescue him. And there was a point during his imprisonment when he turns to his disciples

241
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:26.520
and he sends a message to Jesus and the message to Jesus was one of are you the Messiah? Are you the

242
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:35.460
promised one? And and Jesus in a crowd cannot at this moment speak clearly and openly about who he

243
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:42.070
is. And so in that moment he responds with the scripture that he knows that john will understand and

244
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:48.960
in that moment he says, I know you're looking for me to declare whether or not I am the Messiah and

245
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:57.200
will rescue you from imminent death, but I'm gonna tell you this instead, that those that are blind,

246
00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:05.840
see those that are deaf, hear those that are lame and crippled, walk and the dead, they're raised

247
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:13.290
back to life. And when they brought back that message to john, it was enough for Don, he gave him

248
00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:20.760
the courage to face his death. He knew that he wasn't going to be rescued from that prison, He knew

249
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:28.040
that his life would be lost. But more importantly, he knew that he died doing what was right, saying

250
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:35.140
what was right, living for what was right and his life at the end had more meaning than anyone

251
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:46.940
else's who would have gone along with just what Herod wanted for people to hear Herod was doing that,

252
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:59.120
which was in God's eyes wrong, it was sinful in his sight. It was something that john called out, He

253
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:10.540
spoke the truth about it and he spoke it in a way that made John enemy number one because his wife

254
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:20.220
went to the king and said, you have to take care of this. This is embarrassing. This is shameful.

255
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:28.840
How can you allow one person to speak this way against us? You who are the most powerful in this

256
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:36.990
kingdom? You're afraid of someone who is not as powerful as you. But she misunderstood. What real

257
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:45.490
power was she misunderstood? What real truth was She misunderstood what was really happening in this

258
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:53.530
story? And instead of it being an opportunity for them to turn away from what had been wrong in

259
00:43:53.530 --> 00:44:02.630
their lives. God was now showing everyone else through john's sacrifice. That standing for the truth

260
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:11.920
sometimes means it doesn't go well for you. It's hard isn't it? Sometimes it's just easier to go

261
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:20.420
with what everybody else is doing. But what is beautiful about Jesus is that in the story, he

262
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:30.120
doesn't have to repeat what john has already said. We don't see him backing up john the way we would

263
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:39.180
think he would need to back him up because what john had said was truth and you know what everybody

264
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:46.650
in the kingdom knew it, but no one had the courage to stand up and say it. And I honestly believe

265
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:54.470
that what God is looking for is not for us to go around thinking that we are living a perfect life.

266
00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:00.580
But honestly just be true with who we are, where we've been,

267
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.570
where we're headed

268
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:18.460
and how God can lead us all to a better place if we will finally just allow for the truth to just

269
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:28.290
simply be the truth the way that he is speaking it to us, revealing it to us, convicting us. You

270
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.250
know that that that inner

271
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:37.970
voice that we keep trying to strangle to death.

272
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:51.180
We just wanted to stop telling us what we know needs to change. You know that voice, Anyone else

273
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.880
ever hear that? You know what's amazing about that voice? You cannot kill it.

274
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:06.530
It survives every assault. It doesn't matter where you go what you do, how you try to get rid of it.

275
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:16.350
It is always there. It's a voice that not even medication could suppress. They can't do it because

276
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:24.260
it's the Holy Spirit. And you cannot silence the voice of God. Yeah, there is nothing that can keep

277
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:33.770
you from keeping that voice out of your life. And I love the way that Jesus brings us to a place

278
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:41.350
where he wants to elevate our understanding of right and wrong by telling us what is good instead.

279
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:49.210
And I love the fact that at the beginning of the scriptures God looks at what he has done and says

280
00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:58.140
it is good because this standard is not right and wrong. It's not darkness and just simply light, it

281
00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:09.870
is either it is good or it is not. And so what God wants us to do is to stop thinking in right and

282
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:16.970
wrong and start thinking, is this just simply good? Is it good for me? Is it good for everyone

283
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:23.070
around me? Is it good? According to the heart of God and according to what the scriptures reveal is

284
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:28.790
that the standard by which I'm going to stand on because in the time of Jesus, the reason they

285
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:37.050
wanted to kill him so badly was because he kept breaking the rules, especially as it was concerning

286
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:44.390
the sabbath. Now the sabbath was a day of rest, in which that day was about honoring God and not

287
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.650
entering into physical activity because in the same way that God had entered his rest after creation,

288
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:58.820
he wanted everyone to follow that pattern and to take a day of rest in the course of a week and in

289
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:05.890
that course of a week, there were times when Jesus would be seen healing people on the sabbath and

290
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:14.160
there was one particular moment in which he says to the man with a withered hand, he says to that

291
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:23.710
man, be healed and then Jesus gets in that moment accused of doing that, which is wrong because on

292
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:31.790
the sabbath you were not to do any works that meant if if a donkey had fallen into a ditch, that

293
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:39.140
donkey would have to be left there to die and that meant if a man had a withered hand and Jesus came

294
00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:46.500
along and had the power to heal him, Jesus because it was the sabbath needed to keep walking on by

295
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:55.160
and not heal the man, Why? Because it was written, it was translated and interpreted to mean that,

296
00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:01.630
and everyone who was religious and everyone who knew what was right and what was wrong knew that

297
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:09.840
what Jesus had done was wrong, and so Jesus turns around and he heals the man with the withered hand

298
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:17.800
anyways, because Jesus was not interested in right and wrong, he was interested in what was good,

299
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:30.160
see what religion does and this is where we can all get trapped is that we can get stuck so hard and

300
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:39.100
so deep and so far down this the well of what we think is right and wrong, that we stop thinking

301
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:46.630
about what is good, what Jesus does is that he elevates our thinking to move past right and wrong

302
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:54.440
and look at what is good the way that God sees it. You see, they were walking through the fields and

303
00:49:54.450 --> 00:50:01.280
they were picking grain and eating it and they had done two things wrong on this day and they were

304
00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:06.890
witnesses to it. And they came to Jesus and they came to his disciples and they said, how dare you

305
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:14.750
walk in these fields on a sabbath? How dare your disciples with unclean hands having now washed

306
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:25.440
themselves eaten grains of wheat in the field and Jesus looks at them and he says, do you not

307
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:34.260
remember the day in which David, who was the anointed king of Israel, fleeing from Saul with his

308
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:42.780
mighty men when they walked into the temple and they ate the bread that was on the altar that was

309
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:52.540
left there for the priest to distribute and to offer their sacrifice. In that moment we accept that

310
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:58.590
what David did was okay. But you criticize me and my disciples for this

311
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.730
isn't what David did wrong,

312
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:13.410
did he not that which was forbidden? It could only be touched by the priests.

313
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:26.290
Did he not eat a sacrifice that was being offered to God? Did he not do what was wrong? And yet he

314
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.990
is honored for doing what is good.

315
00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:38.880
You see there are moments in our lives where it's gonna be so clear to us that that moment isn't a

316
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:48.830
right and wrong moment. It is one where we are being shown what is good instead, and we have to have

317
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:55.080
the eyes to see this, the ears to hear it the moment in our hearts to understand it. I'm not talking

318
00:51:55.080 --> 00:52:01.440
about distorting the word of God to please us. I'm not talking about denying the truth of the word

319
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:07.130
so that we can just keep living the way that we want. I'm not talking about any of that. I'm talking

320
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:15.330
about really doing good. They came to Jesus and they said, you cannot go to Jackie's house, don't

321
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:19.370
you know who he is, He's stolen from everybody in this town.

322
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.560
And Jesus says,

323
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:29.720
today I'm going to eat with Zacchaeus and his friends

324
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:39.690
because I don't care about you're right and you're wrong, I care about what is good. Can we say amen

325
00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:47.710
to that? I care about what is good. And when he went and he sat with them, what happened? God

326
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:54.300
changed and transforms the case. The case comes out of that meal completely a different person and

327
00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:02.300
he decides to give everybody back the money that he stole four times the amount. Because you keep a

328
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:08.230
ledger, what was supposed to go to the hebrews, what was supposed to go to the Romans and what was

329
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:16.930
supposed to go to him. And so he knew what he had taken from everybody. He was good with numbers, I

330
00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:17.280
do it

331
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:27.440
and he knew that no one would believe that he was truly changed until he did something that was

332
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.150
truly good.

333
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:36.630
And so he gave everybody back four times what he stole and it was no longer. But what was right and

334
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:46.230
what was wrong? It was only about what was good and Zacchaeus showed everybody that he proved it. And

335
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:54.110
he proved that Jesus had done in his life what was good. You see, Jesus wants us to experience a

336
00:53:54.110 --> 00:54:03.460
transformation of our own intention and he wants us to live life through the most good that is

337
00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:10.680
possible. Can we say Amen to that the most good. that is possible. That's what he wants to

338
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:16.650
accomplish. That's what he wants to do in all of us. And so we just have to ask ourselves, is it

339
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:28.090
good to do good on the day that honors God? And is that all the good that we are going to do? Are we

340
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:37.950
going to do the good that honors God every day? Because every day is an opportunity for us to reveal

341
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:44.070
the sabbath in the way that we live. That any day could be the sabbath. That any day could be a

342
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:50.260
declaration of how we can honor God, How we can live for him, How we can do good for him. That any

343
00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:57.170
day is an opportunity for us to do good and not get stuck in the minutia of the right and the wrong,

344
00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:06.420
but to find a way to love God and to love people the way that he has commanded us. That is the good

345
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:14.120
that he is asking us to do. That is the good that he wants to reveal in us and through us, that the

346
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:20.870
religious always would rather keep the rules than do good. It's more important for them that the

347
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:27.690
rules are kept. The rules are more important than anything. They don't know what grace is. They

348
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:33.410
don't understand what it looks like to forgive truly a person, to give them another opportunity to

349
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:39.130
give them another chance to give them another way to show them that they are still loved, even

350
00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:47.780
though what they did was wrong. It's okay to love people. It's okay to love them deeply. It's okay

351
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:56.220
to love them and want to do good for them, even when they have done wrong, it is okay. And Jesus

352
00:55:56.230 --> 00:56:05.620
over and over again shows us this and reveals us this never use religion to be blinded

353
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:18.610
by the rules when the needs of humanity are so clearly before us, when Jesus got out of that boat

354
00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:27.560
man, he didn't say my disciples here are gonna take down your names, we're gonna give you a number

355
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:35.050
and hopefully I can get to every single one of you. But when I got on that boat and I took my

356
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:42.630
vacation, I didn't expect you guys to just like hijack it like that. I came to take my day of rest

357
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:49.680
on this beach. I don't know what you guys are all doing here, I'll see you all tomorrow or in seven

358
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:57.970
days. Didn't you get my out of office response when you sent an email, what are you doing in my face

359
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:07.780
today? When it's my day of rest, Jesus gets out of the boat and he heals every one of them because

360
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:15.060
it was more important to do good than to just simply do what he had imagined was right for him. Do

361
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:20.730
you understand what's happening in the stories? It wasn't about what was right and wrong, it was

362
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:27.000
about what was good and what needed to happen is that every one of them needed to be touched. Every

363
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.490
one of them needed to be healed. Every one of them needed to receive something from God that day and

364
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:38.960
he wasn't going to be the one who turned them away. And neither should we when we are in a moment

365
00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:44.730
where we know God is speaking to us guys, there have been times when I've been drained, I've been so

366
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:51.630
tired, I've been so exhausted and then someone says, I need to see you, I need to talk to you. I

367
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:57.500
need to be with you. I need to somehow figure out what's happening in my life. And in that moment I

368
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:03.250
don't think about what's right and wrong. I just think about what is good. And if I don't do what is

369
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:10.690
good in that moment, this person may never want to reach out again, not to me, they may find

370
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:15.900
somebody else, but they won't want to reach out to God and I can't have that on my conscience. You

371
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:26.810
see, we have to be about what is good, doing good is always based on one's essence and not one's

372
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:35.380
performance. I want God to show me what good is. I want him to teach me what good is in every moment

373
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:41.490
of my life, not about following rules that tell my performance, that I'm doing what is right and

374
00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:46.790
what is wrong. I don't need that I don't need those rules. I want to be good from the inside like he

375
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:55.530
was, I want to show me what goodness is, I want to do good in this world the way that he did. I want

376
00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:03.980
to be good because there is no standard that is higher. There is no way of thinking that is better.

377
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:13.510
God is saying it's not about right or wrong, it's about being good. Jesus stood before haters and

378
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:22.160
went to the cross because he was good through and through. He showed us what good was. Was it right

379
00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:30.680
that he was tried that way under lies? No. Was it right that they released but rabbits instead of

380
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:41.270
him? No, was it right? That all the charges of him saying things were twisted out of context so they

381
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:51.500
could accuse him, Was that right? No, but Jesus willingly went to the cross because it was good. He

382
00:59:51.500 --> 01:00:04.360
gave his life for all of us because it was good, Jesus and that's who we are following. We are

383
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.940
following the only one that is good

384
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:18.200
and he teaches us to be good. Yeah. You know living your life always trying to do the right thing is

385
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.370
exhausting and it's so unrewarding

386
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:29.670
and we also often just get it wrong. Is anybody else like that.

387
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:36.540
And when that happens to us, you know what I've learned in my life when people were looking at me

388
01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:43.740
and say pastor, How did you, how did you, how did you get rid of those habits when you were just

389
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:50.440
starting out? How did you break those chains that were on you? How did how did you leave those

390
01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:57.480
things behind? So my answer was: I just didn't have time for them anymore. I was too busy doing good.

391
01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:58.640
Oh

392
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.380
I was just too busy doing good. See the more time I had on my hands, the worst hours with that time.

393
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.910
Do you understand what I'm saying? Do not trust me with time,

394
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:21.110
I will mess that up, I will do the wrong thing nine times out of 10. You give me time and I'm gonna

395
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:28.180
do something wrong with it. So I learned, I'm gonna get busy doing good and when I got busy doing

396
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.690
good, guess what? I didn't have any more time for my bad habits.

397
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:46.680
There was no more time going there, doing that, seeing him doing this, doing that no more time

398
01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:50.790
taking that ingesting that no more time.

399
01:01:53.280 --> 01:02:01.240
No more time because I was too busy doing good. You want to break habits in your life, start doing

400
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:09.810
good, start going in the direction of that, which is good because it's never about what is right and

401
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:18.510
wrong, that is not what it is, it is always about what is good and if that becomes your standard.

402
01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:26.560
Hey, there is no one and nothing in this world, nothing in this life that is gonna stop you because

403
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.880
they couldn't stop Jesus and they can't stop you either because that which is good is forever in you.

404
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:36.460
Amen hallelujah praise God

405
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:47.830
would you stand with me as you would close in a word of prayer. Father, I want to thank you for every

406
01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:55.070
person here and just for the way that you are walking me, each of us into your good, your

407
01:02:55.070 --> 01:03:00.470
understanding of that and your expression of that and your freedom of that and the way that we have

408
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:07.140
been delivered by that, how you were teaching us to do good instead of being trapped by our habits

409
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:12.450
and how you were showing us that it's not about right and wrong, but it's about doing good the way

410
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:19.670
you did it Lord thank you that you are freeing us from the bondage is of the past and how you are in

411
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:28.360
this moment giving us a newfound understanding of what it looks like to be good, like you are good

412
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:37.660
to follow in your footsteps when you said the words be perfect, like my father in heaven is perfect,

413
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:48.700
you were saying do good and Lord I thank you that today, we have understood that a little bit better

414
01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:56.040
and we pray this in Jesus name, Amen, Amen, God bless you guys thank you so much. So we got one more

01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:08.830
appreciate also the message. I hope you appreciate it as well. Everything also is available on our

454
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:14.870
website. So if you want to stay connected through the week, you can go on our website. That's the

455
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:20.900
best way also to connect with our pastor as well. And also if you want, if you have missed some

456
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:27.020
of the elements this morning and you want to watch that again, Go on the website. All the resources

457
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:32.400
are there. We want to thank you again for your generosity. Don't for don't forget if you want to

458
01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:39.070
support us, there's a machine at the end. There's four ways to give, as we've mentioned earlier. So,

459
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:47.520
um, and lastly there is no after party as a pastor. Lorenzo explained. So the only thing missing is

460
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.220
to see you see you next Sunday. I hope you'll be good this week and live good this week. Take care,

461
01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:54.960
Bye bye
