10
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.480
well, welcome to River's Edge, We're so glad that you could be with us and it's always great to see

11
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.610
people who didn't have plans on a long weekend. So good to be here with you. It's always so tough

12
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:31.590
during the summer too. Make the time for God in our lives. But one thing I've always learned um

13
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.440
along my own spiritual journey and that is that I am forever grateful for the fact that God never

14
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:45.820
takes a vacation from us. And I know we do that sometimes, and today we're going to hear a

15
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.500
little bit more about that as we talk about multiplication, as we dive into one of Jesus's parables

16
00:08:52.500 --> 00:09:01.410
called the lost sheep. And it's really about a sheep that decides to wander off and how that applies

17
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:08.090
in our own life in terms of experiencing a closer relationship with God with Jesus and of course

18
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.720
experiencing multiplication in our lives and so whether you're here in person or watching us online

19
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.490
from around the world, thank you for being with us throughout this week. It was great to see that

20
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.300
even this past week we had people tuning in from as far as Singapore. So it's incredible what

21
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:31.610
happens when you end up online and how we can have an impact truly around the world, People watching

22
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.610
us from places like the Philippines and Romania and other places of Eastern europe that I never

23
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.930
would have thought would be possible, but that's what we're doing these days um through the blessing

24
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:48.690
of the internet and so it can truly bring the message of Jesus to so many. And so thank you for

25
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:55.180
being a part of that and for welcoming us into your lives. I want you to be encouraged today because

26
00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:01.400
God is receiving you just the way you are on the journey that you are on, God is ready to bring you

27
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:10.930
to a higher level. He's really wanting to level you up to a place that he knows that you can be at,

28
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:18.160
not where you are, but where he knows you need to be. And God does that in our lives by bringing to

29
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:25.290
light the very things that he wants to see changed and transformed in us. And so it can get

30
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:31.910
uncomfortable in the presence of God, and we may feel like in those moments that God isn't loving us.

31
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:38.720
But what he's actually doing is that he's changing us for the better. And so that uncomfortable

32
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.010
presence, that you might sense that conviction that might come over you about not doing certain

33
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:51.440
things and stopping some others about making changes in your life. That's just God speaking to you

34
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.760
and telling you if you let this go, I've got something better for you. Can we say amen to that. And

35
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:04.290
so this day, we want to just welcome God into our hearts and into our lives and give him all the

36
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:11.010
opportunity to be able to do a new work in us. And so would you stand with me as we would sing this

37
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:17.790
first song and it's a great song that we can kick things off with and it's called Amazing Love. And

38
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:23.360
we're just gonna sing this song together. Let's do that right now Father. We commit this gathering

39
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.130
to you. We commit our lives to you. We commit all of ourselves and our plans and our goals, our

40
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:36.060
desires and aspirations, our weaknesses and Brokenness, our sins, the things that keep us from you

41
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:43.810
and experiencing are your best for us as well. Lord, I thank you that today is a new day that we can

42
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:50.180
walk with you that we can be truly brought into a deeper and more meaningful relationship with you.

43
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.840
Thank you for the things that you're going to reveal to us and the things that you're going to help

44
00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:01.060
us to better understand about ourselves. And so father today we give you all the glory and honor

45
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:09.120
that you deserve through our savior, Jesus christ in Jesus name. We pray amen, Amen you guys ready

46
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.760
to worship. Well, would you welcome the River's Edge worship team and let's sing this song together

47
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:27.240
began to sing the song tremble from mosaic and just how we can realize how strong the Lord is that

48
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:34.840
he makes the darkness tremble. That that's who we have, fighting for us. That's who we have on our

49
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.300
back. Praise God.

142
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:56.690
Well, we are in this series called multiply and we're gonna continue with that in just a few moments.

143
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.140
But before we do I just wanted to share some quick announcements with you. Well last weekend was

144
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.170
Father's Day and if you were here we had a lot of fun. It was great to see an electric lawnmower

145
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:11.910
race and, and the feasting on Krispy Kreme donuts and all the rest. And those are the kinds of

146
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:18.800
things that just help us bring us together as a community of faith and it just makes the experience

147
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:25.660
a little fun too. And we are so grateful and thankful for the donations that have been made and for

148
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.070
the commitments that have been made. We've been in this campaign called Funding Future and we've

149
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:36.320
been looking for people who would be willing to um just sign up to basically support us on a weekly

150
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.180
bi weekly or monthly basis. And those little cards are available at the giving kiosks and so when

151
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.390
you take a look at that, you can take one home with you think about it, pray about it and then bring

152
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.920
it back the following week and just submit that. And just to say, hey, this is gonna be my

153
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:57.360
commitment to helping out River's Edge. And we've had people put in small amounts and people put in

154
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:02.370
large amounts and all of it matters all of it helps and all of it makes a difference. And so

155
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:08.480
whatever it is that you can do whatever it is that you can make a difference with here, it's greatly

156
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.990
appreciated. And so the four ways that you can also give our obviously online on our website, we

157
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:20.000
have to platforms that you can give through. One is called tidal and the other one is called Canada

158
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.470
helps and there are apps for those as well. So you don't need to necessarily go to the website but

159
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.150
you can find them they're very quickly and you can also download them on your phone and you can

160
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:36.870
become a weekly bi weekly or monthly partner by using one of those platforms as well. So the card is

161
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:42.140
just one way to communicate that but then the way that you can actually accomplish that would be

162
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:47.770
through those apps and then we also have of course the E transfer Which is the best way to give to

163
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:55.600
us because there are no fees, we get to keep 100% of the donation and and we'll be able to talk to

164
00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.240
you in the next few weeks about what that looks like in terms of how you can make those

165
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.730
contributions and also have a benefit from that as well. So those are the ways and then we have this

166
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:15.900
concert that's coming up and this concert is put together by a christian performing group that is a

167
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:23.810
gospel choir called Gira. It's led by Carol Bernard and she has put together people from different

168
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:29.350
communities of faith, including people from our own community of faith and that this concert is

169
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:36.100
going to be happening on july the third and it's going to be on the T. D. Stage and it's a concert

170
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:44.660
that is being put on by Gira at the jazz fest. And we want to encourage you to attend this

171
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.820
performance and there's a lot of people in there that we love and we want to support and encourage

172
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:55.970
and it's gonna be a great concert and it's gonna happen on july the third at the jazz fest. Well

173
00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:02.460
we're encouraging you to stay behind at the after party. And if you haven't filled out a first

174
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:08.080
contact card, we would love for you to do so. And if you could just go to the in full point, pick up

175
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.780
a card, put down your information, that would be a great way for us to be able to get in touch with

176
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.570
you. And if there's anything that you would like to see happen in terms of your next steps, maybe

177
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:23.550
you're looking for a small group. Well we have groups that are starting all the time groups that

178
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:29.250
have been continuing now for quite some time and we would love to see you guys get plugged in. And

179
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:34.520
so if there's a way that we can help you to take that step, we would love to help you with that.

180
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:40.700
Well, it's time for the message that means the kids can be dismissed. If there are any kids here, um

181
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:47.210
then you can go to the annex and someone will help you to check in and just go to your class there

182
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:54.650
and get checked in and parents don't forget to pick them up at the end. So that's good. I'm not

183
00:34:54.650 --> 00:35:01.420
saying that's happened a lot, but it has happened. All right. Let's watch this quick video and we'll

184
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.020
continue with the message called the Lost One drink

185
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.840
series called Multiply. And today we're going to continue that by looking at one of the parables of

186
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:28.470
Jesus and the parable of Jesus that we're going to be focusing on today is called the wander. And we

187
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:37.450
are going to talk about this lost sheep That decided to leave his flock and the supervision of his

188
00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:43.450
Shepherd. And so let's take a look in the scriptures beginning at Luke 15 will begin to read these

189
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:50.860
seven verses together. And so it says that the tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came

190
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:58.120
to listen to Jesus teach. And this made the Pharisees and the teachers of the religious law complain.

191
00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:04.190
And he was the reason why that he was associating with sinful people that he was even eating with

192
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:08.700
them. And this was of course something that they never would have done. So Jesus told them this

193
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:17.440
story that if a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost, then what will he do, won't he leave

194
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:25.740
the 99 others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it and when

195
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:33.580
he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders. And when he arrives, he's going to

196
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:40.060
call together his friends and neighbors. And he's gonna say, rejoice with me because I have found my

197
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:47.990
lost sheep. And in the same way, there is more joy in heaven, over one lost sinner who repents And

198
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:57.460
returns to God, then over 99 others who are righteous and haven't strayed away. It's an interesting

199
00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:05.670
story that Jesus tells and in the theme of multiplication, it seems a little strange because we're

200
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:13.910
not really seeing multiplication in the story, what we're seeing is that the shepherd makes a

201
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:20.790
decision to go after the one. Now, the first thing that we notice is that there is a wanderer in the

202
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:27.880
story, and I think we've all heard this phrase and possibly have repeated it ourselves, but this

203
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:37.440
proverb, let's call it. That is one that says that not everyone who wanders is lost. And the idea

204
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.500
there being that we're explorers at heart that there are things that we want to see, that we may not

205
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:51.270
always have a plan, that we may act spontaneously in this life, that we may decide to go on a

206
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.720
journey without it being mapped out or figured out. But we're going to go on it anyways, we're gonna

207
00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:04.880
end up in a new place in a new country, in a new city, in a new environment. And we may not have

208
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:12.300
everything figured out. Well, the kind of wandering that is happening in this story isn't that kind.

209
00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:22.700
In fact, when the word lost is used in this particular text, it's the same language that we find

210
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:33.250
elsewhere in the scriptures to also illustrate what it looks like to be destroyed, what it looks

211
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:43.360
like to lose everything. And so the urgency that is upon the shepherd is one that makes him realize

212
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:52.740
that The 99 are safer where they are than the one who has wandered off And he's willing to leave the

213
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.540
99 behind.

214
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:05.740
But he must go after the one because if he doesn't, then the one will be lost forever. And what

215
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:12.340
Jesus says is that he looks at this story in this parable that he's telling us to of course,

216
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:19.280
illustrate how important we all are to him, how every person is important to him, that there isn't

217
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.560
anything that he wouldn't do to save us, just like the shepherd would do everything to save that

218
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:35.420
sheep from certain destruction. He doesn't want that sheep's life to be lost. And so he will do

219
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:43.530
whatever it takes, whatever the sacrifice, whatever the journey he will do it because he needs to

220
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:51.200
bring the one back. And I don't know if I always have that urgency. I mean, I've lost things before

221
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:59.730
that I think were important to a point and I looked and and and it was something that may have had a

222
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:07.440
certain value to me. And then once I recognized that it was simply lost? Well, I just well accepted

223
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:15.870
the loss. There's been times where I have had friendships or relationships, or I've been in business

224
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:24.270
and invested and found myself just giving of myself and my resources to something that I was certain

225
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:34.430
would somehow bring back a return. And it did not that was lost. And I accepted that and I moved on.

226
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:44.190
And I come to think about this passage. And I wonder, Lord, did I move on too quickly? I wonder Lord,

227
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:56.490
did I do everything that I could have done? Was that more me accepting the loss? Just because it

228
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:05.410
hurt too much to keep pursuing that? Which was lost. Was it because maybe I didn't have enough faith

229
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:13.940
to believe that it could ever be found that ever it could be brought back that I could once again

230
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:22.780
have it. And maybe he wouldn't look exactly the way that I had lost it. But I didn't trust you

231
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:30.000
enough to even pursue it to the point where I would even believe that it was possible. I think

232
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.930
there's something about this story that reminds us that at some point, not only have we experienced

233
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:46.840
this loss and this wandering away, but we may have done that ourselves. Have you ever gotten lost on

234
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.630
purpose?

235
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.910
Have you ever wandered away intentionally?

236
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:03.590
Did you ever make the decision and the choice to no longer stay where you were, but to be found

237
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:13.090
somewhere and with someone else other than the shepherd, who was watching over you? Did you ever

238
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:22.420
make that decision? Kind of unintentionally? But it was in your heart and the next thing you knew

239
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:31.800
your steps were taking you further and further away until you finally look around and you realize

240
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.810
that you are completely lost

241
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:43.980
and you don't know how to make your way back. Well, if you've ever been on a spiritual journey,

242
00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:53.730
which I'm sure you have been, I know you've experienced this, the sense of not knowing where you are,

243
00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:02.340
the sense of realizing that you don't know how to make your way back. The realization that you made

244
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:08.940
a mistake, but you've wandered so far, you don't ever think you can make it back. I think we've all

245
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:16.580
been there. And what I love about the story is that that doesn't stop the shepherd from going after

246
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:23.030
the sheep anyway. Maybe he would have said, you know, I've got 99, I've lost one, I'm just gonna cut

247
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:30.940
my losses. I'm going to let that one just unfortunately, it's made its choice. It's made its

248
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:38.820
decision, It's gone its way. I'm gonna let it do that. But Jesus doesn't let us get away from him.

249
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:47.100
That's what I love about this story, He doesn't let us get away, You know? And if Jesus is this way

250
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:57.330
he's saying, can you be this way too can you also behave in the manner in which I am revealing

251
00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:05.360
myself to be. If you want to experience multiplication in your life, then I want you to take on this

252
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:15.250
understanding, but also this application. So you can behave in a whole new way. Would you make it

253
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:25.060
your life purpose like it is mine to go after that which wanders and is lost. And if you will be

254
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:35.270
this way, I want you to know that you are walking in my footsteps, that you are behaving like me as

255
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:43.100
the shepherd. And so I don't know what comes to mind when you think of that which has wandered away

256
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:54.810
and is lost. What is it that comes to mind in your life that you may have lost? What is it that you

257
00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:03.060
may feel today? That God is just stirring this up and bringing it back into your mind and into your

258
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:14.190
heart to not leave it lost, but to go after it to pursue it with all of your heart and energy and to

259
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:21.770
make sure that that which has wandered off can be brought back. Because the second thing that we see

260
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:31.090
in the story is that Jesus loves the wander. There is nothing about the wanderer that repels Jesus.

261
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:37.970
In fact, the beginning of the passage that we read, What did we see Jesus doing? That he was deeply

262
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:47.370
criticized for he was spending time with people that the scriptures called notorious sinners. He was

263
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:55.290
spending time with people who, according to the religious leaders were unclean, he found themselves,

264
00:45:55.450 --> 00:46:02.760
they found themselves with Jesus because Jesus was going after every wanderer. In fact, Jesus tells

265
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:09.300
this parable to help everyone understand that there isn't anyone that he isn't willing to go after

266
00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:17.190
that. Even when the church and religious leaders and whenever religious people give up on other

267
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:24.820
people, just like the people that Jesus was sitting at the table with Jesus was saying, I will never

268
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:33.560
give up on them, Every single one of them matters. The reason I'm at this table, the reason I am

269
00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:44.110
drinking and eating with them is because I go after the wanderer that is lost. I love the wonder and

270
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:51.040
they had no love in their hearts for the wanderer. And sometimes I have felt like I was not loved,

271
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:57.560
not loved in the environment, I was in not loved with the partners. I may have had not loved by the

272
00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:05.190
friendships that I assumed were there and loyal, not loved by whoever it was that was in my life who

273
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:11.760
I expected to sacrifice to the same level that I was willing to sacrifice. And that's one of the

274
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:18.600
hardest things in life is when you are unequally yoked with someone who doesn't want the same thing,

275
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:25.930
doesn't believe the same thing, doesn't pursue the same thing, doesn't want to put all of the

276
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:35.300
sacrifices in it the way that you would expect. And sometimes in those moments we make the decision,

277
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:46.450
I will no longer love this. Wonder, think about it, we make that decision. I will no longer love

278
00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:53.770
this wander. But even when we have made that decision, here's the beautiful part, Jesus saying, I

279
00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.910
have never stopped loving them.

280
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:04.820
And if we understand God at the heart of Jesus and we understand the principles of multiplication,

281
00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:11.550
then we will understand this. That even when we have given up and have walked away, that Jesus never

282
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:20.680
does. And I'm glad for that, because sometimes we're just at the end of our strength at the end of

283
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:26.210
our faith, we're at the end of our ability to do anything more. We really are. We reach a point

284
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:32.100
where we sometimes just take the person, the situation, the circumstance, and we just say, Lord, I

285
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:38.520
give it to you because there's nothing more that I can do and that is not the wrong thing. But what

286
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:44.190
have you done when you've given it back to God? What have you done when you've put it in his hands?

287
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:53.520
Haven't you kept praying for them? Don't you keep bringing them before the Lord, Even though, you

288
00:48:53.520 --> 00:49:00.810
know, you cannot walk with them. And even though you can no longer pursue them, you can still love

289
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:07.950
them by praying for them. Can we say amen to that? So sometimes you reach a limit in terms of what

290
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:13.730
your capacity is or what their willingness is, even on the other person's behalf. Sometimes it has

291
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:18.600
nothing to do with you. It's they who have walked away from you. It is they who have made the

292
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:28.240
decision to just wander. But God is saying I want you to love them anyways. I want you to pray for

293
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:37.310
them anyways. And we will experience multiplication in our lives when we understand that, Jesus will

294
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:45.470
always love the wonder and I have to just bring that to God and pray and say God, I am struggling to

295
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:52.430
love the wanderer today that is in my life. But I know this you love them more than anyone. And if I

296
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.900
can't go after them and I can't find them and if I can't rescue them and if I can't bring them back,

297
00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:03.690
I know that you can because you are the great shepherd. Can we say amen to that. And so when we've

298
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:08.110
reached our end, when we've reached our limits, when we have our limitations when there are

299
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:16.610
boundaries around us that we can't do anything about, I assure you that Jesus does not have them and

300
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:23.610
he can still reach them wherever they are. And the third thing that we notice is that this wander is

301
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:31.150
completely by themselves. They are a loan wander. In fact. And all three parables that we see in the

302
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:36.280
gospel of luke, whether it be the lost sheep, the lost coin or even the lost son, we see that this

303
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:43.270
person is on their own. And I think that when you're wandering, when you're far from God, it's

304
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:51.400
really you're the most vulnerable and you are very far from the protection that God has to offer you

305
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:59.100
the peace, the prosperity, everything that comes with being under his care and this loan wanderer is

306
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:08.610
so vulnerable and Jesus knows this and because he knows the vulnerability that is in this lone

307
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:20.100
wanderer's life, he's going to do everything he possibly can to go after that wonder himself. And so

308
00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:26.410
whenever we look at our lives and we feel like we're alone or we look at someone and we see that

309
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:34.720
they're alone and they're wandering. Can you think of Jesus going after them? Can you picture and

310
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:43.190
pray, Jesus going and being the shepherd who goes and finds them because he won't leave them alone.

311
00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:52.390
He won't let that happen. He will leave the 99 to go after the one. And that may sound like a huge

312
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:59.990
risk on Jesus part or maybe even carelessness Or even a lack of care and concern for the '99. But

313
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:07.350
that's not what this parable is about What it is about. Isen't that God is worried about the 99 who

314
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:12.150
were there, just like he isn't worried about the coins that haven't been lost and just like he isn't

315
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:20.430
worried about the son who stays home. It's that when something is lost, you have to make sure it

316
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:28.870
gets found. You have to do everything in your power to make sure that that which is lost is found.

317
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:35.730
You have to have that passion and that purpose in life. You want to experience multiplication.

318
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:43.270
Here's how it's gonna happen. You have to believe that that which is lost can be found.

319
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:50.500
There's a lot of people who have given up on that. So they don't experience multiplication because

320
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.670
what they see is that what is lost is lost. I have to now move on and listen to this and find

321
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.770
something else that is new.

322
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:09.390
I have to replace what is lost and put my efforts there because that's the only way that God is

323
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:16.630
gonna multiply. But God shows us that one of the principles of multiplication is that we can pray

324
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:26.420
back that which is lost to be found. That that which is lost can be brought back to us. And we don't

325
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:31.500
have to accept their choice. Their decision. We don't have to believe that they're wandering will

326
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:37.890
just simply lead to destruction. We don't have to just give in and give up and just resign to the

327
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:43.880
fact that there's nothing more that we can do. We can believe that that which is lost can be found

328
00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:52.710
because that is the principle of multiplication that Jesus is telling us through this story. And

329
00:53:52.710 --> 00:54:02.520
once we see Jesus who finds as the shepherd the lost and wandering sheep. We see that that cheap is

330
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:12.100
rescued. Jesus rescues it. Have you ever been rescued? I remember one time, I was in Jamaica with my

331
00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:18.340
wife and we were on our honeymoon and it was just like a great time and I was at this part of the

332
00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:23.620
island and there was this huge restaurant and and it had a massive slide that went right into the

333
00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:31.260
ocean. I looked at that, I said, I want to do that. And my wife was like, you're crazy, like number one,

334
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:38.380
you are not a good swimmer, number two, you are not a good swimmer. Like there' s... And the water was

335
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:45.530
like very rough that day. It was the ocean. And so the slide was quite high, it was quite long and

336
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:51.750
most of the people that were, you know, going down that slide where uh drunk, let's be completely

337
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:59.750
clear on what was happening there. And there was a bunch of guys, boys and men who were under the

338
00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:06.070
slide, kind of like hanging onto the posts and they would go out every once in a while and have to

339
00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:14.400
rescue someone and literally like drag them back to shore. And, and so I saw that and I said, okay,

340
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:21.600
I feel, I feel confident, I feel confident, I feel good. There's people there. You know, if I get

341
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.490
into any kind of trouble that someone's going to come out, swim up to me and help me. I was like

342
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:31.280
awesome, I'm gonna do this, went up to the slide. So happy up there, looking down beautiful day, the

343
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:37.000
ocean. The slide was like, wow, it's so big. I was like I'm gonna do it, I went down, I slipped and

344
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:46.720
went right into the ocean and the moment I landed I knew I regretted it, I regretted it. It was the

345
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:52.440
current was so much stronger than I had imagined. I'd gotten to the top, I was struggling to swim

346
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:58.060
against the current, I couldn't get back to shore and now all of a sudden my poor swimming skills

347
00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:04.090
were like staring me in the face and I really kept looking at the guys and I was signaling like

348
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:11.300
rescue me, rescue me. And at this point the ocean had gotten so dangerous that even the guys who

349
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:19.240
were clinging to the poles were like we are not going out there. And and I realized that after

350
00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:27.050
waving for what felt like minutes which were literally seconds and no one coming to me, I realized

351
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:35.280
that I was on my own. I was like Jesus, I'm about to die on my honeymoon. I said help me to give

352
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:42.090
back the shore and all of a sudden, I don't know, a burst of strength and just determination. Just,

353
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:50.490
I don't know just the funeral costs in my mind. I was just swimming and and I was just like swimming,

354
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:55.570
swimming, swimming. I finally get to the columns where the, where the boys were and the first thing

355
00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:05.160
out of my mouth was you guys like me out there to die. I have felt so abandoned, You know, I was

356
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:12.630
lost at sea. No one cared except my poor wife was like cringing at every moment. And and and as I

357
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:20.430
got back there, you could see that they had like zero concern. Like no, no compassion. You could

358
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:29.190
tell that people had died like this before that they had become calloused by the fact that this

359
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:36.390
wouldn't be the first stupid white man who drowned in this in this ocean. You know. And and sure

360
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:44.920
enough there I was, you know, convinced that I was going to have a great experience but then found

361
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:52.970
myself to be lost. And when I was out there by myself, the only person I could reach out to was God,

362
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:59.480
I really had no one who was coming to help me. And there were times when guys, it's gonna feel like

363
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:10.030
and it's not gonna be just a feeling, it's gonna be for real. No one is going to come for you. No

364
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:16.070
one's gonna come knock at your door, no one's gonna text you, no one's gonna call you, no one's gonna

365
00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:21.460
come visit you, no one's gonna check up on you. No one's gonna love you and have the concern that

366
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:26.880
you would expect them to have. But in that moment when you are lost because you have wandered too

367
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.250
far, Jesus is still there.

368
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:38.350
And in the same way that he helped me get back to shore, he will help you because Jesus does this

369
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:47.250
over and over again. He comes to our rescue. Can we say amen to that, Jesus comes to our rescue, He

370
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:54.240
comes to our rescue, whatever the situation, whatever the circumstances, Jesus comes to our rescue

371
00:58:54.270 --> 00:59:02.150
and then when he comes and he rescues us, oh man! When I made it back upstairs to the restaurant, I

372
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:09.130
mean the best feeling in my life was just sitting in that chair and having a, having a margarita, I

373
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:19.550
just like that moment was just blessed. I almost died and now I'm able to just rest and there's this

374
00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:26.630
sense of God, thank you that you are always with me. You know what the shepherd does. He goes and he

375
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:32.350
takes the sheep and he doesn't say, okay, now follow me back or walk ahead of me and I'm going to

376
00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:39.740
show you what it is to get back home. He picks it up and he puts it on his shoulders because when

377
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:47.130
something has been rescued, let me tell you this with such clarity and understanding, having gone

378
00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:54.610
through it and having done this for others before you have to understand that this is not a time for

379
00:59:54.610 --> 01:00:03.080
them to understand the lesson of having wandered away. This is not the time for you to teach for you

380
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:11.140
to preach, this is not the time for you to do anything other than to provide safety for them to rest.

381
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:19.190
And that's what Jesus does. He takes that. She puts it on his shoulders and he gives it the rest

382
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:25.980
that it needs. And he carries it all the way back. And I think of the times where I know I needed

383
01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:31.900
that rest where Jesus had rescued me, I wasn't ready for anything in that moment. I knew I was lost,

384
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:39.080
I knew I had wandered away too far. I'm already broken. Don't break me more than how I already feel.

385
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:47.920
I get it. I am a loser. I know that in that moment. I don't need to hear how many more ways you can

386
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:56.730
describe what a loser I am. What I need to know in this moment is that I am I safe with you. Have I

387
01:00:56.730 --> 01:01:07.500
truly been found? Can I now rest? And I believe that we are so bad at this. We don't know how to

388
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:15.560
give people rest. We don't know how to bring them back to a place where they can feel strong again

389
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:23.010
and be right again and be good again to do what needs to happen after this. But I assure you that

390
01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:30.730
Jesus isn't just interested in giving us rest. He's interested in restoration Because where Jesus

391
01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:39.130
brings the sheep back, is with the other 99 and he puts him back in the pen where he can now have

392
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:47.250
his authority established over that sheep again, where he can love it, protect it, provide for it so

393
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:53.030
that he could now have the peace that it needs to be able to rest and recover and be fully restored.

394
01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:00.820
God isn't just interested in pointing out how we are lost. He's interested in making sure we get

395
01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:10.120
found. He wants us to be the same way when we see something that is lost, he wants his Children, his

396
01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.850
sons and daughters, he wants his people to start thinking this is a situation where that which is

397
01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:24.920
lost can be found, this is not about a moment where this is just a subtraction, this is not another

398
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:31.480
division moment. What this is is an opportunity for multiplication and Lord, that's how I'm gonna

399
01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.940
see it. That's how I'm gonna pray, that's how I'm gonna live. And when I hear about that, which is

400
01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:45.860
lost. The first thing that I am gonna say isn't Yeah, yeah, this is definitely lost. I'm gonna say

401
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:56.070
no, this can be found, this can be found. This is an opportunity not for it to say lost. This is an

402
01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.070
opportunity for it to be found. And I don't know when you're gonna do it, I don't know how you're

403
01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:08.570
gonna do it, but I am gonna believe that whatever is lost, it can be found because with Jesus

404
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:15.770
nothing is lost. Can we say amen to that. I just want to end there with this and I hope this

405
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:20.900
encourages you and blesses you guys on your spiritual journey today in making the effort to be here

406
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:30.880
and to be able to understand what it means to experience what Jesus is teaching. He wants us to see

407
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:36.790
that which is lost can always be found. God bless you. Would you stand with me, Thank you for that,

408
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:44.270
I appreciate it. And uh we have a great opportunity to pray right now and to think about the things

409
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:49.840
that we may have lost things that are lost things that we believe that Jesus has the power and the

410
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:56.090
authority to make found again. Can we take this moment right now as we would pray as the band would

411
01:03:56.090 --> 01:04:02.840
join us back on stage, would you take this moment in your mind and in your heart and begin to

412
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:13.980
exercise your faith and begin to pray and ask God to make clear to you how that which is lost can be

413
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:22.330
found how you can experience multiplication again in your life in Jesus name. We pray father that we

414
01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:28.360
would experience the truth of Your word, that we would be people who would hear it and would believe

415
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:35.430
it, that we would put this into practice, that we would trust you, that we would come before you and

416
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:44.330
that we would bring that which is lost before your very eyes and say, Lord intervene and in this

417
01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:51.580
moment, take that which is lost in my life and make it found Lord. I thank you that this is what you

418
01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:59.580
have taught us, what you have revealed to us and what you desire us to put into practice today. And

419
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:07.190
we ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So just keep thinking about this. Keep praying about this in

420
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:14.500
your life and I know that you will be blessed. Well, there's this song that we want to sing at the

421
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.990
conclusion of this gathering and I want to hang out with you for a few moments at the after party.

422
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:24.600
So can you just stick around and just introduce yourselves if you haven't done so yet. And I would

423
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.600
love to be able to say hi to you as well. So let's sing this song together. Could you welcome the
