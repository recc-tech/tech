00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:19.570
genius or The Genius of Power, sorry. And it's about how we can use our power to serve others, which

2
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:26.670
is so important. A little reminder that River's Edge is a community where you belong before you

3
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:34.800
believe this is a community where you can come and be accepted and inspired and encouraged and we

4
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.980
want you just to be a part of what we're doing here. It is okay not to be okay. We're all a little

5
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:50.780
messy and God accepts us exactly where we are. So please everybody. Let's stand up. Let's prepare

6
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.190
our hearts to worship and we'll join our team for our first song called heartbeat.

7
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.290
Let's clap our hands. Worship God this morning, Hallelujah.

81
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.090
Amazing.

82
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.200
So a few announcements before we continue with the gathering. First of all, a little bit of a praise

83
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:06.910
report our community kitchen is coming alive. So we're so thankful for the teams that showed up

84
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:14.050
friday and saturday to start cleaning out downstairs so we can start serving the community around us.

85
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.510
I think we have a few photos here. So let's give a round of applause for the teams of volunteers

86
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.220
that are doing this. Good work.

87
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:34.790
Great, excellent. Um just a reminder. There are no kids programming um during the month of august we

88
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:41.930
thank our teachers, we are so thankful for the work that they do. We've given them a little bit of a

89
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:47.180
break, they will be back. But for the month of august there are no kids programming. If you need

90
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:53.130
supplies for your kids that are here, please ask and we will help you out with that um important

91
00:21:53.130 --> 00:22:01.790
announcement again. Um Patty will be starting a new belong group here on Wednesdays. So after the

92
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:06.620
gathering, you can meet patty at the back and inquire about that. If you're not part of a belong

93
00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.910
group, we strongly encourage it for connection within the community. So Patti, you want to just wave

94
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:23.040
maybe so you can meet her at the back after the service. There are four ways to give here the things

95
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.380
that we do at River's Edge. We can't do without you and that's you know, developing our community

96
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:37.130
and again, outreach outside of our community. Any offering is accepted and appreciated. We have four

97
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:43.030
ways. Please choose the way that is most convenient for you and give whatever is compelled on your

98
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:50.790
own heart. And finally, again, there's an after party after the service. Come and meet us. Come and

99
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:56.800
meet the team. Don't be shy. We want to know who you are, uh, say hi to someone that you don't know

100
00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:02.250
this is a community and we want everyone to be as connected as possible. So let's welcome Pastor

101
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.740
Lorenzo as we continue with the service.

102
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.680
So good to be with you and so glad that you could be with us together here in this space and what a

103
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:41.700
joy it is for us to be able to gather as a community of faith and to be on this journey together. I

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.800
really wanna thank Kathleen and her team for the great work that they've been doing in relaunching

105
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:51.770

106
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:57.350
Um, even our after party team at the cafe is going to be taking a break for the next couple of

107
00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:02.410
Sundays. We want to give them a break as well. And then they'll be back in the first week of

118
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:14.260
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but has it been at least eight years that I haven't seen you guys?

119
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:22.130
I'm good eh, I remembered your name, I don't know all those kids, you didn't have all those when I last

120
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:29.460
saw you. So you guys have been busy. Well, welcome. We're so glad that you're with us. It's amazing.

121
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:34.720
Well we are in this series called The Genius of Jesus and what we're talking about today is the

122
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:40.800
genius of power and one of the most beautiful passages in scripture is probably one of the saddest,

123
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:48.350
because it reminds us of how power can be abused, but also used correctly at the same time. In fact,

124
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:55.720
in John Chapter 18, I want us to read this passage and it's found in chapter four, verse four to

125
00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:00.090
verse 11, We're gonna read it together. Okay, It's right here on the screens and you can follow

126
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:06.950
along. It says that Jesus fully realized all that was going to happen to him. So he stepped forward

127
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:17.880
to meet them and he says, who are you looking for, Jesus the Nazarene, they replied. And then Jesus

128
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:26.800
answers, I am he and judas who betrayed him was standing right with them. And then in verse six, it

129
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:34.560
says, as Jesus said, I am, he hears an important part in this whole story. Is that as he says, these

130
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:44.710
words, I am he. They all drew back and they fell to the ground. And then in verse seven, once more,

131
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:53.480
he asked them, who are you looking for? And again they replied, Jesus the Nazarene. And then in

132
00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:00.430
verse eight, I told you that I am, he, Jesus said. And since I am the one that you want let these

133
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:11.670
others go and he did this to fulfill his own statement, I did not lose a single one of those that

134
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:23.160
you have given me. And then Simon Peter does something completely unexpected. He drew a sword and he

135
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:32.700
slashed off the right ear of Malkoc, who was the high priest's slave, but Jesus said to Peter put

136
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:41.970
your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink from the cup of suffering that the father has

137
00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:53.900
given me? And in this story, we see two very different events regarding power. Of course there is

138
00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:04.280
this misuse of power, not just personal, but also collective. We see the misuse of power by the

139
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:15.850
sanhedrin that is going out to arrest Jesus on false charges. And there we see an abuse of power. We

140
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:26.440
also see an abuse of personal power in where judas is betraying Jesus, Where he has the right and

141
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:34.740
the ability to remain faithful and loyal. And the expectation is that he is one of the 12 who has

142
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:45.150
along with the others learned what it means to sacrifice in light of all that God is showing and

143
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:55.760
teaching and revealing them on their journey in being disciples of Jesus. And so the opportunity to

144
00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:06.720
betray Jesus didn't come from outside the group. It came from within his core, didn't come from the

145
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:17.380
crowd. And it didn't come from those that may have had a different agenda, but it came from someone

146
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:26.900
who was disappointed with the way that Jesus was not using his power. See sometimes the

147
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:33.830
disappointment that we have in our lives is because we see an all powerful God. We see an all

148
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:42.890
powerful Jesus and Jesus does not use his power? The way that we expect him to in our lives

149
00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:50.540
personally, we have been disappointed, not just with the inaction, but sometimes with the long

150
00:29:50.540 --> 00:30:02.460
delays that God has taken in giving us the time to ponder and to reflect and to become anxious and

151
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:11.220
to worry to become frustrated and disgruntled and maybe even have such anger and disdain that we may

152
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:18.500
even walk away from God. And I want you to understand that this is what would have happened in the

153
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:29.880
life of someone like judas, where his disappointment regarding his expectations in wanting to see a

154
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:43.170
powerful Jesus remove their oppressors and establish his kingdom in an earthly manner that judas

155
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:53.080
just had enough and he betrayed Jesus and abused his own personal power in doing so. This is

156
00:30:53.080 --> 00:31:04.710
something that if we are reflective enough and transparent enough, we can sometimes pinpoint in our

157
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:15.800
own lives. You see the genius of Jesus is not that he was powerless, but he was always powerful, but

158
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:24.190
he made decisions in how to use that power and what he does is that he teaches us what that looks

159
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:33.030
like when we are being abused when when that power is being misused, When everything inside of us is

160
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:42.040
telling us to do something that will betray a higher standard and principle that God has given us.

161
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:51.260
Instead. You see the contrast of real power and real powerlessness is actually seen in the story. We

162
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:58.710
see real power in Jesus when he says the words I am and when he says those words, the words that

163
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:10.360
were only spoken by the creator, that everyone who was present falls back under the power of Jesus

164
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:20.140
with him not doing anything violent, but just speaking the words I am there. We see that in a moment

165
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:28.340
in which Jesus looks the most powerless, he is revealing that this is a moment in which he is not

166
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:35.970
powerless, but he is the most powerful where he is accepting what is about to happen. And in that

167
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:45.160
moment he says, I am going to let everyone know that I am willingly laying my life down. But before

168
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:50.230
I lay my life down, you're all going to experience the ground for a few seconds

169
00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:03.130
so that you know that I could do something, but I'm choosing not to, can we say amen to that, I

170
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.850
could do something, I could take you all out here in this garden,

171
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:19.070
Not a single one of you would be able to put your hand on me if I didn't let it. So I'm gonna show

172
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:28.710
you my power, but I'm not gonna lay a hand on any of you, I'm gonna let you take me Because this has

173
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:37.160
been the plan on a lot. And so we see Jesus who is willingly giving his life, He's willingly

174
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:44.450
emptying himself of his power in a sense, like submitting in a way that we would never expect. We

175
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:49.940
would want Jesus to display his power in this moment. So everyone would believe there would be no

176
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:59.060
doubt in anyone's mind, but you see the sacrifice on the cross is far too important for the power to

177
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:09.150
be misused in the moment. That is in the garden right now. And then we see what powerlessness looks

178
00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:16.730
like instead. And we see that not just the by the way that they come to arrest him and they're

179
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:23.500
abusing their power and or judas and how he abuses his own personal power and betrays him and

180
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:29.110
becomes a traitor. But we see powerlessness with peter,

181
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:46.100
we see that he takes a sword and he decides that he is going to show off his skill and he goes up

182
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:56.030
against the high priest and swings and gets the servant instead. Like it's a total miss. And that's

183
00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.000
what happens when fishermen handle weapons.

184
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:13.640
So he takes the sword and misses the high priest and hits the servant who loses an ear. And it

185
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:20.010
wasn't like he was like trying to prove a point where he goes, I'm gonna take off the right ear

186
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:29.300
first And the next one coming off is the left one. No, it was like a disaster. He totally misses in

187
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.160
every sense of the word. And in that moment, Jesus just looks at him and says, would you put that

188
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:40.630
away like, like, like a like a father to a son, what are you doing?

189
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:51.840
You're gonna hurt yourself, You already hurt one guy, you're about to hurt yourself. And so then he

190
00:35:51.840 --> 00:36:00.590
goes down, he picks up the ear and he puts it back on the servants head and he heals them. And and

191
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.410
for the second time we see power

192
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:14.450
even in the midst of an abuse of power. And in that moment we are kind of confused because we're

193
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:23.470
wondering why would Jesus be upset with Peter when all he was doing was trying to defend his savior.

194
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:32.260
But the truth is is that we act powerful When we feel powerless.

195
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:46.910
When we are powerless. It is then that we try to exert power. It is then that we raise our voice. It

196
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:55.540
is then that we raise our hands. It is then that we try to take things by force instead of winning

197
00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:08.710
them by divine right or love. It is when we are powerless and feel this way that we exert ourselves

198
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:20.330
and demand to be seen as powerful. But in reality, all we are doing is proclaiming our powerlessness.

199
00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:32.980
There is no real power in what Peter is doing. There is no real power in us when we do not follow

200
00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:44.190
after the pattern of Jesus, but instead follow after the pattern of our own desire and flesh that

201
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:54.510
leads us into believing and deceiving ourselves and possibly even others that we are powerful when

202
00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:05.930
we are not in the story, we see that we can actually stand in our power and never actually use it

203
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:15.660
and that's what Jesus does. The genius of the power that Jesus reveals and tells us what to do is

204
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:24.850
that we can stand in the power that he has given us and not use it. We can have this power through

205
00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:33.950
the very presence of God in our lives. We have this power with us always, because always with us is

206
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:41.800
the power which is Jesus, the Holy Spirit has taken the name and the form of the presence of God in

207
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:48.740
all of us, that power is always with us. And when we stand on the power of his word and when we

208
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:57.620
stand on the power of his presence, we experience the power of God like no one else can and we don't

209
00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:05.750
need to go walking around this world believing that we are powerless telling others that we have

210
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:18.620
things like happening to us and we have no control over it, People speaking to us in a certain

211
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:26.160
manner. And then we just say, well that's the way I'm gonna have to speak back or striking out in

212
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:36.010
violence. And then we say things like, well they struck first so now I can defend myself and we do

213
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:45.490
these things because in that moment we have not understood true power and how God wants us to

214
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:55.390
exercise that power, how he doesn't want us to ever live our life saying I didn't have a choice when

215
00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:03.330
there was always a choice, he doesn't want us to think for a moment that we are powerless, Even in

216
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:08.910
the moments where we feel like we truly are, even in those moments when everything is stacked

217
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:15.960
against us, the odds are so great that we cannot even fathom victory. That there is no way that we

218
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:22.370
can imagine that we could ever defeat the powers that be in that moment. We need to stand in the

219
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:30.620
power that is Jesus Christ. When we stand in that power, there is never a moment for his followers

220
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:38.550
to ever believe, even for a fleeting moment that they are powerless because God is that power in us.

221
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:48.650
And what Jesus teaches in this story is that there is a way for us to reveal humility in power and

222
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:58.270
to understand that the level of the power we have is actually seen best when we don't use it when

223
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:07.200
you and I talk about humility humility isn't expressed in powerlessness and we see a lot of people

224
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:14.020
put their head down and say sorry and apologize and back away from whoever is more aggressive and in

225
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:19.410
that moment we look at that person and say that's a humble person. No, no humility is when you stand

226
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:28.540
in power and you don't use it, humility is when you could do something and you make the decision not

227
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:39.190
to humility is you walk away knowing that if you engaged things would get much worse. It's knowing

228
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:46.170
that you could do something but you are choosing not to that humility and when we think about

229
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:53.070
humility, it leads us to an understanding of then what is servant hood, you see in the person of

230
00:41:53.070 --> 00:42:00.430
Jesus, we understand servant hood so much more clearly because servant hood is practice when we are

231
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:09.050
powerful, not when we are powerless, when we see Jesus kneeling down and washing his disciples feet,

232
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:17.690
he's saying, I don't have to do this, but I do it because this is what servant hood is, I serve not

233
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:27.400
because I have to, but because I must, that is what it looks like to serve. That's what it looks

234
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:34.820
like to be humble, that's what it looks like to understand power and its usage in our everyday lives,

235
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:41.800
that's what it looks like to be like, Jesus and what Jesus does is that he teaches us these things,

236
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:51.350
I want us to understand today, that Jesus taught us how to live with the misuse of power rather than

237
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.590
to overthrow it.

238
00:42:55.050 --> 00:43:00.670
Now, I know what this looks like and I know what it sounds like and I know especially what it feels

239
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:12.030
like because we we understand overthrowing injustice is exactly the way the hebrews understood it in

240
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:22.220
that time. It's the reason why jews still to this day, have a really hard time in accepting Jesus as

241
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:33.410
the messiah because they still imagined and envisioned a Jesus who had come to overthrow, but Jesus

242
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:42.960
comes to do something different, he comes to overthrow, not the regimes of this world, but the realm

243
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:52.730
of satan instead see by taking care of the realm of satan, he can take care of every other realm

244
00:43:52.740 --> 00:44:00.740
that is called a kingdom in this world. And what Jesus does is that he goes to the source of what is

245
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:06.670
the real issue, because we all know and we've seen this in the course of history that you can

246
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:15.380
overthrow a dictator and another one just takes his place. We can have revolution and things go back

247
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:24.790
to being the same over and over again. We will see men and women abuse their power, but what we want

248
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:33.730
is a god who teaches us how to live in the midst of people who are abusing that power and instead of

249
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:41.940
that controlling us that we can control ourselves in the midst of that and not succumb to the same

250
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:50.840
patterns of this world, but live above them and show a different way of being, of living, of

251
00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.470
experiencing the power that Jesus is

252
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:03.720
And it's so easy for us to get caught up in to what this looks like. That's why in Matthew Chapter

253
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:15.770
five, it says this in verses 38 2 42, you have heard the law that says that punishment must match

254
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:25.240
the injury and then he says there was an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth and it's a phrase,

255
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:30.980
let's let's be honest, we we don't may not know a lot of scripture, but everybody knows this one,

256
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:38.100
this one is like known around the world doesn't matter what faith everybody lives by this standard

257
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:47.640
and I for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. And then Jesus says, but I say to you, do not resist an evil

258
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:56.770
person and then he says, if someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also and if

259
00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:03.750
you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, then I want you to give your quote too. And

260
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:12.020
if a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile, then go ahead And carry it for two miles.

261
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:22.000
Give to those who ask and don't turn away from those who want to borrow. These are hard words, right?

262
00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:30.120
And when Jesus teaches this in Matthew Chapter five, there is a series of teachings that he gives

263
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:39.670
that when the crowd was in the multiple thousands, it dwindled down to just a few because they heard

264
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:47.750
these words and they said who could possibly do this? And what Jesus does is that he shows us what

265
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:55.890
it looks like, to not allow for the abuse of power to change us,

266
00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.970
he doesn't want people abusing power to change our character,

267
00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:19.570
to give up our principles, to forget our values, to forget that even in the moments in which we are

268
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:29.870
surrounded by the abuse and the misuse of power that in those moments he's saying, I want you to

269
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:39.930
understand you're still in control and I will show you how to be powerful, I will reveal to you what

270
00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:49.420
it looks like to have power. And the genius of Jesus is that he takes what happened in the garden of

271
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:59.460
Gethsemane later on in his life, but he gives us a glimpse of it in this teaching and then he shows

272
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:04.930
us what it looks like, practically, because up until this moment, Jesus was never really tested,

273
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:10.060
like he would be in the garden. There was a moment when they tried to kill him and throw him over a

274
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:15.780
cliff and he just walked right through them and he proved that even in the moments in which people

275
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:21.780
wanted to take his life, they can't because God's got a plan and God will only take his life when

276
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:28.710
Jesus voluntarily gives it up. And in the garden of Gethsemane, he talks about that cup and he says

277
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:36.080
make it pass, Is there another way, is there another plan? And and and in that process of

278
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:42.720
understanding God's plan and accepting it, that there is no other way other than the cross, Jesus

279
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:50.130
then stands up in the power and the certain tude of what God has showed him and revealed him that

280
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:57.540
when the enemy comes, he is able to just stand in that power and what God does is that he builds us

281
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:04.900
up you and I so that we live out that power every day of our lives. So it doesn't matter who comes

282
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:14.090
to us and what they ask of us, what they want to take from us. Because the truth is that no one can

283
00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:23.070
take anything away from you, since you have already given it all away, they cannot take from you

284
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:31.240
what you have given. And so Jesus says, when someone comes and tells you that they want to strike

285
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:38.590
you, you give them your other cheek because in that misuse of power, in that abuse of power, you are

286
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:47.840
going to show them that you are still powerful, that you will not become like them when they come

287
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:55.030
and they want to sue you, you say you want to take this from me, Take this too, because everything

288
00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:03.430
already belongs to God. There is nothing you can take from me that God cannot give me and multiplied

289
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.910
Later on, there is nothing you can do.

290
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:15.920
And if you're gonna abuse your power and you're gonna look at your horse and say your horse is tired

291
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:21.630
and you're gonna take the load that's on that horse and you're gonna put it on me and you're gonna

292
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:28.330
force it according to roman law to walk a mile and carry your horses load, I will do it. And then

293
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:35.890
when you say it's fine hebrew, you can put that pack back on my horse, I'm gonna say I'm gonna walk

294
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:48.030
another mile, I'm good because you cannot abuse power against someone who is powerful. I'm powerful

295
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:55.900
in my mind, I'm powerful in my spirit. I am powerful in my body. I am powerful in my life. And Jesus

296
00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.610
saying, it doesn't matter what the world does, it doesn't matter what it says, Doesn't matter what

297
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:05.950
it tries to take away. It doesn't matter how it behaves what it does and doesn't do against you and

298
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:11.940
your loved ones. You can stand in the power that I have given you because that power will make you

299
00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:22.240
more than a conqueror. In Christ Jesus. I believe in that power, do you? I wanna live that power. I

300
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:29.540
want to take the teaching that Jesus has given us and I want to make it real in every way in my life,

301
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:40.230
Jesus teaches us how to use our power for good. He shows us how power looks like when we do good,

302
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:49.080
even when people mean it for evil, even when people come against us and try to hurt us and take away

303
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:58.150
from us and try to destroy us, we can still show power and do good. He's saying, when someone wants

304
00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:04.320
to hurt you, Show good, when they want to take something from you, show good. When they want to

305
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:11.090
abuse their power and the law against you, show good. You don't worry about any of that. I've got

306
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:20.200
you, I'm in you, I'm with you. You are not powerless. You are powerful. Amen, God bless you. I'm

307
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:31.250
going to stop there. Lord bless you. Mhm. So we're gonna pray father, thank you for everything

309
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:41.560
have that within us and and all that you have revealed Lord and all that. You're going to show us in

310
00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:48.870
our everyday lives how you're going to continue to increase your power in us and how we can do good

311
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:55.350
with that power in this world. Thank you for that And we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Would
