1
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:57.980
so glad to be able to welcome you in person here at River's Edge. It's wonderful to be able to be in

2
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.210
the last message in this series called the genius of Jesus and today we're gonna be talking about

3
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:10.100
the genius of beautiful, We're gonna be looking at different passages of scripture that are going to

4
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:19.030
encourage us to understand how tragedy can be turned into beauty. Today, I want to welcome you as

5
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:26.770
you are because that's the way that God welcomes you. He knows how each of us. Is that a different

6
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:33.560
place in our spiritual journey and each and every one of us needs to be welcomed into his presence

7
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.820
so that we can experience the transformation that he has in store for us and that means we can be

8
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:51.380
okay to not be okay. It means that we can belong even before we believe it means that God can lead

9
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:59.210
us to a place that is so much better than where we are because there is so much that he wants to do

10
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:06.560
for each and every one of us to show us what it means to truly be fully human and fully alive. And

11
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.330
so today we are going to begin this gathering by worshiping God together. We're gonna sing a few

12
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:19.740
songs that are going to inspire us and and hopefully even teach us the scriptures that we need to be

13
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.420
able to worship him in every season of our life. And so today I invite you to stand with me as we

14
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:34.280
would begin this gathering by opening in prayer and asking God to receive our worship, but also to

15
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:42.230
inspire us to worship him in all phases of our life. And so father, as we surrender to you in this

16
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:49.170
moment, we thank you that we can use this opportunity to sing our praises and worship to you. Help

17
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:56.450
us Lord to go from a place where we are hurting to a place where we can experience healing. A place

18
00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:05.810
where we are living tragedy and experience beauty instead. And we ask this in Jesus name, Amen. Amen

19
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.440
ready to worship together. Let's sing this first song. God bless you.

thanks everyone, well you may be seated, thank you worship team and as we find ourselves in this

89
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.560
part of the service, I just wanted to share with you a few announcements. The first is again an

90
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:45.890
update with regards to our community kitchen, so things have been moving so quickly behind the

91
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:55.440
scenes are first distribution is already planned for this in two weeks time, basically on the 19th

92
00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:00.060
on the 18th, excuse me after the gathering, so we have meals that have been prepared and they're

93
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:06.780
going to be distributed on that day and we're gonna just gauge the level of need and participation

94
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:12.660
from that Sunday and then get ready for what's gonna be happening during the week and so this is a

95
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:20.250
very important uh Sunday in which the community kitchen is, is relaunching and for those of you who

96
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:28.300
have contact with those who were once a part of our community kitchen ministry as well as our guests,

97
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:34.690
please help us spread the word that community kitchen is back and that's an exciting thing for us.

98
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:47.390
Uh they'll be working on the commercial fridge um today and tomorrow, getting that set up and ready

99
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:53.710
to start receiving food and there's gonna be a bin that's going to be provided in the main entrance

100
00:25:53.720 --> 00:26:00.010
where you can drop off food and clothing and we just want to specify, of course everything's got to

101
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:07.070
be in great condition, uh, good condition at the very least. And um, in terms of the food, it has to

102
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.700
be unopened. And so those are the things that we just want to communicate, but we can start

103
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:19.810
receiving those donations starting next week as well. So next Sunday is our welcome back. Sunday. Um,

104
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:26.430
summer is not officially over, although it may feel like that a little today and we still have a few

105
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.490
more weeks, but it's a Sunday in which we'll take an opportunity to welcome you back to our

106
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:38.110
community of faith and we know this is a long weekend as well and many of you are gonna be resting

107
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:43.640
from your labors come tomorrow and not working. So those of you who are working, hopefully you'll

108
00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:50.830
find some time to be able to take that rest. But we are going to have a welcome back party as well.

109
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:55.680
And what that means is that we're going to have some inflatables for all ages, they're gonna be

110
00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:01.180
right here, we'll have stuff for the little toddlers. We'll have stuff for kids and then we'll have

111
00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.440
stuff for adults and it's going to be set up right here in the auditorium and then we'll have food

112
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:13.740
that we can all share and just enjoy. So, uh, Sunday. Um, next week we also have our kids program

113
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:19.390

114
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:27.590
Sunday for a great day where not only are our teachers well rested and back, ready to teach, but

115
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:33.990
we'll also have a great welcome back party, you guys excited for that. I know I am, it's uh it's

116
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:40.520
great to be together and in community and it's an opportunity for all of us to be able to just enjoy

117
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:48.610
each other. So we also have our after party cafe today which um, is back. So we took a couple of

118
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:54.880
weeks off just to give our baristas and our volunteers some time off, but it's just going to be be

119
00:27:54.890 --> 00:28:01.760
back to usual starting today. So you have your coffee and you have your hot beverages and other

120
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.480

121
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.950
encourage you guys with regards to the four ways that you can give. They're right here on the screen.

122
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:18.780
And each one of those is a great way for you to make a contribution to what we're doing here as a

123
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:25.040
ministry, how we're impacting lives each and every week. And the things that we're also trying to

124
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.850
relaunch, just like community kitchen and so all of that, giving goes towards that and we thank you

125
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:37.160
for your generosity. Well let's get ready for our message today, it's going to be the last in the

126
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:43.460
series of the genius of Jesus called the genius of the beautiful. Let's take a look and we'll just

127
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.720
begin in just a few moments.

128
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.380
Yeah,

129
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:16.890
There's this passage found in Psalm 19 that I just wanted to read to you and it's verse one and it

130
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:25.920
says that the heavens declare the glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands day

131
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:36.750
after day, they pour forth speech night after night. They display knowledge. There is no speech or

132
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:49.280
language where their voice is not heard. And what this passage tells us is that there is beauty all

133
00:29:49.280 --> 00:30:02.320
around us that we are witnesses to this each and every day and our souls recognize it. It testifies

134
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:13.170
not just to God, but it testifies to the beauty of God and that which is beautiful, can sometimes be

135
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:22.350
lost in the midst of our tragedy when we are going through things. We sometimes feel this sense

136
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:31.200
within us to go and find that which can restore us. It's hard to do that. Sometimes we don't have

137
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:40.360
the means or the finances, the resources to make that possible, but we all sense within us. This

138
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:50.260
need to be restored. And sometimes we find that restoration in nature. We find that in the beauty of

139
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:59.150
the silence and also of the noises that nature makes that soothes and sings to our soul. It has a

140
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:09.690
way of being a healing balm over us. And although we may not be taking moments in that nature itself

141
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:22.540
to speak to God God through nature is nonetheless speaking to us and in the midst of that time and

142
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:35.510
essence that we are absorbing this in the psalmist says it speaks to that which is beautiful even as

143
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:45.190
we go through that, which in us is tragedy. It's hard for us to fully grasp this and understand how

144
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:54.350
these two can not only coexist but how they sometimes just seemingly endlessly crash into each other.

145
00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:03.390
How the tragedy and the beauty just keep colliding. And and this was the struggle that Solomon had

146
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:12.060
in his own experience and in his own reflections. And when he writes Ecclesiastes, he talks about

147
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:19.350
this so eloquently in a matter that helps us to understand that there is indeed a time for every

148
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:26.990
season. But he shows us how in a season you can have both beauty and tragedy,

149
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:37.930
coexisting both fighting for dominance

150
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:51.020
and in Ecclesiastes three, Beginning at verse one, it says...

151
00:32:51.020 --> 00:33:02.520
a time for every activity under Heaven, A time to be born, and a time to die, A time to plant and a

152
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:12.080
time to harvest. There's a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build

153
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:22.210
up a time to cry and a time to laugh, a time to grieve. And even a time to dance, there was a time

154
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:30.370
to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to turn away a time to

155
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:38.430
search and a time to quit searching, a time to keep and a time to throw away a time to tear and a

156
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:44.850
time to mend the time to be quiet, and the time to speak. There was a time to love and a time to

157
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:54.060
hate. A time for war, and even a time for peace. What do people really get for all their hard work?

158
00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:06.340
I've seen the burden god has placed on us all, yet God has made everything beautiful for its own

159
00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:14.900
time. He has planted eternity in the human heart. But even so, people cannot see the whole scope of

160
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:26.750
God's work from beginning to end. So I concluded there was nothing better than to be happy and enjoy

161
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:37.230
ourselves as long as we can. And people should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor.

162
00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:44.940
For these are gifts from God. Can we say amen to the reading of his word. It's beautiful, isn't it?

163
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:59.450
Not all of that is permission. Some of that is just information. There are things in there that

164
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:06.220
happened that God is not saying it's okay that this happens, but we understand that this does

165
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:15.780
and we have to understand that what God is trying to show us is that even in the inner struggles of

166
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.320
Solomon's life,

167
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:32.210
that there is always beauty, even in tragedy, but we have to be able to see it, and that is

168
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:38.400
something that has to come from us. You see, he says there's always two narratives in every story

169
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:46.200
and and he shows how there are two things always happening in every verse in every verse, he's

170
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:53.250
showing that there are two things that are always happening, always taking place. And we may only be

171
00:35:53.250 --> 00:36:00.760
fixated on one and miss out on the other. We can be so caught up in the tragedy that we miss out

172
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:07.940
completely on the genius of the beautiful that is always there, that we can be so lost in the pain

173
00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:14.920
and the suffering that we don't have even hope to even begin to experience the healing that the

174
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:23.550
beauty is already alluded to, and showing that it can be possible. So, when we find ourselves in

175
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:29.790
this place, the human story, this human story, that is always this conflict between tragedy and

176
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:37.060
beauty, Solomon is saying to all of us, is there a way in which we can make sense of this? Is there

177
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:44.110
a way that we can under understand this? Is there a way that we can take this tragedy that we can

178
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:51.600
take the Brokenness that we can take the pain and the suffering, and still be able in all of this to

179
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.200
see a god who is showing and revealing his beauty,

180
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:07.450
And he tells us that we have to take both. Solomon's advice is that it's there for the taking all of

181
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:16.310
it. We had have one without the other. You have to have both. But there are those who are unable

182
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:27.880
to see it to experience it. And there's something that I wanted to show through a passage that is

183
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:37.680
often called the forbidden chapter. The Forbidden chapter is found in Isaiah chapter 53 and for

184
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:45.500
centuries, this chapter was always read and understood by the religious leaders in the jewish

185
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:54.740
community as being the passage of the Messiah. But when it became clear that people would read this,

186
00:37:54.810 --> 00:38:01.950
that it would point to someone in their history who this so closely resembled that they knew that

187
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:08.980
they could no longer read it. And so in the half Torah, which was the readings that would need to

188
00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:18.330
take place in the synagogues each week, they made a decision that chapter 53 would no longer be read,

189
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:27.360
That they would stop in the middle of Chapter 52, they would Skip chapter 53 and they would make

190
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:41.150
their way to chapter 54 because this chapter spoke in a manner that confused those that would hear

191
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:51.340
it. And so then rather than have them confused about who the Messiah was, they made the decision

192
00:38:51.950 --> 00:39:01.850
that Jesus couldn't be the Messiah. And so it became the forbidden chapter. And just in case you

193
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:10.270
think this is some kind of crazy, you know, conspiracy theory, I want you to know that if you go to

194
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:20.160
jewish sources and jewish scholars. this is what they say. In fact, one of those jewish scholars is

195
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:28.100
eating bar and this is what he says. He says that the 17th century jewish historian Rafael Levi

196
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:34.980
admitted that long ago. The rabbis used to read Isaiah 53 in the synagogues. But after the chapter

197
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.360
caused arguments in great confusion, the rabbis decided that the simplest thing would be to just

198
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:47.080
take the prophecy out of the half tara readings in synagogues. And that's why today when we read

199
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:56.130
Isaiah 52 we stop in the middle of the chapter And the week after we jump straight to Isaiah 54. Now

200
00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:02.190
it wouldn't make any sense to us if I just quoted this and then we just didn't get a chance to

201
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:08.170
actually read it. So we're gonna do that right now. We're gonna look at Isaiah chapter 53 and we're

202
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:14.000
gonna read for it For ourselves. We're going to read it for ourselves. And here at Verse one, it

203
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.050
says, who has believed our message to whom has the Lord revealed his powerful arm? My servant grew

204
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:30.620
up in the Lord's presence like a tender green shoot like a root in dry ground and there was nothing

205
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:40.660
beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him. He was despised and

206
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:47.270
rejected a man of sorrows. He was acquainted with the deepest grief. We turned our backs on him and

207
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:54.490
looked the other way he was despised and we did not care yet. It was our weaknesses. He carried. It

208
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.660
was our sorrows that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, a

209
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:05.680
punishment for his own sins. But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was

210
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:13.070
beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. All of us like sheep have

211
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:18.790
straight away. We have left God's path to follow our own. Yet the Lord laid on him the sins of us

212
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:26.030
all. He was oppressed and treated harshly. Yet he never said a word. He was led like a lamb to the

213
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:34.820
slaughter, and as a sheep in silence before the shearers, he did not open his mouth unjustly

214
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.690
condemned, he was led away. No one cared that he died without descendants, that his life was cut

215
00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:48.980
short in midstream. But he was struck down for the rebellion of my people. He had done no wrong, and

216
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:56.560
had never deceived anyone, but he was buried like a criminal. He was put in a rich man's grave. But

217
00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.340
it was the Lord's good plan to crush him and cause him grief. Yet when his life is made an offering

218
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:10.890
for sin, he will have many descendants, and he will enjoy a long life, and the Lord's good plan will

219
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:19.540
prosper in his hands, and when he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied.

220
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:27.040
And because of his experience, by righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted

221
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:36.060
righteous, for he will bear all their sins, I will give him the honors of the victorious soldiers

222
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:43.260
because he exposed himself to death, he was counted among the rebels. He bore the sins of many and

223
00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.500
he interceded for rebels.

224
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:56.760
And this passage is such a beautiful one, wouldn't you say? And it's so describes and parallels what

225
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:03.000
it looks like for us to understand the very life of Jesus and you can understand why they wouldn't

226
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:11.670
want this passage read because they don't want to acknowledge that Jesus is the Messiah, That he was

227
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:21.730
the promised one. Why? Because they don't want the tragedy. They only want the beauty.

228
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:30.960
This is not the Messiah they want. And many times in our own life, if you think about it, that is

229
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:36.860
not the God we want to believe in, that's not the Jesus we want to follow. We don't want the God and

230
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:45.140
the Jesus of the tragedy. We only want the God and the Jesus of the beauty. There is no place in us

231
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:52.570
for tragedy. There is no room in us for pain. There is no area of our life that we will accept

232
00:43:52.570 --> 00:44:01.230
suffering because that speaks contrary to the life that we would imagine would be the one that God

233
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:10.510
Has given us has created us. four has made sure that we could enjoy when he speaks to me having a

234
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:19.190
full life to me that says that I should not suffer, but when Jesus says I have come to give you a

235
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:27.680
life that is abundant. He's saying that I want you to understand that even in the midst of tragedy

236
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:38.380
of pain and of suffering, I can still overwhelm you with love with healing with victory, I can still

237
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:45.210
fill you and make sure that your life overflows with beauty.

238
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.600
I can show you

239
00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:52.970
both.

240
00:44:55.290 --> 00:45:01.510
And the beautiful thing about this passage is that it reminds us so clearly of how we can lose sight

241
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:11.210
of true beauty and only see tragedy of how easy it is to let the experiences of our life just shape

242
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:20.240
our lives in a way that continues to dictate it for years to come. I know that our case can change

243
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:26.660
over time. Has anyone ever realized that when I was a kid? My mom used to tell me that I used to

244
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:33.480
love liver. Like who loves liver? I've never met a person, there are people who love it but some

245
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.410
hands went up right away, that's kind of weird but okay

246
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:45.680
but my mom says I used to love it, I grew to hate it, I didn't want it anymore. But there were

247
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:52.150
things that I knew I couldn't eat just because the taste and texture things like like mushrooms, I

248
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.830
couldn't eat those before. I loved them. Now does it ever happen to you? Like your your taste just

249
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:04.120
kind of switch on you. I'm not talking about like a switch like between Starbucks, Starbucks coffee

250
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:10.370
and Tim Hortons or between you know, skittles and starbursts. I'm not talking about that kind of

251
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:18.630
switch, I'm talking about like real food that at some point at some point you you loved and then you

252
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:26.880
hate it or you hate it and now you love and and it's because you did something you you kept trying

253
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.180
it,

254
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:37.400
you didn't just stick to your past knowledge and experience. See if you still hate something,

255
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:44.360
chances are you probably haven't tasted it for a while. It could be that you haven't taken a bite of

256
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:49.410
that in a really long time. To the point that you're just so convinced that you hate that you always

257
00:46:49.410 --> 00:47:00.060
will that you may never ever know and discover that you now love it, where else has your past

258
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:10.540
experience been shaping your present reality and confirming what your future is going to be? Where

259
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:16.420
is it in your life that a past suffering tragedy, pain

260
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.350
is not allowed

261
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:28.600
to show you how it can be made beautiful.

262
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:40.110
You see Jesus becomes our savior when you get past the tragedy and you see the beauty, can we say

263
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:48.820
amen to that, that only becomes possible when you get past the tragedy. Someone recently told me

264
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:54.090
about their experience of seeing the passion of the Christ and how it shook them to their core, how

265
00:47:54.090 --> 00:48:00.670
they had never seen this movie but seeing it helped them to finally understand the tragedy and the

266
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:09.000
extent of the suffering that Jesus most possibly went through has depicted in that movie, in that

267
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:18.580
they finally understood the level of sacrifice that was given so that they could experience beauty.

268
00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:28.000
It's hard for us to grasp that to understand that. But Isaiah 53 verse two says this, there was

269
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:38.010
nothing beautiful, there was nothing majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him.

270
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.960
And in this is how we can be faced with beauty

271
00:48:48.930 --> 00:49:00.200
and not recognize it in the same way that you can stand before truth and not see it. You can stand

272
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:08.210
before absolute perfection and beauty but be so corrupted in your mind and in your heart so darkened

273
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:16.070
by sin, so unable to see the beauty that you see nothing that is majestic in it. Nothing that is

274
00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:25.010
beautiful, nothing that is perfect, nothing other than that, which we would just say is ordinary. I

275
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:32.510
know so many people who are broken down by the darkness of their hearts that they are faced with

276
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:39.720
beauty every day and cannot see it because they are captured and wrapped up and packaged for life

277
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:46.200
and the suffering they've been through the tragedy is that they have lived. They cannot let them go

278
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:54.210
and they won't be released by them either. I need you to understand that you are in a fight for your

279
00:49:54.210 --> 00:50:04.500
life, you are in a fight for beauty that God is able to show you. Why be stuck in the tragedy when

280
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:16.170
he has beauty instead for you. Have you not heard he turns ashes into beauty? Have you not heard he

281
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:24.610
takes that which is darkness and makes it light? Have you not heard he can take that which is wrong

282
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:32.800
and he can make it right that which is death and turn it into life that which is lost. He can make

283
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:42.120
it found. He can take any tragedy, every tragedy and make that beauty instead. Amen. Are you ready

284
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.600
for that in your own life?

285
00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:53.580
Why keep believing the lie? Why keep living that? Why keep experiencing the Brokenness of that? Why

286
00:50:53.580 --> 00:51:03.690
keep having that repeat over and over and over again in your life. We have to be drawn to the beauty

287
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:13.270
and drawn away from the tragedy, drawn to the beauty, not the tragedy. And I know that there's some

288
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:17.730
people, Oh man, we just we're just so done with them because we're done with the drama. Isn't it

289
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:24.530
true? We're just done with the drama. We just can't do it anymore. And I know that we get to a place

290
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:32.400
in our hearts listen where we have limits. And then and then sometimes we draw the line and we set

291
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.920
the limits instead of letting God draw the line and letting him set the limits

292
00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:48.280
and we make mistakes. We make mistakes and mistakes that are tragic that do not lead us to Beauty.

293
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:53.800
when we set those limits and we don't pray about those limits, we don't give them to God. We don't,

294
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:59.100
we don't ask him to expand those boundaries, We don't ask him to give us more patients, We don't ask

295
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:04.860
him to show show us is this worth investing in still, is this worth fighting for? Is this worth

296
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:11.360
pouring into? Is this worth still giving my time to? Is this still worth me believing in it? God? Is

297
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:19.250
there still room in this for this tragedy to become beauty? Is there and let God give you that

298
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:26.880
answer and listen, when he gives it to you, you're gonna know. And then like in the scriptures, like

299
00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:38.010
Jesus taught his disciples, they can come a time when you can shake the dust from your sandals from

300
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:48.300
your life, you can just say it's okay that I'm done with this, It's okay. I've given everything that

301
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:55.420
I could possibly give God has given me permission, He has released me, I let go of this and I

302
00:52:55.420 --> 00:53:01.180
embraced the future and the beauty that is in front of me and I let go of the past and the tragedy

303
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.550
and the drama that is behind me amen.

304
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:14.590
That's how we've got to do it. And if we don't do it like this, then we're gonna have more problems

305
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:21.110
more tragedy and we are not going to be able to experience the redemption of God's Beauty the way

306
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:27.650
that he intended and that is not what God wants for our lives and that's why john who is such an

307
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:34.950
incredibly poetic apostle, like when he writes, he doesn't give us any background of how Jesus was

308
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:40.810
born and anything else. He just talks about Jesus being the word, he just starts off with that,

309
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:49.590
Jesus is the word and the word was with us, that word is the life, the word is everything, Jesus was

310
00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:59.820
everything and he doesn't so incredibly um he doesn't, it was gonna make up a word there, I'm not

311
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:08.680
gonna do that. Uh he does it in the most incredibly beautiful way In John Chapter 1: verse one and

312
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.430
so I want us to read these passages because they're so powerful. I know we're reading a lot of

313
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:23.620
scripture today, but that's okay. And so it says this, the word became human. And look at this, he

314
00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.910
made his home among us

315
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.430
and he was full of unfailing love.

316
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:47.040
How many of you are not feeling so loved right now, How many of you are not feeling the faithfulness

317
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:53.710
of God towards you right now. How many of you need to see his glory? How many of you need to

318
00:54:53.710 --> 00:55:03.460
understand that glory of, of Jesus transforming your tragedy into beauty. It's right here, it's

319
00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:14.270
right here, the word became flesh became human and he made his home among us. Listen, if all your

320
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:24.610
living is tragedy sadness, if all you're experiencing is pain and and sorrow. Do you not see that

321
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:31.680
the word that became human and has made his home with you?

322
00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:42.360
That all you see is tragedy instead of beauty, You're not gonna be able to experience that unfailing

323
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:49.030
love, that faithfulness. You're not going to be able to see the glory that God has for you. But when

324
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:57.300
you turn entirely towards Jesus and you say, I will embrace this tragedy, not because I want to, but

325
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:05.120
because I know it will lead me to the beauty. Because if you have made your home with me, you will

326
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:10.140
show me the love, You will show me the faithfulness. You will show me the glory that I need to see.

327
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:20.380
I will not keep living a story of tragedy when you have one of beauty for me instead is that you you

328
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:28.230
believe that for yourself? You need that for you. Maybe I want that for you more than you wanted for

329
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:35.240
yourself right now. Maybe more than you're ready. Maybe more than you're able to get excited about.

330
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:42.590
Maybe because the tragedy is just so deep. But look what it says in Matthew 27

331
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:58.430
Verse 45 and 46 At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until 3:00 PMclock And then about 3:00,

332
00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:07.810
Jesus called out with a loud voice, eli eli Lema, which means, my God, my God, why have you

333
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:20.040
abandoned me? And I want you to know that this moment here in the life of Jesus is his greatest

334
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:30.150
tragedy and his greatest tragedy. It's because he took all of our tragedies upon himself. He

335
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:39.130
experienced a separation for the very first time from the father and from the Spirit. He experienced

336
00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:49.350
unknowable pain and suffering. He didn't say a word while he was being beaten, not a word when his

337
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:57.310
flesh was being torn, not a word when he was being spat on and speared. Not a word, but in the

338
00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:07.240
moment when all of our tragedies came upon him, it is then that Jesus speaks, and so, you know, that

339
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:13.160
the greatest moment of his tragedy, of his pain, of his suffering was that moment, right? There

340
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:21.850
there was no greater moment. Now, if this is all that we would have, then what a sad story it would

341
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:30.960
be. For sure. Let's all give up. But you know what he says after this is is finished. Can we say

342
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:39.860
amen to that? It is finished. It means that there is no tragedy that can persist. There is no pain

343
00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:51.590
that can per main. There is nothing that can keep us trapped in the sorrow of this life, nothing

344
00:58:52.470 --> 00:59:04.160
Jesus has given us that victory. And in that moment Jesus expresses on the cross the fullness of

345
00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:13.780
humanity's tragedy. But in that moment we also get to experience it being transformed into the most

346
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:26.100
beautiful moment of all time. And if you give God the opportunity, You two get to say in your life.

347
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:35.280
It is finished. I could think back on that moment, it's finished. I can think back on that time, it

348
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.580
is finished. I can think at that moment where I had pain and suffering and sorrow, where I had

349
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:51.980
tragedy, it is finished in Jesus name, it is finished and before I can even get there and feel it

350
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:59.380
and it does nothing to me. I see it today every day until, until it is finished, until Jesus

351
00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:05.800
finishes the work, until he transforms the tragedy into beauty. Every day. In my mind and in my

352
01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:12.810
heart, I keep saying it is finished, it is finished, it is over, it is done. It will no longer have

353
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:21.640
any rule or mastery over me. Can you do that in your life? Even before you experience it until the

354
01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:27.320
moment you start talking about it and the pain that you thought you feel like you felt every other

355
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:35.200
time, it's finally gone because it is finished because God took it away. He turned it into something

356
01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:42.700
beautiful. You gave him enough time for him to take that tragedy and turn it into beauty. You gave

357
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:49.100
him the time that he needed to show you that your eyes could finally see that when you only saw

358
01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:57.220
tragedy, God was already working out to the beauty. That's why it says in Romans, that all things

359
01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:08.090
work for the good of those who love God, all things, you know what that means? It means that satan

360
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:21.760
doesn't get anything. He doesn't get anything in your life. It all belongs to God and God can do

361
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:31.040
something beautiful with it. Let God transform your tragedy into beauty today. Let him go into the

362
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.170
innermost parts of your mind and your heart and your life and let him transform it. Don't let satan

363
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:44.820
have the victory anywhere. Don't let your mind trick you into believing anything other than this

364
01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:50.990
will be turned into beauty. Can you trust God for that? Maybe you're not all the way there, Maybe

365
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:57.250
you're some of the way there. Maybe today these scriptures have somehow compelled you to believe a

366
01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:03.450
different story, A different narrative. But I know that God can take you all of the way there. He

367
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:10.430
can move you from where you are to where he knows, you can experience his beauty. God bless you.

368
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:14.860
Thank you so much. Can we pray together? Thank you.

369
01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:23.560
Did you stand with me and I want you to be just be honest and sincere with God. Just be transparent

370
01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:34.620
with him. I want you to just would you confess with your mouth with your heart, with your life, the

371
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:42.590
tragedy, the tragedy? Would you do that? Would you give that to God right now? And would you ask him,

372
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:51.380
would you ask God, would you ask Jesus to transform that into beauty and father as we are before you

373
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:59.900
and as we in simplicity of heart and of life, not fully understanding how you can accomplish that

374
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:07.400
and do that, not how you can take a painful and dark and broken moment and turn it into something

375
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:16.480
beautiful. We don't know how you're going to do that in our lives, but we know God that you can, you

376
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.820
did it in the life of Jesus and you can do it in ours as well. You made it possible for him so that

377
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:31.380
he could make everything possible in all of us. Right now, Lord, you see where we need you the most

378
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:38.630
and and where that transformation has to take place the most and we surrender it to you. Lord. We

379
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:50.240
give it to you, we hand you our tragedies. And we ask that you transform them into beauty in Jesus'

380
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:57.400
name. We pray Amen. Amen. You feel you feel a little bit better. Hopefully a little bit more

381
01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:03.290
encouraged a little bit more directed towards what God wants you to do in your life. I pray that

382
01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:07.710
that's true and and I hope that we can get a moment to talk about it afterwards as well. If there's

383
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.030
anything that we can do to help you take your next steps, would love to be able to do that. But

384
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:17.140
right now I want us to sing this song one more time and as we would do that, it gives us a moment to

385
01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:20.630
reflect on everything that we've heard everything that we've been through everything that

386
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:27.940
emotionally God has brought up and maybe every thought that that needs to be brought back captive to

387
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:34.510
Jesus and and and allow him to take every tragedy and turn that into beauty. Every place where

388
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:41.470
someone has had victory over you. That that God would give you the victory instead. And so as you

389
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:47.160
would sing these words, I want you to understand the power of worship and praise that when we take

390
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:52.450
the attention and the focus off of ourselves and we put it on God and we go outside of ourselves, we

391
01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:58.750
put it on something greater than us. Then we begin to believe in the miraculous and we begin to

392
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:05.490
experience the miraculous. We begin to understand how the miraculous can take any moment and just

393
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:10.870
transform it for our good. And this is the moment that I want you so desperately to experience. So

394
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:20.290
don't see this as a dumb sing along. I don't have a great voice, my wife does. I'm not a singer but

395
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:25.590
but I love to worship because it is in those moments that I feel the transcendent presence of God

396
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:33.660
where I'm captured and captivated and I'm brought into the very presence of our living God. And so

397
01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:38.610
if you would take this moment you will be changed and transformed by it and it won't be about what's

398
01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:44.890
happening up here anymore. It'll be about what's happening right here and what God does in you and

399
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:50.530
what he does through you. Why am I preaching another message? I don't know, but I just felt like I

400
01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:56.630
needed to say that. Okay, I don't know who needed to hear that. But hopefully I it reached the one

401
01:05:56.630 --> 01:06:00.620
person that needed it. So God bless you. Let's sing this song and I'll be back in a few moments.

402
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:01.710
Okay? Thank you.

403
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.340
Just,

404
01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:24.720
they'll say my God is still the same.

405
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.690
If they do,

406
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:45.040
they'll seem still the same. Wendy break his promise. When did his kindness fail? Never has, never

407
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:57.200
will. My God is still the same when loses power? When did his mercy change? Never have, Never will.

408
01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:00.320
My God still the same.

409
01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:06.190
God,

410
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.080
You pray?

411
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:23.240
They'll say my guide is still the same.

412
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:29.330
If it's strong, keep

413
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.330
they'll say, my God.

414
01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:45.930
When did he break his promise? When did it kind of failed. Never has, never will. My God is still

415
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:56.500
the same when loses power when change? Never had. Never will. My God

416
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:01.240
now, once did he ever start?

417
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.030
Once has he ever stopped proving how God is in?

418
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.000
Does he ever stop moving

419
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:17.800
one?

420
01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:30.820
I've got is in control. Wendy break his promise. Wended his. Never have, never will.

421
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.180
When

422
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:45.060
change. Never had. Never will the same.

423
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:49.020
Did he ever stop moving?

424
01:08:52.660 --> 01:09:00.750
Once. Did he ever stop proving control? one City ever stop moving?

425
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.970
Never will.

426
01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:24.590
Let's sing it all together. Hallelujah, I've got feel the same. Hallelujah praise God.

427
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:34.580
Well that one that felt different for me after that message and I pray that it felt different for

428
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.150
you as well, just uh it feels so good to be able to be in the presence of God together as a

429
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:44.770
community and to have so many of you back and to have so many more of you back next week, I wanna

436
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:31.330
means for your present, your past and for your future. I know that God is going to have a special

uh to just pray for our students, can we do that father? I know how we can be a student at different

442
01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:12.330
times in our lives and there are people who are going back to school and there repositioning

443
01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:17.330
themselves and re creating a new life for themselves by doing so and then there are those who are

444
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:26.890
just continuing their educational journey and they're at another spot and point in their life. And I

445
01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:34.840
pray that whoever it is, that that is in education right now, both as a student and a teacher, both

446
01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:43.690
as someone who is retraining themselves or getting trained. I pray that you would help them all,

447
01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:51.140
that you put your hand of blessing upon them, help them to achieve their goal and the goal that you

448
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:57.750
have for their life, that you would show them the true measure of success and what it means to take

449
01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:04.100
their faith into the classroom and what it means to take their faith into the schoolyard and what it

450
01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:12.360
means to take their life with Jesus into all phases of life. I pray that you would bless them and

451
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:19.470
prosper them, You would protect them, that you would keep them from evil and those who would intend

452
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:30.030
evil for them, We pray your God that you would watch over them as they walk at night or as they walk

453
01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:40.870
in the daylight, that you would be with each and every one of them in Jesus name. We pray. Amen.

454
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.400
Amen. It's a good prayer to pray and I just thank you for that, thank you for joining me in doing

455
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:53.190
