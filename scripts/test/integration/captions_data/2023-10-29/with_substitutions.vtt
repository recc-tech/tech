160
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.180
this is home. And when I'm here, I feel like this is home too. But I believe that God has given me a

161
00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:40.520
global citizenship. So wherever I am, I believe that he's home, but it's really for me a privilege.

162
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:48.420
So thank you Pastor Lorenzo and the leadership for inviting me and for allowing me to speak to you.

163
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:54.290
And uh you know, I want to bring you greetings from South Africa. My family is there. I I went back

164
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.939
a couple of years ago and I was trying to just, you know, hear what God is saying to me and how He

165
00:30:59.949 --> 00:31:04.185
wants to unfold my own story. So it's going to be an easy transition, but God has been teaching me

166
00:31:04.194 --> 00:31:09.064
quite a bit. And so hopefully some of those things will come through my message today, but South

167
00:31:09.074 --> 00:31:15.354
Africa is, is happy. And I think for those of you who are are sports fans, uh let us celebrate that

168
00:31:15.364 --> 00:31:20.305
the South African rugby team became the world champions for those who are. So

169
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:29.780
it's amazing. So the whole country is in celebration. But today, my heart is going to be really

170
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:35.989
asking you to take the next few minutes like 30 minutes or so just to really be sensitive to the

171
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.300
spirit of God and to hear what he has to say to each one of us because I believe that when it comes

172
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:48.380
to a gathering like this and uh when you know that you've worshiped and that God is already prepared,

173
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:54.579
he went ahead of this gathering because he wanted to speak to you individually. So God always speaks

174
00:31:54.589 --> 00:31:59.859
to us individually and God also speaks to us corporately. So he's going to speak to us as a church

175
00:31:59.869 --> 00:32:05.489
and also for you personally. So I pray that the message today would be custom made for your heart.

176
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:11.959
And for your future, one of the things that I'm really strongly about is that we need to know what

177
00:32:11.969 --> 00:32:17.369
is God, what is God doing in the earth today? And if you just open your news, if you open your own

178
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.270
stories, you know that the world is not in a very good place. There's so much pressure, there's so

179
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.949
much challenge. But I want to say this morning to you that this is our time to rise. This is our

180
00:32:28.959 --> 00:32:35.640
season as a church globally, to be able to position ourselves to truly be light and truly be salt of

181
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:43.719
the earth. And so we need each other to help one another to give tools to grow and to create spaces

182
00:32:43.729 --> 00:32:49.369
where we can actually receive what we need to receive for the journey. And so this is why my heart

183
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:56.619
is really for that. And so I want to go straight actually to a verse that I have here, it's just a

184
00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:03.119
little bit aside to the message that I have. It's found in Psalm four verses 6 to 7. And here the

185
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:11.079
psalmist is saying, and I'm going to read it from my book David. It is David. Actually, he says, let

186
00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:16.400
the light of your radiance. In other words, the light of God shine upon each one of you. And I'm

187
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:22.800
gonna just take the word so that it can make, you know, personal to you. And he said, your

188
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:27.640
breakthrough and the light, I'm translating it. He said your light and your goodness and your

189
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:36.619
encounter with me is far more pleasurable than harvest time. And this the gladness in my heart, then

190
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:42.609
the new wine. And so I was thinking, I was trying to look for a verse or for a, for a concept with

191
00:33:42.619 --> 00:33:47.119
the harvest time here because this is what harvest time is now in Canada. Although South Africa is

192
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:53.199
going into this summer, you are going into your winter. And during harvest time, we all want to, you

193
00:33:53.209 --> 00:34:02.359
know, receive or experience the food of our hands. Am I speaking to myself or? Uh so I think it's

194
00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:08.250
important and I, I know for myself and for your life, we don't want to sow seeds and work hard and

195
00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:16.030
not see any results or any fruit. And yet David is saying when I come into your presence and when I

196
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:23.689
encounter you, when I see the face and when I see the goodness and your beauty, then even that is

197
00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:28.459
nothing in comparison with all the harvest that I will be having. And so this is really just a, a

198
00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:34.699
verse today, a chapter today. In your story, I want to take us to the spiritual harvest that we need

199
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:41.050
and that we need to have that fruitfulness in our life so that we can be light and so that we can be

200
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.469
hope carriers and light carriers. And so this is just something that I was yearning for and I was

201
00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:50.860
saying, I'm not so sure if I can say those words exactly like the psalmist would say. But I desire

202
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:57.330
that, hey, I'm sure you too, you desire that intimacy with God and that closes with Him that when

203
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:03.689
you come into his presence and when we behold Him, that everything else actually dims in comparison.

204
00:35:04.169 --> 00:35:11.260
Are you with me? So I'm going to read for you. Uh Matthew chapter 13 verses 19 to 23. And if you

205
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.989
have notes or phone notes, I want to encourage you to take a little bit of notes because uh you know

206
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.169
that we learn better and we return better when we write things down. Uh So I'm gonna read the word.

207
00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:26.780
I'm gonna read God's word and then I want to just glean from this chapter what I want to talk to you

208
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:31.790
about. I think you can follow up on the screen, but I'm going to read from the passion media team.

209
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.000
You're gonna have the passion version that I'm using. And so here Jesus is actually speaking to his

210
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.459
disciples and it talks about the soul where you heard, you know the story. And so some of the seed

211
00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:47.179
would fall on, on rocky, on a pavement, some would fall on rocky soil, some would fall hard. And so,

212
00:35:47.379 --> 00:35:52.290
but I want to just read the part where Jesus interprets. Now, what is the seed, what, what talk

213
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:57.270
about seed and soil and why do I talk about rich soil? And I'm going to read the word because the

214
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.479
word of God speaks louder than any other thing. So let me just get, and I'm gonna get a little bit

215
00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:06.949
of light. If you don't mind, I'm just gonna use my phone because I don't have too much light. So the

216
00:36:06.959 --> 00:36:13.840
seed that fell on the, on the beaten path says represents the heart of one,

217
00:36:16.129 --> 00:36:22.110
represent the, the one who hears the message of the kingdom realm but doesn't understand it. The

218
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:28.500
adversary comes and snatches away the sown what was sown into his heart. So I want you to remember

219
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:35.790
two words, their heart and soil. The seed sown on, on gravel represents a person who gladly hears

220
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:41.850
the kingdom message. But his experience remains shallow shortly after you hear the word persecution

221
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:47.580
and troubles will come because the Kingdom message is is not received. Then he quickly falls away

222
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:54.629
for the truth did not sink deeply into his heart. The seed sown among the weeds represents the

223
00:36:54.639 --> 00:37:00.300
person who receives the message, but all of life's business distractions, his divided heart, his

224
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:07.850
ambition for wealth results in suffocating the very message of the kingdom and prevents him. I'm

225
00:37:07.889 --> 00:37:13.379
going to say him, him or her from bearing spiritual fruit. We're looking at why we cannot receive

226
00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:20.489
now, this is where my verse comes in as for the seed that fell upon good and rich soil. There you go

227
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:28.489
rich oil. It represents the hearts of people. So rich soil represents your heart who use fully. The

228
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:36.129
word embraces it fully. And then you understand the kingdom realm and their lives bear good fruit.

229
00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:47.389
Some yield a harvest of 30 fruit, some yielded a harvest of 60 even 100 times as was sown. The

230
00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:57.290
other verse that I have for us is in John chapter 15, uh John 16 to 17. I'll read it from here if

231
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.379
you have it here. Now, you did not choose me. Jesus telling his disciples was very closely, but I

232
00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:07.909
chose you and appointed you and I want you to put your own name in here. So you did not choose me,

233
00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:16.409
but I chose you my name Yvonne for you to go bear fruit, much fruit, fruit that will last. So that

234
00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:19.260
whatever you ask in my name, the father will give you,

235
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:30.050
this is my commandment, love each other. So father, I pray now that as we open a heart and I pray

236
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.310
that you would pray this prayer right now in the silence of your moment, father, give me a receiving

237
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.810
heart,

238
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.100
give me a heart that is open, open the eyes of my understanding to receive what you have to say to

239
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:47.669
me. As the Holy Spirit come breathe upon your word. I pray that you would speak the word and you

240
00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:52.659
translate it so that even what I say, maybe it will be different when people hear it in their hearts.

241
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:58.389
So I come against any distractions and I pray that we would know that we are in s in a sacred space,

242
00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:04.000
a safe place because you love us in the name of the Father, son and Holy Spirit. All the people

243
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:12.379
shout, amen. Amen. So I'm gonna try to be as brief as possible to come to those things that are

244
00:39:12.389 --> 00:39:17.320
really dear to my own heart. And I believe God has taught me a few things even during this last two

245
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:22.479
years. And so I really want to encourage you people that one of the things that, that can rob us of

246
00:39:22.489 --> 00:39:27.959
our spiritual health and of our own success is that that arrival mentality that we think that we

247
00:39:27.969 --> 00:39:33.379
don't know, we, we don't need to learn more. And I pray that today and my heart for myself and for

248
00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:39.399
all of you, I pray that you would become and remain curious that you would remain wide eyed and open.

249
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:44.580
So you can always yearn and be desirous of growth. And so this is one of the things that I've asked

250
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:49.719
God to teach me. What do I need to know that? I don't know, you know, I felt that in my own

251
00:39:49.729 --> 00:39:54.629
spiritual life, I've exhausted a level and I needed God to take me to new, new levels and new

252
00:39:54.639 --> 00:40:00.080
dimensions. And so I really spend more time just with this word and listening. And so one of the

253
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:05.090
things that I that I believe is my signature message is the message of restoration. And I believe

254
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.949
that God can restore our hearts. And there's a message of that inner life, that healing. But one of

255
00:40:09.959 --> 00:40:15.360
the things that really got me again just to support it is when it comes to the heart, when it comes

256
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:22.189
to the word, and when it comes to our soil, that the very soil of your heart is that space where you

257
00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:28.989
determine whether you receive or you don't receive. So all of us know that if your heart is hardened

258
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:33.510
people, we not gonna receive anything. Even if I tell them the most beautiful things about your life.

259
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:39.050
If you have a hard heart, you're not gonna receive. So even when I speak to you, if you have places

260
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.320
in your heart where it is hardened or is skeptical, you know what I'm gonna say is gonna go over

261
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.699
your heads. And so therefore I say to God, make my heart soft, even if I don't fully understand,

262
00:40:48.899 --> 00:40:54.500
give me an open heart. And so here Jesus is saying to the to to his disciples that the seed. So

263
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:59.554
every week you hear the word, every day, you listen, you read the word of God. So it's seeds that

264
00:40:59.564 --> 00:41:05.604
are sown into your spirit. And every day we have an opportunity to receive it and for the seed to

265
00:41:05.614 --> 00:41:11.475
sprout in our life so that we can be fruitful so we can grow. So that we can have impact in this

266
00:41:11.485 --> 00:41:17.179
world so that we can be influential. All of those things are part of bearing fruit. But yet at the

267
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:24.189
same time, we are very afraid to look at our hearts. We are very afraid to look at the dimension of

268
00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:30.110
us. That's a bit private because we don't allow many people there. And so today, I want to just

269
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.850
invite us into a space where you and Jesus can sit there for a bit. You know, he said, if, if you

270
00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:41.909
invite me into your heart, I'll make my home in your heart. And so the soil, I want to really in a

271
00:41:41.919 --> 00:41:47.570
spiritual way as in the earth, like when you have your garden and your garden is full of weeds,

272
00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:53.580
you're gonna take all the weeds out before you actually sow seeds, correct? For those of you who are

273
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:59.090
gardeners and you can discover that there are rocks, there are weeds and you are also going to

274
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.239
discover that there are good seeds that have been hidden or covered by those things that are not

275
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.899
good. And so this is the metaphor. This is the image that I want to use when it comes to our inner

276
00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:16.330
life. Correct? So the heart and heart is a heart. I know that you have to just dance with me, but

277
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:22.689
I'm gonna just jump a little bit with my notes. The heart and hard is I just want to explain like

278
00:42:22.699 --> 00:42:28.679
maybe I can ask you the question when you're hard, what does a hard, hard looks like? You know, what

279
00:42:28.689 --> 00:42:34.739
kind of behavior would come out of your, out of you if your heart is hardened, how do you act? How

280
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:42.199
do you respond? How do you interact if your heart is hard as opposed to when your heart is rich? And

281
00:42:42.209 --> 00:42:45.899
so I'm just gonna give you a few pointers and I want you to really go into your own heart because

282
00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:51.939
there are parts of us where it is hardened. You know, for example, if you feel like you have and I'm

283
00:42:51.949 --> 00:43:00.290
gonna have all of these examples here that if you've been disappointed for a long time, oh, you've

284
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:07.449
been hurt and those hurts have not been resolved. Your heart becomes hardened and your heart becomes

285
00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:08.120
closed

286
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:15.189
if you have, if you say God. But what are you doing in my life? I don't understand your activity in

287
00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:19.760
my life and you feel that God has forgotten you abandoned you and then you become hardened and you

288
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:24.149
don't listen to him because your heart becomes hardened. You know, when we grieve and we've been

289
00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:29.909
hurt and we kind of make sense of our pain and we haven't, you know, navigated that our hearts

290
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:34.510
become hardened. And so those are all things and I don't want to go into too extensively, but I want

291
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.340
you to listen to your own heart and say, what does it look like for my heart when it's hardened,

292
00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:43.860
when I come into the presence of people that are very critical, that are very cynical, that are

293
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:49.570
indifferent. That is a hard heart. When the heart is full of bitterness, your heart becomes hard. So

294
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.889
when you come into God's presence, and you say, God, I want you to give me your plan for my life, I

295
00:43:53.899 --> 00:43:59.530
want to give you my, you give me your road map for my success. And then God says, yes, here it is,

296
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:06.600
but we didn't hear because the heart is still hard because our capacity to receive is limited. And

297
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:13.429
so therefore, today, I want to ask God by his spirit to visit each one of us today and to go into

298
00:44:13.439 --> 00:44:19.149
those spaces and say, come, I want to shine my light, not only shine my light and expose it, but

299
00:44:19.159 --> 00:44:25.560
also I want to heal and restore and rewrite your story and give you a new chapter, a new narrative.

300
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:32.129
So you can be freed up to become the version of who God has created you to be for the season. I

301
00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:36.830
think those things are so important that we need to understand because in my own life and I'm sure

302
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.479
in your life too, I have these dreams. I have these things that I want to have. But this version of

303
00:44:41.489 --> 00:44:48.179
me is not ready for what I want to, to, to be. And so I need to work on my becoming like I was I was

304
00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:51.719
reading a quote the other day, what, what you're looking for is also looking for you. What do you

305
00:44:51.729 --> 00:44:56.520
want is also looking for you? So we need to move in that place. So today I just want to say so that

306
00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:01.830
is a hard and hard. But now when it comes to the ritual, what does the rich soil looks like? How

307
00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:07.129
does, how does, why does Jesus put so much emphasis? He says, you will produce fruit that is 30 60

308
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:12.179
100. In other words, it takes us two dimensions. He says, I didn't just want you to have little

309
00:45:12.959 --> 00:45:20.120
because you've been made for so much more today. I want you to hear that you have been and I've been

310
00:45:20.129 --> 00:45:24.719
created even in this very moment where you are at, even if you feel like you're at your best game,

311
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:30.729
there is still more for us, more for us to experience more, for us to become and more for us to

312
00:45:30.739 --> 00:45:37.189
influence in this world. Are you with me on this one? You agree with me? Now, anything, anything in

313
00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:42.030
your, in your mind and your heart that disagrees with, that is something that you need to confront.

314
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.389
And so God is saying, I want your heart to be rich and I want it to be fertile and I want to be able

315
00:45:47.399 --> 00:45:52.729
to plant seeds today in your life that will produce fruit. And so I've been, I want to share with

316
00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:59.500
you a few keys that I have uh five keys that I thought are like nutrients. How can I develop? How

317
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:06.070
can I cultivate a heart that is rich? What does it look like? Because I can still reach out? But we

318
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.600
don't always know like I needed to say God, please show me. And so I have a few. It's not, that's

319
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:16.889
not all but for me today, this is what I want to. I want to do this because I really want us to

320
00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:22.830
become and I want you to, I want to declare that over your life. Just say it with me. I am rich soil,

321
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:29.909
I am rich soil. I am rich soil even if you don't believe it right now. But this is where you're

322
00:46:29.919 --> 00:46:36.060
gonna be rich soil because inside of you, you know, there is a beautiful verse

323
00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:42.679
that says the very same power that raised Jesus from the dead is inside of you. And if that is true,

324
00:46:42.879 --> 00:46:48.449
what does it look like? There's so many things that we know in our, in our heads, but it never comes

325
00:46:48.459 --> 00:46:53.179
down to the heart because the heart needs to be cultivated. We need to tilt it and we need to look

326
00:46:53.189 --> 00:46:59.419
what it's inside so that we can actually either remove or add or flourish what is in there. So I'm

327
00:46:59.429 --> 00:47:05.725
gonna go through this uh as briefly as possible is there are five and then I will, I'm going to

328
00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:10.375
start this message and I will leave Pastor Lorenzo to finish, you know, he's got a whole series

329
00:47:10.385 --> 00:47:15.864
after this or whatever I can do, you can add the pieces together. So the first thing that, that,

330
00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:23.304
that I want to share with us and is found in Ephesians chapter 367 is that for you to have a life

331
00:47:23.314 --> 00:47:31.409
and a heart that is rich in your heart, rich, you need to be rooted in love, rooted in love, rooted

332
00:47:31.419 --> 00:47:36.850
in love. You're gonna hear this over and over rooted in love. But I want to ask God by his spirit to

333
00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:42.879
renew our hearts. So we not become so familiar with these verses. Uh Ephesians chapter three verses

334
00:47:42.889 --> 00:47:51.030
63 16 to 17. I pray that out of his glorious riches. Uh I'm gonna just read it in the uh passion

335
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:57.699
here, out of the, out of his riches because there are some verses that III I kind of like a little

336
00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:06.290
bit more. It just puts it a bit more nicer for me out of as rich as 3 17. I just thought maybe you

337
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:16.489
had, you had that OK? And I pray that, that he would unveil just listen to this at pre that Jesus

338
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:24.679
would unveil within you, the unlimited reaches of His glorious favor upon your life and that there

339
00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:32.489
would be supernatural strength would flow in your inner being that is your heart. And then he says,

340
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:40.300
then by constantly using your faith, the life of Christ will be released deep inside of you. And the

341
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:49.270
resting place of his love will become the very source of your life. And then this life will be the

342
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.020
root of your life, the very love will be the root of your life. In other words, the nutrients of

343
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:59.899
your heart is love. If you look at this neuroscience, and if you look at all these studies, our

344
00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:04.469
brains and our hearts have been created for love and it can only respond to love, it can only be

345
00:49:04.479 --> 00:49:09.639
healed. So therefore, the catalyst for all of our pain is love. But we don't always understand what

346
00:49:09.649 --> 00:49:14.560
is love because we don't always receive that because we've been hardened and hurt and we don't like

347
00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:20.114
to go into those places. So we just leave our hearts behind and we think that we can be alive. So

348
00:49:20.125 --> 00:49:26.455
when I close my heart off, I'm also closing my heart off to joy and excitement and beauty and all

349
00:49:26.465 --> 00:49:31.435
the beautiful things and the awe. So many people tell me, oh, I feel numb in my heart. It's OK. Even

350
00:49:31.445 --> 00:49:36.985
the fact that you can say that is already something OK? Because you identify what's inside. So the

351
00:49:36.995 --> 00:49:42.215
love is just something that I believe that we have been so useless, speaking about love. But we

352
00:49:42.225 --> 00:49:50.030
don't fully understand the depth thereof. You know, one of the beautiful things that Jesus um told

353
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:57.189
his disciples. He said to them, stay within me. He says the very same love and even me at this stage

354
00:49:57.199 --> 00:50:01.360
in my life, I'm still saying, God, I don't fully get this. He said the very same love that the

355
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:07.449
Father has for me, I have for you. And I want you to think about that, the very same love that God

356
00:50:07.459 --> 00:50:14.550
has for Jesus. He has with each one of us. So this is very much our strength and our security when

357
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:20.770
we go through our pain and our confusion, because we know that we loved and so love deeply seep into

358
00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:26.465
our soul of our heart, makes the heart fertile love for each other. I mean, this is a big thing. We

359
00:50:26.475 --> 00:50:31.885
need to know how to love one another. We need to know how to really work in unity. Otherwise we

360
00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:35.935
won't be able to respond to what's happening in the world. We see already how even Christians are

361
00:50:35.945 --> 00:50:41.264
responding with so much hatred. When you just look at social media, for example, we have been

362
00:50:41.274 --> 00:50:47.965
transformed by light and by love. And so I want to ask Jesus even this very moment said God open my

363
00:50:47.975 --> 00:50:53.479
understanding to really receive the love and know what you have done for me. So rooted in love is so

364
00:50:53.489 --> 00:51:00.080
important that you know that your life that you am I talking about loving God or loving others, know

365
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:06.250
that you are the beloved. That's a different narrative that you are loved. And So just hang, hang in

366
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.449
there for a bit. So, so this is one of the things that I want to do. And the second part, the second

367
00:51:10.459 --> 00:51:16.040
key that I want us to, that I want to share with you to develop a rich love is light, meaning

368
00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:22.270
understanding and wisdom. We know that plants need light to grow. Hey, if you look at your God,

369
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:28.270
without the sun, we cannot grow. So I also need light, no light. When it comes to the word means,

370
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.070
you know, when you say that, you know, just a light bulb went off in my head, that kind of light,

371
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.820
that illumination light is not just it, the word of God, it says by your word is the lamp unto my

372
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:45.429
feet and the light unto my path. In other words, God's guidance, God's truth, God's wisdom, God's

373
00:51:45.439 --> 00:51:52.250
ways, they are all light and without light, we cannot move forward. And God says, without vision,

374
00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:57.649
the people perish. And so often we, we know God's promises. I know that God loves me. I know that He

375
00:51:57.659 --> 00:52:02.449
wants this for me. But I don't understand the light. I don't understand how to get it. I don't

376
00:52:02.459 --> 00:52:08.800
understand process. I don't understand the ways of God, the principles and that is light. And so if

377
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:18.389
you look at what Paul says in Ephesians chapter one and 18, he says, I pray listen to this, that the

378
00:52:18.399 --> 00:52:28.000
light of God will illuminate your eyes of your heart. Ok? If you can do you have a passion or you

379
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.300
don't have passion version? If you do it, maybe you can change it to passion version. Um So

380
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:37.139
basically, it says that I pray that the eyes, he says that the eyes, meaning the eyes are the

381
00:52:37.149 --> 00:52:43.379
physical eyes of my heart would be enlightened so that I can see the depth and the riches of his

382
00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:50.479
calling. I found it so important that he speaks that my eyes must be flooded with light because it's

383
00:52:50.489 --> 00:52:55.379
asking us not just to see with the physical but also with the spiritual eyes. So for you to be able

384
00:52:55.389 --> 00:53:01.840
to move into greater effectiveness in your life, because a fruitful life is the life of influence is

385
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:07.179
a life of success, not just financial success, although that is part of that, but it's really a life

386
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:14.250
God is calling you and I He wants us to have impact in this world so desperately our world needs. We

387
00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:19.090
have the message people, we have the most important message of the kingdom. And so may we continue?

388
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.780
I hope that you're listening to me. Are you with me a bit quiet? Maybe you're just listening to me.

389
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.469
I feel my light, the lights, I don't see your faces. So I like to see people's eyes and and how they

390
00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:34.669
respond. But you know, he says, may the light and let's just pray that even right now, God may the

391
00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:40.550
light of my eyes, the understanding of my heart be opened, to understand the wealth that you've

392
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:47.830
given to me and to understand he says my place in God's in God's story. You know, one of the most

393
00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:54.800
discouraging thing for me is not to know my place in God's program. God is at work in the earth. Hey,

394
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.310
even if we don't see everything, he is, he's doing some extraordinary things. I'm in South African,

395
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.709
I've heard, you know, I'm telling you, I've seen New Testament working like the New Testament

396
00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:09.094
churches going up there in Africa, not only South Africa, Africa, but in a part of like in Nigeria,

397
00:54:09.104 --> 00:54:14.794
the western part of Africa that they see things that we don't see. And so God is at work. He's

398
00:54:14.804 --> 00:54:20.465
telling a new story, not a new story as far as his gospel, but he's at work. And I need to know what

399
00:54:20.475 --> 00:54:26.354
is God doing? What is my place in this program? And so may God give you that light and understanding.

400
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:32.169
The other verse that I have for us is that Ephesians five verse 13,

401
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.229
I don't know if you can if you have that. Well, I gave it to you, but maybe there's another verse

402
00:54:38.239 --> 00:54:45.030
that I have. Well, it is really fast. Ephesians five verses 13 says this and this is another verse

403
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:50.790
that I just read recently. He says, whatever revelation L light exposes. So when God exposes

404
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:56.000
something and says, I need you to grow in this area, it says, and everything that reveals truth is

405
00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:03.459
light to the soul. Everything that reveals that He exposes and he will correct is light. So light is

406
00:55:03.469 --> 00:55:08.750
not just what you see with your eyes like this. It's that understanding. And so I pray that God will

407
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.500
give us understanding hearts that He would, you would know God. What are you saying to me? Where do

408
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:18.449
I need to go in my life? What is in my heart, in my soul that I need to nurture that I need to

409
00:55:18.459 --> 00:55:23.899
remove? So [...] talk about rich soil. So as we move forward, this is light. So we

410
00:55:23.909 --> 00:55:29.544
need to become students. I want to encourage you like I'm encouraging myself to study again. If you've

411
00:55:29.554 --> 00:55:35.084
decided to go to school, just go. If you feel like you need to go write it maybe just a course on the

412
00:55:35.094 --> 00:55:40.594
youtube or whatever but don't do nothing. Just study, continue to, to equip yourself because that's

413
00:55:40.604 --> 00:55:47.449
how we're going to keep our relevance. Amen? Isaiah 29 verses 11. There's a beautiful verse that

414
00:55:47.459 --> 00:55:54.290
says, and I'm just gonna read it. You don't have to put it on, but it says unseal for me, maybe you

415
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.209
can put it on. I think you can put Nrv Isaiah 29 verses 11.

416
00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:08.850
Isaiah 29 verses. Is it for, for you? This whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll.

417
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:14.669
Isaiah had this vision and if you give the scroll to someone who can read and say read this please.

418
00:56:14.679 --> 00:56:20.639
They will answer. I cannot because it is sealed. Or if you give a scroll to someone who cannot read

419
00:56:20.649 --> 00:56:27.510
and say read this please. They will say, I don't know how to read. In other words, people I can give,

420
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:34.899
we can be given truth and the word of God often is a coded book. I know. Maybe I'm gonna, maybe you

421
00:56:34.909 --> 00:56:41.060
don't agree. But it's true. The word of God comes to us. But we need to have, we need God to give us

422
00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:49.070
eyes to see and to read every chapter. Every story in the Bible is going to talk about you. And one

423
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.290
of the things that I had to learn is there's something about my own life that is in this word and

424
00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:59.780
find your story in the Bible. So unless my eyes are open to see, I cannot understand. So that's what

425
00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:08.699
I want to leave with you. And so psalm 20 psalm one, it says, you know, it says meditate on my word

426
00:57:08.709 --> 00:57:15.439
day and night and you will be like a tree that is planted by the water, always bearing fruit in

427
00:57:15.449 --> 00:57:21.550
season and out of season. So light is also God's word. And this is where I just want to end with

428
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:27.000
this, this part. People I've discovered like even this last two years when I was doing some work

429
00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:31.870
with people, many people don't read their Bibles. Now, how can you not read your Bible if you're a

430
00:57:31.879 --> 00:57:37.399
kingdom person? And God is saying, I'm, you're my ambassador in this earth. I need you to represent

431
00:57:37.409 --> 00:57:42.790
me wherever you are in your home, in your school, in your business, you need to know the code, the

432
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.639
rule of engagement. So people, there are so many, so many great things in God's word and I want to

433
00:57:47.649 --> 00:57:53.689
encourage us as encouraging myself, even if it's one verse a day or two verses a week. But

434
00:57:53.699 --> 00:57:59.139
the word of God... Because you're gonna get bombarded with so many things in this world. And we see

435
00:57:59.149 --> 00:58:06.459
that is our anchor. The word of the Lord is our truth. It everything needs to be based whatever. So

436
00:58:06.469 --> 00:58:10.860
today I'm sharing a lot of scripture because I don't want to speak out of my heart, out of my mouth

437
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.709
stuff that I know is not connected to the word. The word of God is gonna help

438
00:58:15.719 --> 00:58:20.909
us. It will guide us. All right. And then the third point that I want to bring as I, as I just

439
00:58:20.919 --> 00:58:27.100
wanted two more is for me to have a heart that is rich. I need to be committed. Now, this is not the

440
00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:32.110
order that I'm giving you, I'm just giving all. But this is a very important one for me. You have to

441
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:36.820
be committed to your emotional health. We talk a lot about emotional well being emotional in a

442
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:43.800
mental health. But your mental wellness is important, your emotional world is important. And so

443
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:48.699
often we've been told, no emotions are not good people. You cannot be alive in your heart without

444
00:58:48.709 --> 00:58:53.870
emotions. And so whatever you're going through today and I know in a, in a place like this, there

445
00:58:53.879 --> 00:58:57.800
are people here that are happy, excited, but there are also people that are sad and feel lonely and

446
00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:04.439
feel confused. Embrace your emotions because your emotional world, your heart, that place because

447
00:59:04.449 --> 00:59:09.340
the heart is the seed, not only of your emotions, but also of your thoughts and those things, the

448
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:14.699
key because when you unlock the emotional part, that is the key to the heart of God. God can speak

449
00:59:14.709 --> 00:59:19.800
to us in our emotions. And so for so long, we have diminished it until the pandemic. And then

450
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:24.669
everyone now is speaking about mental health. Churches are preaching on, on, on wellness because

451
00:59:24.679 --> 00:59:32.300
this is God's heart for us. Jesus was a very emotional man. Just listen, listen to the G se when he

452
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:37.949
had to, when he was in a place where we had to obey God at the highest level. He said, I don't want

453
00:59:37.959 --> 00:59:42.239
to do this. I wish you could remove this cup from me. And then he says, you know, it was sweating

454
00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:46.709
blood and it was sad. And he said, father, why do you forgive? Why do you forsake me? But he said,

455
00:59:46.719 --> 00:59:52.250
but for this reason I came. So you see the tension. So even the things that are very important to us,

456
00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:57.409
even if it's a greater step of obedience, it will still take some pain but continue to be present to

457
00:59:57.419 --> 01:00:04.860
your heart. Your heart is important that those emotional, even when we for me a heart alive with you

458
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:10.449
angry with you. Sad is a heart that is alive but just embrace it and understand what's going on. So

459
01:00:10.459 --> 01:00:18.050
for me, Jesus is my, is a patter man. He's the one who can say yes, embrace it. Yes, I'm moving

460
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:24.149
forward and I can articulate. He didn't just say, OK, I'm just gonna privately said this is, this is,

461
01:00:24.159 --> 01:00:29.239
this is hard for me, God, this is not the way I thought it would be. And so I just want to encourage

462
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:33.810
us today, your emotional wellness and that's the whole series that we can talk on. But I just want

463
01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:41.129
to encourage you today that your health is important. II I call it more your, your emotional wealth,

464
01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:46.409
your emotional, not just mental because sometimes there's so much connotation around that. But God

465
01:00:46.419 --> 01:00:52.879
is interested in your emotions, right? I hope you can receive that today that God cares about your

466
01:00:52.889 --> 01:00:59.879
heart. All right. And then the fourth point that I have is that I think one of the most important

467
01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:07.179
things that you want to, that you want to have as a key is you need healthy relationships, healthy

468
01:01:07.189 --> 01:01:13.020
partnerships people who are aligned with you. People who can be your, they can have your back,

469
01:01:13.149 --> 01:01:17.500
especially those of you who are in leadership if you want to lead and if you want to create things,

470
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:22.419
you need people who can be in alignment with where you are going. If you don't know if they are not

471
01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:26.620
purpose partners, they are not going to take you in the right direction. And so even your friends,

472
01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:31.540
maybe today, you need to maybe look around your friendships or are the people that bring closer to

473
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:36.530
God that speaks life into me with the people who break down, break me down. And we can maybe bring

474
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:42.560
an end to those or bring redefine those relationships. But it's important that if we are going to be

475
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:47.389
people of rich soil, people are going to be bear much fruit, people are going to be effective, then

476
01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:53.820
we need to have people in our life that can stand with us, that can cry with us that can celebrate

477
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:59.699
with us and that can challenge us. Those are relationships that we need, we all need connection. Am

478
01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:04.790
I right? And if you don't have connection and if you're all by yourself, then you know how lonely

479
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.169
that is. And that is not the best version of who you are because we are created for relationships

480
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.300
and the absence of relationships is also painful. So I pray that God would enter in, make that in

481
01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:22.489
your life today. That he would bring you like those destiny partners, those purpose partners, those

482
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:28.379
people that can really, you know, see you in your becoming. I love Jesus stories because you always

483
01:02:28.389 --> 01:02:32.959
see people beyond where they were. And it's like a piece of gold. It's still going to start with a

484
01:02:32.969 --> 01:02:39.760
form of gold. You know, the the process of that fine gold in this, in his final product was not the

485
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:45.110
same in the first product. And so sometimes we see people and we don't see everything. But I pray

486
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:51.729
that you would have eyes to see the people in your life and cheer them on to become all right. So I

487
01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:56.560
pray that for us that as we cultivate that, that you would have half the relationships and that you

488
01:02:56.570 --> 01:03:02.459
would maybe just put some boundaries on those people who are not so good. John 15 verses 15, Jesus

489
01:03:02.469 --> 01:03:08.409
said you are my friends. He told his disciples you're not my servants anymore because he said no, I

490
01:03:08.419 --> 01:03:12.939
no longer call his servants because a servant does not know his boss's business. Instead, I've

491
01:03:12.949 --> 01:03:18.689
called you friends intimate ones for everything I learned from my father. I made known to you and

492
01:03:18.699 --> 01:03:23.389
this is who we are for God. He wants to talk to us. He wants to share his plan for this world for,

493
01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:28.439
for, for Canada, you know the Middle East, like all this stuff is happening for Africa. God wants to

494
01:03:28.449 --> 01:03:34.350
share with these people this is on my heart, but you need to come closer into my space into my heart

495
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.600
to hear that. And so connections is important. And the last part, the last point that I have for us

496
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:44.310
is that we need to have a healthy view. And this is just something I want to massage a bit more

497
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:53.010
people. We need to fall in love with God a fresh and we need to renew our passion for Him. Our

498
01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:58.780
hearts are always going to be uh hardened. If it's hardened, then it's not going to be full of

499
01:03:58.790 --> 01:03:59.870
passion for Jesus.

500
01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:08.320
You know, he wants, there's one thing that God is very like and he is awakening his emotions, it his

501
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:16.419
jealousy. He wants you. He wants your heart above everything else. He says, give me your heart and

502
01:04:16.429 --> 01:04:22.040
the thing that the enemy wants is your heart too. So when it's successful, we forget God. When we're

503
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:28.239
in trouble, we always cry out to God. But today, my dear friends, I want to ask you to come into a

504
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:34.330
holy place with God again to, to, to build authors of prayer where you can spend more time with Him,

505
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:39.290
not just 5, 10 minutes because you're not gonna move in the end time series that we're in right now

506
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.290
in the world, we're gonna need people of passion, people who love God, people who know their God.

507
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:50.939
And when we know their God, we can do exploits for God but if we don't know Him. And so Jesus, when

508
01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:57.719
it comes to John 15 is all about that. The fruitfulness being effective having rich song is

509
01:04:57.729 --> 01:05:03.199
connected to our intimacy with God. So that's why I took it from that angle. Your richness in your

510
01:05:03.209 --> 01:05:09.604
heart needs to be there because He wants us to have an intimate and a flourishing in a live

511
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:15.405
relationship with Him. So you can hear God, what are you saying to me? Who do, who I marry here? For

512
01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:20.044
all those who still need to be married, God, who is the person in my life that I need. What job do I

513
01:05:20.054 --> 01:05:25.004
need? What country do I need to leave? Do I need to stay? Do I need to build? Do I need to expand?

514
01:05:25.014 --> 01:05:30.185
Do I need to reduce? All those things God wants to speak to us about. We cannot do our own thing and

515
01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:35.344
then ask God to bless us after. So, but the big thing here is just let us really be awakened to the

516
01:05:35.354 --> 01:05:43.120
love of God and to who He is. And you know, God is a God who sees you today in a haggar in the Bible

517
01:05:43.129 --> 01:05:46.129
in Genesis. I'm not sure if I gave you the verse.

518
01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:54.570
But yeah, 16 verses 13. Haggar. Remember Haggar is a story. You know, there's a lot of complexities.

519
01:05:54.580 --> 01:06:00.199
Hey, we don't Abraham's complexity. Haggar then Ishmael, the Arab nation came out of Haggar and she,

520
01:06:00.209 --> 01:06:06.110
she gave his name to the Lord who spoke to her. You are the God who sees me for. For she said, I have

521
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:13.270
now seen the one who sees me and the word that we use is El Roi. And so I want to say to each one of

522
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:22.100
us that God sees you. God sees everything about you, even if no one else sees you. He sees you. And

523
01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:27.899
when we can come into a relationship with a God who is deeply for us and not against us and the

524
01:06:27.909 --> 01:06:33.280
circumstances in your life doesn't equate who God is. God's goodness is not dependent on whether God

525
01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:37.959
is gonna answer certain things or not. I live um Look here, I'm telling you, I've been like

526
01:06:37.969 --> 01:06:42.760
astonished just being in South Africa. And what I see there is like, how can they have such faith in

527
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:48.219
God? And the circumstances are so horrible but their hearts are fully alive. And I'm saying I was

528
01:06:48.229 --> 01:06:52.270
just sitting in one of those churches like a small church. I said, I'm gonna be undercover. They

529
01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.560
don't know who I am. They don't know that I was a pastor here in this church. I'm just gonna be

530
01:06:56.570 --> 01:07:03.239
undercover and I'm gonna be a student of their environment. The people here, the guns and they, they,

531
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.889
they're in a difficult situation, there's poverty. But those people, when they start praying, the

532
01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:13.850
roof comes down and you just feel like God is in this place, but there's something that we should

533
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:19.510
take for granted in the western world because sometimes we just determine the goodness of God when

534
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:26.649
it comes to our comfort. But so may God fully set us on fire again inside of us by the power of His

535
01:07:26.659 --> 01:07:33.159
spirit, seek after Him, make space for God. Don't give him scraps, don't give him like just crumbs.

536
01:07:33.169 --> 01:07:38.020
Give him the whole, give him the whole bank with your time, spend time with God on a daily basis,

537
01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:44.520
very deeply with Him. I'm saying this um this is a charge for us because God, we, we need you. All

538
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:50.399
of your voices are needed today. I cannot do what you do. And if you, if your heart is hard and if

539
01:07:50.409 --> 01:07:56.479
you don't develop rich soil in all these places, you won't be able to do all that we call to do. So

540
01:07:56.489 --> 01:08:03.120
that's why we come to places like this to be encouraged and to be challenged. Amen. And so, so, so

541
01:08:03.129 --> 01:08:07.760
my last closure that I want to talk about is I want to talk about the awaken to be released and to

542
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:14.219
be awakened. And I'm just gonna start coming to my close. Um There's a beautiful story and song of

543
01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:21.549
Solomon's verses four verses 16. If you have, I'm gonna just read it to you if I don't have it. One

544
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:27.370
of the things that I believe and I just want to continue is that we cannot do everything on our own,

545
01:08:28.009 --> 01:08:35.200
the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit needs to breathe upon us. The breath of God needs to breathe upon

546
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:41.508
us. And in, in songs of Solomon chapter, can you give that to me? I don't think I gave it to you.

547
01:08:41.519 --> 01:08:47.929
But the song of Solomon chapter 4, 16 to 17. Song of Solomon uses the image of a woman and he says, he

548
01:08:47.938 --> 01:08:54.229
says, you are like an enclosed garden. Remember your soil, think of your heart as a garden, your

549
01:08:54.238 --> 01:09:01.549
garden is closed, the fountain and the fountain of your springs are locked up. Everything is closed

550
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:10.589
and con and concealed. And then he says, but awaken the wind awaken the spirit blow on my garden so

551
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.439
that all the beautiful spices and all the beautiful things in this garden will be unleashed for the

552
01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:21.970
people blow on my garden so that we can be free and be and become. And so I want to use that verse

553
01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:28.529
as today to say, Holy Spirit come breathe upon us. You know, you remember we talk about so remember

554
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:34.100
how we were created out of the soil of the earth and the very breath of God would breathe upon us.

555
01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:39.709
And that's how we became a living being. And so may the spirit of God again breathe upon each one of

556
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:47.209
us, the garden of your heart inside. And may He revive us and re resurrect us and bring out the

557
01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:53.959
beauty that is us. So the spirit of God can breathe upon us and unleash the beauty, the potential

558
01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:59.259
and the life that God wants. So it's not just remember we talk about weeds, but I want to say to us

559
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:05.770
that there are also things in your life that is untapped that you don't even know yet is there. But

560
01:10:05.779 --> 01:10:11.450
God can unleash it when he breathes upon us. And sometimes the hard and hard or the weeds cover

561
01:10:11.459 --> 01:10:17.229
those things. And may God continue to heal and restore so he can bring upon us and bring you call

562
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.640
you forth into the beauty into the persons and into the potential that God has for you. This is,

563
01:10:22.649 --> 01:10:28.029
this is the gospel, really. This is a story of word, God can restore us with speed. I do believe

564
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:32.810
with that. I honestly believe sometimes I feel like the time is against us. But the kingdom

565
01:10:32.819 --> 01:10:39.029
advantage that you have today is that whatever that whatever you've lost time that you've lost. God

566
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:45.359
can give it back to you. I hope you can believe that He can squeeze seven years into one year. And

567
01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:49.759
he said in His word, he can squeeze time. So in other words, God can give you a speed. I'm gonna

568
01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:55.589
pray that for us that God will give us speed of restoration, that where we have felt regret, or we

569
01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.759
feel like we've wasted our time today to God. Just bring it all back together and push me into the

570
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:06.399
future where I need to go is, I'm a, I'm a restorer. I restore the years that has been been been

571
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:13.310
lost so God can do that. So I pray that as you look at your own heart today, may you be able to see

572
01:11:13.319 --> 01:11:17.709
the things that you need the nutrients? Like I talked about the five points, you know, the love in

573
01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:23.520
your relationships, the restoration. You know, all those connections that we need, the love and may

574
01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:29.055
those soil become so fertile that you would come and go into the world and produce that food. But I

575
01:11:29.064 --> 01:11:33.625
also want to say to you that there are places in your heart that you still need to know that God

576
01:11:33.634 --> 01:11:39.185
wants to unlock some of us. And I speak that for myself because sometimes we keep people away from

577
01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:44.555
us. We we, we protect our gardens can be enclosed. But God says, I want you to open your garden and

578
01:11:44.564 --> 01:11:50.390
let other people in to the things that we need of. You. May the beauty be unlocked in your heart?

579
01:11:50.729 --> 01:11:55.299
Amen. And so I'm gonna call the worship team because I'm gonna allow, I'm gonna pray with us for a

580
01:11:55.310 --> 01:12:01.109
few free pray prayer points and, and can you invite us to stand and they're gonna sing, maybe play

581
01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:09.120
the music while we just invite us to stand as we respond to him. And um I want to speak to us a

582
01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:13.839
little bit about that. I'm gonna pray now, you can either say amen. Or you can say it in the

583
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:16.310
quietest of your heart, you can say what you need to say.

584
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:25.830
So maybe you can place, I don't know, the worship team is coming, the worship team, maybe the

585
01:12:25.839 --> 01:12:30.620
musicians can come and maybe just pray something for me. Uh If you are there. So what I want, what I

586
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:35.430
want to just encourage us, you know, for those of you who maybe came into the space and you don't

587
01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:39.470
really know all about Jesus, what I talked to you about. And I always believe the greatest decision

588
01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:45.140
that you can make today is to give Jesus access to your life to Jesus. I give you access Jesus, I

589
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:50.529
give you control, come into my life and move me forward. And I just want you to make, if you make

590
01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.200
that decision, I just want to pray that for you, that God would continue to say Jesus come into my

591
01:12:55.209 --> 01:13:00.160
heart, come into my life. I give you access, I give you control. And if this is your prayer, then I

592
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:04.700
would like us to come, you know, later, you know, you can speak to one of the prayer, prayer leaders.

593
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:10.979
Um You can see you can play something if you want. Um And then OK, am I putting you on the spot? OK.

594
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:17.629
Don't worry, don't, no pressure. Um One of the things that I want to pray for us as a God and I'm

595
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.580
gonna pray and I just want you can feel free. I know some of you maybe don't feel comfortable with

596
01:13:21.589 --> 01:13:25.470
this. I'm gonna pray and you can just say amen. OK. How about that? Ok.

597
01:13:29.379 --> 01:13:34.830
So father today as we come into your presence, as we come into the space that is yours that you've

598
01:13:34.839 --> 01:13:40.100
created for us, I pray that you would unlock our hearts and that your wind would flow over us and

599
01:13:40.109 --> 01:13:45.439
that you will unlock the beauty that we don't even see that your spirit would blow and flow into our

600
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:55.410
hearts so that we can have the eyes to see what you have in us. Amen. Amen. Amen. And so father, I

601
01:13:55.419 --> 01:14:00.759
pray that you would also restore the things that were taken away from us, things that we may be by

602
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:05.430
our own negligence. I pray that you would restore the very things and the years maybe that we have

603
01:14:05.439 --> 01:14:11.109
lost that we feel the time is against us. But thank you for the gift of restoration. Thank you for

604
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.859
the speed of restoration. I pray that you would just restore to us, whatever has been broken,

605
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:22.890
whatever needs to be healed in Jesus name and people says amen. And so father, I pray that you would

606
01:14:22.899 --> 01:14:29.490
give each one of us a sensitivity to your voice. I pray that we would, each of us may find what is

607
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.569
our place in your, in the program that you're doing right now. May we all find it and may we all

608
01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:39.529
walk in with confidence and with assurance and whatever is against that, I pray that you would break

609
01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:44.560
that so that we can all be free to become and become the versions of who we are that you've created

610
01:14:44.569 --> 01:14:50.220
us to be. And all the people of the Lord says, amen. And father, I pray that you would bless the

611
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:55.229
work of our hands, bless the work of our minds. I pray that you would give us sharp minds. I pray

612
01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.319
that you would give us intelligence, that is superior so that we can truly understand, have that

613
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:06.950
light so that we can understand your word eyes, to see hearts, to hear what you have for us. In the

614
01:15:06.959 --> 01:15:12.479
name of Jesus, the people of the Lord says amen. And so father, I pray for whatever they need,

615
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:18.330
whatever needs there are in this room today, whatever pain, whatever disappointment, whatever grief,

616
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:25.540
whatever Brokenness there is. I pray by your life, love, I pray that he would heal and in your mercy

617
01:15:25.549 --> 01:15:31.490
that he would restore us in the name of Jesus. And the people of the Lord says amen as the father

618
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:38.560
now has received your word, I pray that you will now come and Holy Spirit that you be the one who

619
01:15:38.569 --> 01:15:44.240
can seal for us. I thank you that you love us deeply. And father, we decree and declare today that

620
01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:49.790
we will be rich soil that we will stay rooted in your love and that we would be open to your words

621
01:15:49.799 --> 01:15:54.700
and that we would be open to your word and that you will give us an understanding heart and that you

622
01:15:54.709 --> 01:16:00.279
would restore to us and that we would be revived in our passion for you. So we can go forth into

623
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:05.740
this world, into our families, our workspaces today, tomorrow, and this week and into this world that we

624
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:13.410
would bring light and salt and hope in the name of Jesus and for your glory alone. Amen. Amen. God
