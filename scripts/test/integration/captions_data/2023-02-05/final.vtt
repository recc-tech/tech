WEBVTT

29
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.310
I went out, I was getting ready to go to the gym. I had willed myself to do it and my battery was

30
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:07.050
dead. So I called an Uber and I still went not today, Satan, that's what I was saying. So, um

31
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.290
welcome again. We're so glad that you're here with us. We have a great service to put on for you

32
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:20.800

33
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.860

37
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:58.310

57
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.760
So glad you're here in the house of the Lord. We're gonna continue with another song from Mosaic.

88
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:28.720
I'm back. Thank you. Worship team. If we weren't warm before we're warm now, right?

89
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:41.420
We're so blessed to have them. So first announcement, the community hall fundraiser, so we've

90
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.630
raised a little bit more money towards our goal. We are currently at

91
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:57.780
$13,990. Thank you so much for your generosity. We're doing amazing. Collectively, we're gonna ask

92
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:04.460
for a little bit more, a little bit more guys, we can do it together. Can we reach the 15,000 for

93
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:12.620
next week? Valid? Cool. Um For you that aren't familiar with the community hall down stay. I

94
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:21.660
remember before the flood, we had classes there, we had community dinners, their community kitchen

95
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:28.080
was held down there. So it's a wonderful versatile space um that really opens up what we can do and

96
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.980
the outreach for our community. So it really is an important fundraiser for us guys. So if you can

97
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:40.000
all band together, there are people that can benefit from it. Um Community kitchen brunch. So

98
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.460
speaking of community kitchen, February 19th, we're having a brunch here for everyone in the

99
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.830
community and those even outside of the community. So it's a time to come together have some

100
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:58.200
fantastic food fellowship, meet some people that you haven't met before. Um We're gonna ask if you

101
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:05.430
have any extra clothes at home or any extra groceries that you can bring them next week so

102
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:11.330
that we can prepare everything outside in the vestibule for those who need on February 19. And we

103
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.500
will remind you next week about that. So community kitchen branch for us and that's an amazing

104
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:24.390
blessing as well. Kids and youth ministry. First up, if you do have babies, the nursery is open

105
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:32.670
today, so you can leave your youngest um in the annex and they will be watched during the service if

106
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:38.920
you'd like to have a little break this morning. Um Again, we have a new coordinator for the Youth

107
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:46.490
Ministry, Thalita. We're so thankful for her. She is still in need of some hands guys. We need a

108
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:51.020
little bit of help for her so that she doesn't burn out and that the other teachers are feeling

109
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.380
supported. It is on a rotational basis. So if you are all in declined to do a little bit of teaching,

110
00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:01.950
all of the materials are provided for you and Thalita could really use your help. So she'll be at the

111
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:08.140
back after the service and there's also youth sign up. So if you're interested in enrolling your

112
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:15.190
kids in the youth ministry that is also available at the back at the end of the service, we have

113
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.190
four ways to give here at River's Edge and we just encourage you to use whatever is convenient for

114
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:28.190
you. Any little amount, helps us, helps the community outside because there are ministries in place

115
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:35.290
and we want to be able to provide for you and for those who need outside of this direct community.

116
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:42.980
So there are four ways to give and we can dismiss the kids. It's time for you to go to class. So

117
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:48.360
let's prepare our hearts again. Pastor Lorenzo is coming out and we're gonna start the sermon

118
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.710
becoming the one

119
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:05.180
I believe you're here. I mean, that's amazing the way things have been going this past week. For

120
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:12.430
sure. I thought it's just gonna be me. I didn't even know if the worship team is gonna show up, but

121
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.330
I'm so glad that you're here. Welcome. Are you guys? Okay? I know it's a little colder than usual in

122
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:24.790
here. Uh, this building is just really difficult to keep warm, but on most days it's pretty good,

123
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:31.830
but on these cold snaps, I mean, I mean, it just, it just, it just can't be done. So, but we're glad

124
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:37.660
that, uh, you guys have your coats on and, uh, and you know, the good thing about sitting with

125
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.160
someone else in the aisle, you can also get to know them a little bit better. I mean, just ask

126
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:51.790
permission first. Uh, so I am so glad that we can start this new series called Becoming the one and

127
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:57.990
I really think that we're gonna have a great, great series. And the talk that we're going to begin

128
00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:04.490
with is, is coming in a strange place in the scriptures. It's actually gonna start in a place called

129
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:12.720
Jose and Jose A was a prophet who was given a very hard mission according to him and what he needed

130
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.300
to do. And we're gonna take a look at this passage as today, we are going to talk about the one for

131
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:25.430
me. And this is an important topic for us because I think that all of us in one way or another,

132
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:32.690
think about this struggle with this are trying to make a choice about this or maybe even rethinking

133
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:41.070
or choice about who we may be with. And as a result, there are some things that we need to look at.

134
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.520
I believe that God provides wisdom in all areas of our life and this is one of them as well. And I

135
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:53.580
want us to take an open mind and an open heart approach to what we're about to hear together and,

136
00:25:53.590 --> 00:26:01.390
and see what it is that God is speaking to us about in particular. And so today, as we begin in Jose,

137
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:07.410
a chapter one, we're just going to read two verses. And the reason why these two verses are a

138
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:17.600
strange place to begin with in a relationship series is because it's not a good relationship, it's

139
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:26.300
not a healthy relationship, it's not a choice that either one of them would have made. It's

140
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:36.560
kind of circumstances and God pushing them and directing them to go in each other's direction. It's

141
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:45.080
a commandment that actually comes from God to Jose about who He needs to choose and the reasons for

142
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:53.310
it are not for love. It's not even something that can be described as an arranged marriage by the

143
00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:02.440
parents, but it's all about illustrating how God is trying to make a point about how his people are

144
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:10.400
unfaithful to him, how they don't know how to live up rightly before him. And so he wants to make

145
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:19.170
Joseon a living breathing example of what his relationship looks like with his own people, Israel.

146
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:25.500
And so the story begins in Jose a chapter one and then in verses two and three are the ones that

147
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:31.830
we're gonna look at in particular. And it says that when the Lord first began speaking to Israel

148
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:39.490
through Jose, he then said to him, I want you to go and marry a prostitute. Now, it wasn't just any

149
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:47.700
prostitute. It was a temple prostitute, which meant that her purpose was to have acts of sexuality

150
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:55.480
and fertility before a God or gods in this particular temple. And so she was someone of a different

151
00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:04.380
faith and someone of a different religion, someone of a different idolatry than what Hosea was used

152
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:12.830
to. So God asks him to go and to find someone who was completely different than himself in every way.

153
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:20.520
And God wants to drive home this point. And then he says, so that some of her children will be

154
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.890
conceived in prostitution, which tells us that right from the start, Jose is not going to know if

155
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:35.140
he's the father, he's not going to know if the person that he has married is able to give him the

156
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:43.380
guarantee that these are his Children because of what she continues to do at the temple by running

157
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:50.440
away from Joseon and the marriage relationship in which they were called into making a covenant to

158
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:57.960
one another. And this illustrates how Israel has acted. God says like a prostitute by turning

159
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.750
against the Lord and then worshiping other gods. And so Jose goes and he marries Gomer, the daughter

160
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:14.830
of the problem and she became pregnant and she gave Jose a son. Now, isn't this a great story for

161
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:21.810
relationship series? It's exactly where you would have started, right? But you know, this is a

162
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.170
different kind of church, right? And you know, when you come here, you're gonna hear a different

163
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:32.150
kind of story and message and examples from the scripture, things that people don't like to talk

164
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:39.150
about. And so what's interesting about this story is that for us, if we're single, married,

165
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:46.470
separated, one of divorce, happy or unhappy with Children, if we're looking for love in the wrong

166
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:55.100
places and we're looking for love with the wrong people, we can relate with all of this. It makes

167
00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:06.330
sense because the story of when you're someone like Hosea, or if you're someone like Gomer, you may

168
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:18.050
identify with one or the other more. But here's the truth. They're both sinners. No one of them is

169
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:25.410
good enough. And we will automatically look at home at, at, I was gonna say Homer, I'm just adding

170
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:37.490
names to the story. I just combined Jose and Gomer and gave them a celebrity name, Homer. Uh But

171
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:46.480
basically these two characters, neither one of them is good enough for each other and neither one of

172
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:54.270
them is, is right in the eyes of God. If Jose was better, he wouldn't tell Jose to marry someone

173
00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:01.340
like Gomer and Gomer was any better, then she wouldn't want to be with someone like Jose to either.

174
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:14.260
And so the truth of the story is this is that you are also an imperfect, broken person. You are also

175
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:21.780
someone who falls short who the the scriptures describe as someone who is a sinner that is going to

176
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:31.230
date, make commitments that you are not going to follow up on and maybe marry someone by being

177
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:38.490
imperfect or marrying someone who's just as imperfect, broken and sinful as you are or possibly

178
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:49.640
worse. And that's the truth. You see no one in the story marries Jesus who is the only perfect

179
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:58.450
person, you only marry someone or be in a relationship with someone who's imperfect. And so if we're

180
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:05.090
going out there looking for Jesus. We're doing the right thing, but you can't marry him. You can't

181
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.240
be in a relationship with Jesus. That way

182
00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:20.450
you can't find everything in an imperfect, broken sinful person.

183
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.170
You just can't.

184
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:33.930
And so we asked this question and we asked this question all the time and I hear it all the time.

185
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.760
How do I know that they are the one for me?

186
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:53.080
How do I know that they are the one for me? And here's the problem with this question. It's the

187
00:32:53.080 --> 00:33:01.800
wrong question. In fact, if you ask this question, you need to stop asking this question because

188
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:11.640
what this question does is that it puts you at the center of the process and you are not supposed to

189
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.750
be at the center of the process.

190
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.260
God is

191
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:27.960
Jesus is at the center of the process. And if you are single or somewhere in between, if you're

192
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:34.100
married or rethinking that you need to understand that what happens when you were at the center of

193
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:40.850
the process. This is what you keep doing when you ask the question is this person the one for me.

194
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:49.050
This is what you do. You say this is a person who is no longer meeting my needs. This is a person

195
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:58.900
who no longer fits my personality. This is a person who isn't satisfying my desires. See you put

196
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:08.630
yourself at the center of the relationship and then you say this person has to meet my needs. This

197
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:17.110
person has to fit my personality and they must satisfy all my desires because if they don't, then

198
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.050
they can't be the one for me.

199
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:24.230
Anybody here. A window shopper.

200
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.590
Yeah. Like you just walked through things, just walk through places and just take a look and just

201
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:36.900
see, don't actually buy anything. Sometimes you do keep the tags on and return them. Ever do that.

202
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:45.120
Sometimes that's what we do. We just kind of like, just don't want to commit. Right. So we're kind

203
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:55.190
of always like window shopping. Any, anyone here, a big fan of, of like all you can eat buffets. I

204
00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:04.380
know I am. It's part of my problem. One of them anyways, if I can be honest. And I went on vacation

205
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:09.020
with my brother not long ago, just taking some time off. He had gone through some, some things and

206
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:13.180
took him away. We went to Florida, we just wanted to spend time with each other and we spent a lot

207
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:19.660
of time with buffets instead. And, uh, and while we were there, I just remembered my visits with my

208
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:26.130
health nutritionists and I had, you know, paid good money to get good advice on, on what not to do.

209
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:34.100
And, and, and I, and as I found myself, you know, at this buffet, I found myself just, um, you know,

210
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:37.040
fulfilling the science of picking out.

211
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:46.160
I had, I had perfected this years before and I had stepped away from it but now that I was in

212
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:53.900
Florida and it's, it's really hard when you pass a Golden Corral and you don't stop. It's, there's,

213
00:35:53.900 --> 00:36:00.050
there's this impulse to, to just do that, not the best food in the world, but it's like, you know,

214
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.060
it's like cheap and there's lots of it. And the thing about it is that I found myself that I was

215
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:12.800
actually sitting at a table because getting into a booth would mean it would be a lot harder to get

216
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.580
out.

217
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:24.670
Thanks. I realized that that even while I was eating and I'm meeting with another person instead of

218
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.410
facing my brother, I chose to face the buffet. Instead

219
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:41.030
it was more important for me to see the food than to see my own flesh and blood. And I realized that

220
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:50.640
I began to serve myself without even serving the and surveying the entire buffet. I didn't care what

221
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:57.420
was there. I just saw what was in front of me and I began to fill my plate. I picked the largest

222
00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:04.450
plate. I could not a small one. I made sure that I fit as much as I could on top of it. I use the

223
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.190
fork instead of chopsticks.

224
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:18.740
I made sure that my napkin was not on my lap, but it was tucked into my shirt. I was giving all the

225
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:27.080
signs that I was not going to leave any food on my plate and I was chewing as fast as I could

226
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:34.040
instead of taking my time. So my brain could never tell my body that it was full. You see, when we

227
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:41.450
do these things, we don't realize. But when we are window shopping, we are consuming. When we are at

228
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:50.480
a buffet, we are consuming. We are not living our life thinking intentionally and with precision, we

229
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:59.360
are not living a life of discipline, but one that is led by the passions of our desires. And when we

230
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:08.730
allow ourselves to be led that way, here's what happens in these scenarios. We are all unexamined,

231
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.090
unquestioned and we are unassailable

232
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:26.480
because when you never stop to consider who you are, then all you ever do is consider who the person

233
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:34.060
is not. The problem isn't that there are too many places to shop at or that there are too many

234
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:44.070
buffets. It is my life in those spaces and how I am living in those spaces and interacting with

235
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:53.980
those spaces that tells me that there is something wrong, not with what I'm seeing or even what I am

236
00:38:53.980 --> 00:39:06.250
doing. But who I am instead, I want you to understand that our unexamined expectations for a future

237
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:13.890
spouse are gonna be twisted by our own sinful nature. I cannot trust what I want. I cannot trust

238
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:20.470
what I need. And what we've done in our culture, especially since the 60s and 70s is that we have a

239
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:26.740
dating culture in which we feel that we are gonna get to know what we want and what we need by

240
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:34.430
dating as many people as possible. And so we have entered into a buffet mentality thinking that that

241
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:40.950
is how it's going to satisfy us. That is how it's going to instruct us. That is how it is going to

242
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:47.400
inform us that is how it's going to fulfill us. Because when we've done that enough times, we're

243
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:55.050
eventually going to find that, which is perfect for us. The problem with this is that we are just

244
00:39:55.050 --> 00:40:04.200
consumers. And in that perspective, there is going to be no woman or man who will ever meet up to

245
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:12.880
our twisted standards because our standards in and of themselves are only based on something that

246
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:20.310
comes from ourselves and because it comes from ourselves and it doesn't come from anywhere else that

247
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:31.230
is higher than our own, uninformed, limited opinions of what we truly need, then we are going to

248
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:40.230
keep making terrible mistakes. And so my question then becomes to all of you. If it's the wrong

249
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:46.660
question to ask, is this the right person for me? Then what is the right question to ask? And I'm

250
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:54.150
gonna say, let's start with a different question. Ask yourself, am I the type of person someone

251
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.710
wants to marry or stay married to?

252
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.430
Am I the type of person

253
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.520
that

254
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:22.620
is good enough for what that other person needs and my becoming that person?

255
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:31.690
Am I working on doing everything to become that person or am I just expecting that person to become

256
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:39.210
everything that they need to become for me? You see if we don't ask this question and if we don't

257
00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:47.640
live now in the direction of what this question brings to each of us, then you're going to see

258
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:53.630
yourself making mistake after mistake, after mistake. Because what you wanna do is you want to

259
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:59.370
remove yourself from the center of the process and you wanna put your character at the center of the

260
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.640
process. Instead,

261
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:14.630
what you want to do is you want to say this, I want to spend less time evaluating others around me

262
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.660
and I want to spend more time developing the character of Jesus within me.

263
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:30.500
I want to stop pointing out what it is that this person doesn't bring to the table. And I want to be

264
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.460
what that person needs. When we come to the table,

265
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:46.120
ask yourself what sort of qualities should I be looking for? When you think about the qualities that

266
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:52.420
you want in another person, then what you are doing in essence is saying these qualities are so

267
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.230
important for me to find in someone else that these are the ones that I'm actually working on myself.

268
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:04.140
But these are the ones that I've prioritized in my own life. These are the things that I've put

269
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:10.270
before other things because I believe that these are the things that are going to not only make me

270
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:18.570
the best person, another person needs but it's just gonna make me the best person possible. I wanna

271
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:25.790
be the person that another person needs by being the person I always wanted to become. The person who

272
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:34.210
is fulfilled without another person, the person who lives and fulfills their mandate and purpose in

273
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:40.630
this life by working on themselves to such a degree that when other people see us, they're just

274
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:47.500
drawn to us and they want to be with us and they want the characteristics that we are displaying

275
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:54.330
because we have stopped putting ourselves at the center and we have put Jesus there instead. You

276
00:43:54.330 --> 00:44:00.500
see, when we do these things, we begin to understand what are those qualities. And, you know, in a

277
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.180
lot of places in the scriptures, I'm gonna put some up on the screen here. If you're not sure where

278
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:10.670
to start or where to spend time or where to look or where to check, there's a lot of places that

279
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:17.160
tell us what it looks like to have, the things that God wants us to have. So we can become the one

280
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:24.050
like those characteristics that are so important that we sometimes neglect. And the powerful thing

281
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:29.530
about the scriptures is that it describes things in a manner that we all get and some of these

282
00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:34.940
things, they end up getting repeated, you know, like the characteristics that are found in, in, in

283
00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:41.530
first Titus. Uh and, and, and, and then in First Timothy, they're, they're kind of the same, but

284
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:47.430
they're said in a different way and they sometimes shine a different light on the same topic, but

285
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:53.590
they kind of express it in a different way for us to understand what it looks like for us to live

286
00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:00.710
for God and to be a person who reflects God in there every day. And so I just want to read some of

287
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:07.840
it, it says, you know, don't get involved in foolish and ignorant arguments that only starts fights,

288
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:16.030
that doesn't that always happen in relationships. And so what I would say, I don't want to be the

289
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:22.560
person who's talks foolishly. I don't want to be the person who starts arguments. I would be the

290
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.680
person who ends them, not by walking out,

291
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:34.020
but by not starting them in the first place by bringing us to a place of reason of discussion of, of

292
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:40.290
honesty and authenticity and sincerity, a place where we can open up our minds and our hearts and

293
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:45.660
reveal what it is that we are really going through. And even if we can't articulate it, well, here's

294
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.720
the thing. We're not going to articulate it with a temper.

295
00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:59.060
We're gonna do it with kindness and goodness and love. We're gonna do it in patience. And when we

296
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:05.020
begin to realize that the scriptures are just full of this kind of advice, it then says like when

297
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:15.730
you interact with, with others, I want you to oppose those who oppose the truth. And so there's

298
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.970
gonna be moments when we're, we're not going to be honest, we're not going to be truthful in our

299
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:27.650
relationships. We're not gonna want to go there. And you know what? Your instincts about that person

300
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:30.670
lying are generally 100%. Right.

301
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:40.120
If you think they're not telling you everything, it's because they're not, you are not that dumb.

302
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:50.230
The only thing you can't do is make them talk. You can't get them to open up and tell you the truth.

303
00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:55.920
You can't get them to always say what's on their mind and their heart because maybe the space just

304
00:46:55.930 --> 00:47:05.010
isn't truthful enough to receive it. And maybe it's just not safe enough to give it because a little

305
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:11.940
more information can sometimes be the determining factor if a person stays or goes. And so we choose

306
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:18.960
a place of untruth instead of speaking the truth because we'd rather hold onto the relationship of a

307
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:24.780
lie, then get to a place where it's healthy and truth is being revealed.

308
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:37.990
And so we live out the line and we lived the burden of the lion. We live this out every day because

309
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:46.130
we would rather hold on to the lie then experience the truth that can truly transform the

310
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:53.760
relationship. And God is wanting to transform us so that whatever relationship we get into or

311
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.440
whatever relationship we're already in can also be transformed. Sometimes we're not gonna have the

312
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:06.610
participation that we need and we desire. But that is where we pray for the person that we are with.

313
00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:13.540
That is where we let God do a work and reach places of a life and a heart and a mind that we cannot

314
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:19.510
reach. That is where you believe that God is more powerful. That if something is hidden, you ask God

315
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.560
to reveal it

316
00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:31.590
that if something is sinful, you ask God to heal it, that if something is broken, you ask God to

317
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:41.260
restore it, that if something is missing, you ask God to find it. You see, you don't just point out

318
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:48.940
what is wrong. But you pray with the person to get to a place where you now are revealing the

319
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:56.930
characteristics of what Jesus does with us. Thank God. Jesus does not kick us out of our

320
00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:04.050
relationship. Thank God that he doesn't give up on us when we say the wrong thing, we've done the

321
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:09.080
wrong thing, have thought the wrong thing, and have lived out the wrong thing. Thank God that He keeps

322
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:15.850
taking us back and restoring us and leading us to a healthier place. I know we need people to change

323
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:21.600
around us. I know we need them to be better for us. I'm not saying except the crap the way it is.

324
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:31.150
But you also need to have that person's commitment that you are going to go and face this with the

325
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:35.550
Lord together. And sometimes you just don't have that.

326
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:42.500
And I've seen what happens when, when that's the case. It's really hard to go forward when you're

327
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:49.300
not on the same page when you're not committed to the same God when you're not living right together?

328
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:58.360
But is there a place where you can start so that, that can become the new pattern in your life? Is

329
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:04.460
there something that you can do together that that person is willing to do? Maybe it's just go to

330
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:10.930
church together. Maybe it's just pray together, maybe it's bless a meal together. Maybe it's have a

331
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:17.070
spiritual conversation about touts and, and what we're skeptical about, maybe it's about being

332
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:24.020
honest about our Brokenness and, and asking that person for the help that we need. And so the Bible

333
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:32.010
is encouraging us, ask the right questions and then becomes someone who fits the description of a

334
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:39.570
Godly man and woman become the person that God wants you to become regardless of the other person.

335
00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:46.860
This is not about what the other person is or isn't. It's about you. Are you becoming the person

336
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:52.570
that God wants you to be? And here's what happens when you become the person that God wants you to

337
00:50:52.570 --> 00:51:00.200
be. When you display those characteristics, it transforms the lives of those around you. It affects

338
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:07.100
them, it impacts them, it has more influence than you realize what? Because it's the very presence

339
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:13.720
of God. God says that when you have someone who is an unbeliever in your own family, in your own

340
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:20.980
household, that when you pray for them that through your character, you can actually lead a person

341
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:28.250
back to God. Now, if you don't believe in that promise, it's okay. Don't believe in it. That's your

342
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:36.700
choice. But the promise is there. And God says that if you focus on my relationship with you, if you

343
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:43.950
focus on a relationship with God, if you focus on having the Godly character that I need you to have,

344
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:52.370
that is what is going to lead that person back to me. If you believe that, it'll happen. Because God

345
00:51:52.370 --> 00:52:00.190
has promised it, but you've got to act on it. And so with all these characteristics are describing

346
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:08.340
the ones that we saw earlier, the ones that talk about what it looks like to be a Godly person like

347
00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:18.670
those verses In Proverbs 31 in 1st Peter three in Ephesians five and verse 22 and 23 when you read

348
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:27.560
through these lists and I want you to read through them. That's why I put them there. I want you to

349
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:33.850
look and see what it says. Do you know that? At the end of first Peter chapter three in verse seven,

350
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:42.730
it talks, it talks to the men and you know what it says? It says that if you don't treat the woman

351
00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:48.170
in your life, right, God will not hear your prayers

352
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.740
that if you don't treat the person that you're in a relationship with correctly, your prayers are

353
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:07.610
blocked. That's, that's unbelievable. To me because the way I look at it is that my parents are

354
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:15.360
never blocked. I can pretty much go through this entire life, do whatever I want, say whatever I

355
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:20.520
want without pretty much any consequences because God is a loving God and He will always take me

356
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:27.960
back no matter what. But do you want God to just take you back or do you want God to transform you

357
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:37.360
and help you to become everything that He has purpose and destined you to be? Do you want to just

358
00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:45.520
experience grace or do you want to live his favor on your life? Do you want him to just be merciful

359
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:51.460
and compassionate and give you His forgiveness whenever you ask for it? Or do you want to see

360
00:53:51.470 --> 00:54:02.660
blessing after blessing and it overflow to the point where it overshadows any of the bad and the

361
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:10.920
loss and anything in the past that has been taken from you that the abundance that God has for you

362
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:18.590
today is more and greater than anything you could have ever imagined. You got to say, I don't want

363
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:28.260
you to just have this. I want you to have this and what he calls it in John 1010 is the abundant

364
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.920
life. That's what he is describing.

365
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.380
And so stop searching for the one

366
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:45.960
and let's make a commitment to become the one instead. Can I hear an amen?

367
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:57.890
Stop searching for the one And let's start becoming the one and whatever situation that we're in,

368
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:05.590
that is what we are called to do. God will help us with the next steps. God will show us what we

369
00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:12.200
need to do next. He's not gonna just tell you to work on yourself and become something better and

370
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:17.210
more and I know what that may sound like for many of us that were already not feeling like we're

371
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:23.170
good enough. We're feeling the Brokenness of, of, of past relationships and all the things and the

372
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:28.470
faults that people have found in us and have described to us and the reasons why they've given to us

373
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.050
for the reason why they can't be with us and we, we can take all of that and we can listen to it.

374
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:40.650
But I'm telling you that if you, if you listen to that more than to the description of what it looks

375
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:47.350
like to become the one in this book, then you will never get that abundant blessing that God is

376
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:52.740
wanting to give you. You will never become the one by listening to someone else's criticism of you.

377
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:57.450
You will become the one by following the standard that God has set out in the scriptures. For all of

378
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:06.030
us. You become the one not by listening to people that helps, it can shine a light on things that we

379
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:13.690
need to pay attention to. But we've become the one by following God's word and God's descriptions

380
00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:21.020
are the best ones for us. And when we live those out, we are going to experience the fullness of his

381
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:25.960
blessing in ways that we never imagined. It is not going to just help us in our relationships. It's

382
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:31.540
gonna help us in our businesses with our finances. It's gonna help us with our decision making. It's

383
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:37.090
gonna help us with our parenting. It's gonna help us in our service. It's gonna help us in our

384
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:42.670
understanding of the world around. It's gonna help us when we deal with tragedy, just like when we

385
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:48.640
deal with victory, it's gonna help us with all those things that we need everyday wisdom for,

386
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:55.440
doesn't just deal with relationships, but it spills out and over all the areas of our life where we

387
00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:02.260
need it. And every situation that we are facing. God is gonna give us insight in how to handle it

388
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:07.380
because of the character that we have developed. I know many of us are struggling in the

389
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:12.570
relationships that were in, were struggling with the person we are and the person we're not, we can

390
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:18.430
be struggling in the context of what we're facing may be struggling with an addiction or struggling

391
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:23.660
with the Brokenness that has had a hold on us. I want you to know that instead of praying for the

392
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:31.940
brokenness to be gone and for the person to be removed, or for yourself to just find just joy and,

393
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:43.290
and possibly better in some other field, I want you to start focusing on the character that God

394
00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:50.170
wants to give you instead. And when God works in you, he will make you more, loving, more

395
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:56.660
understanding. He will give you the fullness of His Holy Spirit in a measure and in a manner that

396
00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:05.640
helps you to have what you could never have on your own for the moment in which you need it most. It

397
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:12.240
is so beautiful to see what those characteristics are and how God believes that that's possible in

398
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:19.760
all of us. There isn't anything that he describes in his scriptures that he doesn't for one second

399
00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:27.600
believe that we can achieve. It's there because He believes that we can. And now it's up to us if we

400
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:36.070
will. And so together, let's stop searching for the one and let's become the one instead. Thank you

401
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:37.390
so much. God bless you guys.

402
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:41.020
Mm

403
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:52.080
Next week, I'm gonna talk to you about stop taking the one for a test drive.

404
00:58:54.540 --> 00:59:00.330
That's actually the title of next week's message should be fun.

405
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:14.490
God, I want to thank you that We can just become the one The way that you are the one that in your

406
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:19.640
image, we can understand who we were always meant to be and that we don't have to look at the

407
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:26.360
fragmented broken pieces of ourselves and think that this is somehow the best it's going to get and

408
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:33.240
you can help us work on the very things that we need to focus on to see just change and

409
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:39.660
transformation in our lives and in our relationships. I wanna pray for everyone here that is just

410
00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:48.800
saddened by not being able to find the one for them. I want to pray for those who are reconsidering,

411
00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:54.340
whether they are with the one. I want to pray for everyone who finds themselves somewhere in between,

412
00:59:54.340 --> 01:00:00.900
in their circumstances, in their situation, no longer believing and trusting you God for what it is

413
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:08.800
that they need in their life. I pray that today would be a day in which we better understand what it

414
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.110
looks like to become the One. That we can take the steps to stop asking the wrong questions, but

415
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:20.570
start asking the right ones. Instead, I pray that you would make us all Godly men and women in this

416
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:30.380
place and that we would experience the fullness of what can be lived out when you put your hand of

417
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:41.530
grace and mercy and favor on each of us. And we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you

418
01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:47.320
guys. Thank you so much. Let's continue worshiping. Would you guys stand and we're gonna wrap this

419
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:54.290
gathering up? And uh I just want to just point out that I can't stick around at the end of this

420
01:00:54.290 --> 01:01:03.310
gathering. Uh I have to make my way to uh the H L All Star game. I'm doing a chapel this afternoon

421
01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:11.330
for the players uh there. So I got to leave right away to make it to the, to the arena. And so part

422
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:15.700
of my work as a, as a pro sports chaplain, working with all the teams in Montreal. Sometimes that

423
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:22.640
happens. Um I work with, with these teams and with these leagues and it gives me an opportunity to

424
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:31.000
bring the gospel to them. So could you pray for me as I do that as we bring the gospel into locker

425
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.630
rooms and teach God's word to athletes and see transformation happen in their lives. It's a, it's an

426
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:44.350
incredible honor and privilege to be able to do that and it's not given to everybody. And so I thank

427
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:49.790
God that he's given it to me and give me that opportunity to do that, that I have that um

428
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:56.910
possibility from the higher ups that give me that access. And so thank you for praying for me. God

429
01:01:56.910 --> 01:02:01.300
bless you. I hope you guys are blessed by today's gathering and that you're gonna be blessed with

430
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:06.440
this series and the things that we're gonna grow and, and learn from. I know that God is going to

431
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:12.470
keep doing some pretty amazing things in each of our lives. Have a great Sunday. Stay warm. We'll

432
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:14.590
see you guys next Sunday. Okay. God bless you.

433
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:29.260
We're gonna sing, open the eyes of my heart. And after this amazing message, we pray that the Lord will open

434
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.290
our eyes so that we can become who we want to become.

446
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:55.160
You guys sound great! So that wraps up our service for today. I hope you were blessed by, by the

447
01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:02.170
sermon today. I certainly was convicted. I have some reading to do. Um Just a reminder. We, we so

448
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:08.240
appreciate your generosity here for the community and for the ministries that we support. Church

449
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.980
doesn't end on a Sunday. You can reach out through the week through the website. Someone will get

450
01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:19.070
back to you and we hope to see at the back at the after party, speak to somebody that you don't know,

451
01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:22.710
have a hot drink and something sweet to eat. Have a great Sunday.
