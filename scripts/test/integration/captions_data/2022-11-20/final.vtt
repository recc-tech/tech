00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.100
To him even silence is praise

2
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:12.540
for in him was created the universe of things, both in the heavenly realm and on the earth, all that

3
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:22.900
is seen and unseen. He is the divine portrait, the true likeness of the invisible god. He rides

4
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:33.500
across the heavens to help you, across the skies in majestic splendor. For he is the one all of

5
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:45.820
humanity comes before with amazing wonders and with awe inspiring displays of power. Everyone

6
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:54.720
everywhere looks to him for he is the confidence of all the earth.

7
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.980

92
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.420
Yeah,

93
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.570
okay, everybody so good to be with you. And I just want to kick things off by uh just giving our

94
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:54.140
condolences to the Fairfax family for the passing away of uh of heather, Fairfax to tackle and to

95
00:27:54.140 --> 00:28:00.050
Taran and the Fairfax family, we have our our prayers and our condolences for that God would

96
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:06.000
continue to comfort your lives your families and that you would experience the blessing of God. Like

97
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.090
never before. I know that sometimes when the blessing of God comes on us, it sends an incredible

98
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:23.490
ripple effect throughout the entire family. And when that happens we experience hardships in ways

99
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:33.700
that we previously didn't have them. Sometimes the blessing of God on one of us and two of us can

100
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:43.630
bring about incredible change. And so yes, hardships, but also incredible blessings. So pray that

101
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.810
over your lives guys Amen, we pray for that

102
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:57.550
and I wanted to just encourage you today on this first Sunday that we actually have an opportunity

103
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:06.220
uh to gather on a snowy Montreal day. Some of us thought that this day would never come. Were you

104
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:13.110
ever wrong? And all we can say is thank God, we don't live in Buffalo,

105
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:23.560
but we are excited about the second week in being in this series called the armor bearer and we're

106
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.800
talking about the armor of God and the message today is the armor bearer and we're talking about

107
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.660
this story that is found in in first Samuel, the thing about the armor of God is that we can

108
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:39.840
sometimes just underestimate how beautiful and how powerful this image is in the scriptures and how

109
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.730
important it is for us to live every day with this invisible armor that God has already given us

110
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:52.190
what God does is that he names it for us and he uses the Apostle paul to do that and he uses the

111
00:29:52.190 --> 00:30:01.810
Apostle paul to describe it through the armor that was found on a centurion soldier and through that

112
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:08.000
imagery, we then have this idea and this understanding of all the elements that you see here on the

113
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:16.230
screen of what an armor would look like in that day. And each piece represents something that God

114
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:24.890
has already done for us. It isn't something that you have to wait for. It's something that he has

115
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:33.420
already done. He's already given you this armor, this armor is already on you as a follower of Jesus

116
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:40.640
through the Holy Spirit, God has given it to you. And so when you live life, you know that you have

117
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:47.250
this armor with you always and what it does is that it gives you this picture, this image of you

118
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:55.030
going into your everyday life but prepared for it and prepared for the battles that come and

119
00:30:55.030 --> 00:31:05.570
prepared for what is there that we sometimes feel very much unprepared for. So God doesn't want you

120
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:12.910
to go in with that missing confidence, but he wants you to go with a full understanding of

121
00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:20.110
everything that he has already procured on your behalf. We're gonna read some verses that are going

122
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.650
to provide some context for us this morning. And it's gonna tell us a little bit about the story

123
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:34.650
that we're in. It's a story of King Saul and his son Jonathan and the story in which we're in there

124
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:40.160
in battle with their forever enemies, the Philistines and we don't know who the Philistines would be

125
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:46.740
today because it's a civilization that there's some debate about when exactly was extinguished, but

126
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:54.280
we know that they were such an enemy of God's people and an enemy to the very purpose into the heart

127
00:31:54.290 --> 00:32:01.850
of God, that that is the people that actually disappear. And so there is no more mention of them in

128
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:12.990
history because they eventually just are gone from it. God most likely provided a form of, of

129
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:21.410
judgment on these people that eliminated them from the face of the earth. Now we're talking about a

130
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:27.070
story in which they're still fighting these enemies, these enemies are still there. And many of us

131
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:33.060
like we sometimes hear these things and we wonder, wow, God's harsh, you know, like removing an

132
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:40.500
entire people from the earth and the entire tribe of people are gone and and and it bothers us, but

133
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:48.060
it's like we've never had any hatred in our hearts, like we've never wanted our enemies dead. It's

134
00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:54.550
like we've never wanted victory and wanted others to experience defeat. It's like we never thought

135
00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:00.400
these things and went into battle thinking I'm just gonna go in there and I'm gonna talk my way

136
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:07.430
through this and and hopefully once I've talked my way through it, I'm gonna be victorious. Yeah.

137
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:14.330
Talking sometimes works and I think we should always do that. I think showing love and Jesus taught

138
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:21.450
us that in terms of turning the other cheek and not retaliating, he taught us that as well. But

139
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:28.330
there are times when God also calls us to fight and and that is difficult for us to grasp because

140
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:35.380
most of the time we don't have to literally fight someone else. And even if we're pacifists, and we

141
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:42.760
don't want to go to war or hold a gun or take someone else's life. Sometimes we're put in a position

142
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:50.400
where we may have to do that. And there are great stories of people who made it through battles

143
00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:56.420
where they didn't do that, where they found another way to contribute, where they found another way

144
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:03.890
to help and to make a difference without compromising their convictions. And obviously, if that is

145
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:09.840
your conviction, and understandably, that is something that you must not go against. Why. Because if

146
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:17.490
you go against your own conviction, that's when it becomes actually sinful, see, someone else can

147
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:23.860
tell you that it's right and wrong. But if if you believe it's wrong, and you do it, that's when it

148
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:31.200
actually becomes wrong, because you're going against that with your own conscience is telling you.

149
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:36.450
Now, obviously, there's a moment in which our conscience is then superseded by something greater,

150
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:42.550
and that is God's word. And so we then become aware of what God's word, teaches what his his his

151
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:49.170
heart reveals and what he prefers as our standard. And then when we look at that standard, we say,

152
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:59.070
okay, so maybe my conscience wasn't fully awakened, it wasn't fully aware, it wasn't ready to take

153
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:08.570
on this this way. But it's amazing that God loved me anyways, that he showed me grace and mercy,

154
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:18.930
that he kept revealing how he was gonna bless me and he did bless me, even when my conscience was

155
00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:29.960
misleading me. You see, we sometimes think that our conscience is all that we need to guide us. That

156
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:36.510
that feeling in our heart that we say I'm gonna follow my heart or I've got a gut feeling and I'm

157
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:47.580
gonna follow my gut. Two things that most people have seen in their own experience following your

158
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:56.960
heart and listening to your gut doesn't always work. But when you live by a higher standard, one

159
00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:07.460
that God has put before us all of a sudden it has a way speaking to our heart and to our gut and

160
00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:16.360
then we end up following a better plan in the long run. And this is the difference between Saul and

161
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:25.320
Jonathan in this story, Saul is listening to himself making decisions and every time he makes one,

162
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:32.530
it seems to anger God and remove the blessing that God wants to give Saul case in point, they're

163
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:39.450
going up against the Philistines and Samuel hasn't arrived yet and and he has to wait for Samuel to

164
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:48.730
offer up a sacrifice. All notices that saw Samuel is late. And so he decides that he's gonna go out

165
00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:55.650
and he's gonna offer up the sacrifices himself. And so in this story that we're in song goes and

166
00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:03.410
commends his people to go and gather the sacrifices. He goes out and he offers up 1000 of them

167
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:15.090
because he knows that he's not Samuel. So he's hoping that the number of sacrifices are going to

168
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:22.670
help him in this war against the Philistines, The reason he does this is because Saul is worried

169
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:29.310
because he's seeing defections happen right before his very eyes. People are actually leaving his

170
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:38.510
army and joining the Philistine army, they're actually running away and hiding in capes and they're

171
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.740
doing whatever they can to not have to fight. And so in the story in which we're in, Saul is

172
00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:53.610
panicked, can reveal that panic, but he shows it and reveals it by doing something that he is not

173
00:37:53.620 --> 00:38:02.680
commissioned to do and that is act like the prophet Jonathan, on the other hand, is not even with

174
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:09.660
his father, he's found in another place in the story and the only person that he's with is his armor

175
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:17.240
bearer. And you can see that there's not only a separation in the camp, but there's a separation in

176
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:28.730
the family, Jonathan is respecting his father, but he can't do things his father's way. And so while

177
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:34.140
these sacrifices are being offered, it's clear that Jonathan most likely is not even there, he's

178
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:39.390
with his armor bearer and that's where we pick up the story where Jonathan and his armor bearer are

179
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:47.670
making decisions about what they are to do next and everything in the story reveals that Jonathan is

180
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:53.010
not telling his father Saul what he's planning.

181
00:38:55.090 --> 00:39:06.590
And so we have Saul who's acting according to his own conscience and then we have Jonathan who's

182
00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.600
trying to understand God's heart.

183
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:18.250
And the difference between these two things is the difference between winning and losing. And if we

184
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:24.440
understand this, then we can experience more victories in our life than losses. The story I want to

185
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:31.940
pick up is found in 1st Samuel and then I want to read to you a few verses that give us the backdrop.

186
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:38.490
The first one is found in verse five in first Samuel 13 and it says that the Philistines mustered a

187
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:49.460
mighty armor of 3000 chariots, 6000 chariot tears and as many warriors as the grains of sand on the

188
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:57.580
seashore, that's that's what they had. In verse 19 it says this, that there were no blacksmiths in

189
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:05.340
the land of Israel in those days, the Philistines wouldn't allow them for fear that they would make

190
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:13.470
swords and spears for the hebrews. So they're controlling not only the steel and the metal, but

191
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:18.540
they're making sure that there are no metal workers, no metal smiths, no blacksmiths. And the reason

192
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.850
they were called blacksmiths is because in those days they fashioned the swords and the spears from

193
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:29.290
iron. And so it was considered a black metal and that's why they were called blacksmiths. In first

194
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:37.100
Samuel chapter 13 verse 20 it says that whenever the Israelites needed to sharpen their plowshares

195
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:45.010
picks acts or sickles, they had to take them to a Philistine blacksmith. And so when they went into

196
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:53.810
war, you can imagine that what they had was farm equipment. So the Philistines had all the weapons

197
00:40:53.820 --> 00:41:02.510
of war, but the Israelites didn't have any because they were under the Dominion and the authority of

198
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:09.110
these Philistines. In first Samuel chapter 13 verse 22 it also says this, that on the day of the

199
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:17.560
battle, none of the people of Israel listen to this had a sword or a spear except for Saul and

200
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:28.180
Jonathan, imagine an army and no one other than the king and his son has a sword and a spear. That's

201
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:36.230
all they had, which tells us that the armor bearer didn't have one either and this is important. And

202
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:43.670
so we pick up the story in verse six of chapter 14 now and I think that's going to be on the screen.

203
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:50.360
It's, it's first Samuel 14 verse six and it says, look, let's go across to the outpost of those

204
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:57.820
pagans. And it says that Jonathan said to his armor bearer. Perhaps the Lord is going to help us for

205
00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:10.140
nothing can hinder the Lord. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few do what

206
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:18.170
you think is best. The armor bearer replied, I'm with you completely heart and soul, whatever you

207
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:26.510
decide alright then Jonathan told him we will cross over and let them see us and if they say to us,

208
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:33.660
stay where you are or we'll kill you, then we will stop and no and not go up to them. But if they

209
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:41.340
say come on up and fight, then we will go up and that will be the Lord's sign that he will help us

210
00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:47.850
defeat them. Now, the story in which we're in now you can see that the conversation is between

211
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:56.290
Jonathan and his armor bearer and what we have is one guy with a sword willing to go up against the

212
00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:05.890
Philistine army and none of us would think that would be a good plan. Obviously for obvious reasons

213
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:18.740
and Jonathan is not concerned about how many there are on the opposite side of this battle. He's not

214
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:24.380
concerned about the number of chariots, number of soldiers, the number of swords and spears. What

215
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:32.700
he's concerned about is whether or not God is with him and I love that about Jonathan because in

216
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:42.350
this story, the only thing that matters to him is God with him and if God is with him then he knows

217
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:50.640
that the enemy doesn't stand a chance. And I wonder how many of us in this room have that kind of a

218
00:43:50.640 --> 00:44:00.850
mindset. I mean I know that some of us are more positive than others. I know that some of us lean

219
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:10.360
towards positivity way more than negativity. I know that some of us are better at self talk and and

220
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:21.490
belief and just just trusting that things are gonna work out. Some of us worry so much and others

221
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:30.300
among us don't worry at all. Sometimes the way that we deal with things is just to ignore them and

222
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:37.430
we think that's a solution, it's not always a good sign, but some of us do have the kind of faith

223
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:44.940
that steps into a situation and says I believe that if God is with me then the enemy does not stand

224
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:53.820
a chance. The only thing I need to know is is God with me and and obviously this is what the story

225
00:44:53.830 --> 00:45:02.280
is about because Jonathan speaks to his armor bearer and he says to him these very important words,

226
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:14.940
he says, hey the Lord, he can win a battle whether he has many warriors or a few and so Jonathan has

227
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:22.960
this principle in his heart and he's casting this vision to his armor bearer and his armor bearer,

228
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:31.510
here's this believes it and then responds with these words, he then says, do what you think is best

229
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:39.880
I am with you completely heart and soul whatever you decide and there is a moment where Jonathan,

230
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:46.600
the guy with the sword, is the guy with the vision and the armor bearer is the one with the

231
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:54.430
encouragement to go with him and there's gonna be a moment in our lives where God is gonna call us

232
00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:01.210
to be Jonathan with the sword. But there's gonna be a moment where God is also gonna ask us to be

233
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:09.050
the armor bearer instead and in that moment we're gonna have to understand which role god is calling

234
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.790
us to

235
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:19.160
because if there's only two swords among the entire army and Jonathan has one of them, then the

236
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:25.670
armor bearer obviously has to go with the guy who's got the sword, the guy who's got the vision, the

237
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:33.760
guy who has the understanding of what God is able to do in a moment like this. But armor bearer means

238
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:40.090
I'm with you, I will cover you, I will encourage you, I will protect you, I will make sure that when

239
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:47.400
you go out against the enemy, the enemy will not be able to defeat you because I am coming with you

240
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:55.510
and I know that there are many times in our lives where God has called us to be the armor bearer and

241
00:46:55.510 --> 00:47:03.620
we have rescinded that call. We have not lived up to our mandate, We have not fulfilled what God has

242
00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:11.730
required and requested of us. We didn't believe in the guy with the sword, We didn't believe in the

243
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:18.640
woman who was caught in that moment to leave, We didn't believe in the situation and the purpose of

244
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:28.840
what was brought before us and instead of covering with the armor, we made a decision not to go into

245
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:40.230
battle and not only was the life of the one who had the sword lost, but then your life as the armor

246
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:48.370
bearer was lost as well and what God is trying to do is make sure that that situation never repeats

247
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:55.190
itself. So we're talking about the sword bearer and the armor bearer and the reality is that

248
00:47:55.190 --> 00:48:02.510
sometimes you are the one who's going to be leading with the sword and other times you are going to

249
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:09.880
be the armor bearer, it's essential to have someone with vision as much as encouraging the person

250
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:18.520
with vision and in this lifetime you are called to be a Jonathan, just like you are called to be an

251
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:28.990
armor bearer. And that calling is always on us. It's gonna be one or the other. And I believe that we

252
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:34.950
live our lives as the sword bearer and the armor bearer at all times, there are times when God's

253
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:42.490
gonna call us to lead and other times he's gonna call us to follow. I was at a prayer retreat in

254
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:52.210
Orford with a bunch of young adults and adults that were doing work in Quebec, whether it was sports

255
00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:59.380
university teams or professional teams like myself or whether they were working on campuses from

256
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:06.650
john Abbott to Concordia to McGill to french colleges like champlain and and on and on it went and

257
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:14.530
and the room was filled with people who were doing everything in their power to make sure that every

258
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:24.150
where they were placed, they would be the armor bearer and that they would also be the sword bearer,

259
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:30.520
the sword bearer because they had been appointed but the armor bearer because their whole role is

260
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:37.470
about developing others to take their place and make sure that more people can be where they are

261
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:43.550
doing the work that they're doing and in that setting, which was a prayer retreat where we had three

262
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:49.740
days of coming before God and just putting aside all of our earthly distractions and just focusing

263
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:56.330
on what it would mean to see. Quebec reached for the gospel as I found myself in this retreat, the

264
00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:04.420
only thing I had to be in this setting was an armor bearer. I didn't have to lead. All I had to do

265
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:11.030
was submit to the leadership that was there, submit to what they were doing to submit to every

266
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:18.060
session, submit to what they were asking me to do, to reflect upon to pray about too fast, about to

267
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:27.580
bring into accountability, that's all I had to do was be an armor bearer, follow the leadership of

268
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:38.700
someone else and in that setting I had no right To be the sword bearer even though in other areas of

269
00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:47.050
my life, I am one but where I was, I was called to be an armor bearer and you see every day of my

270
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:57.150
life, I am making a decision: am I a sword bearer or or am I armor bearer? Who am I in this setting,

271
00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:06.050
what am I being called to do in this moment, it might being called to lead or am I being called to

272
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:13.670
cover? Can we say amen to that? Come on. Now, if you understand this and you're gonna understand how

273
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:20.620
in every moment God is gonna call you to be one of those two things and there's gonna be moments

274
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:29.210
listen, when someone else has the sword in this case it was solved and he was up offering sacrifices.

275
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:37.790
He was up doing the wrong thing. When Samuel shows up, he says Saul because of what you did, you and

276
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:47.710
your lineage will never be king again. Okay, another king has already been appointed to take your

277
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:57.120
place. Mhm. He lost on that day, not just

278
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:05.690
the people's favor. He lost Gods.

279
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.710
He was afraid of losing his army and he lost his kingdom instead.

280
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:21.740
And in that moment he was holding onto the wrong thing for the wrong reasons by the wrong methods

281
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:32.880
and God just took it away and gave it to another but not far away. There was someone else who also

282
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:43.090
had a sword and God said if I can get solved to do it the right way, I can get Jonathan to do it

283
00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:50.930
instead. And I need you to understand there's gonna be a moment where someone is leading and the

284
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:57.960
anointing has already been taken from them and it's no longer for them to hold the sword. It's your

285
00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:03.390
turn to be the sword bearer. Can we say amen to that? But you need to understand that moment. God

286
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:08.080
has to show it to you is gonna have to be clear. You take it for yourself, You're just gonna end up

287
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:14.390
into another loss, You're gonna have greater losses more than you've ever imagined could be possible.

288
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.380
And so you need to understand that there's always going to be a moment where God's calling you to be

289
00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:25.550
the sword bearer and a moment where he's calling you to be the armor bearer. Okay, can I move on to

290
00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:32.060
the next point? Everyone's saying, please please go, but I feel like if we don't get this part,

291
00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:40.130
we're not gonna get it okay? And so God says Jonathan, you're gonna be the sword bearer. And so what

292
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:46.800
Jonathan does is that he says here are the right tactics and the right timing for what it is that

293
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.780
we're going to do. And so imagine the right tactics and the right timing. So what does he say to the

294
00:53:51.780 --> 00:54:00.500
armor bearer? He says, if they tell us come on up to us, then that will be our answer that we go.

295
00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:07.510
But if they tell us to stay where we are, then we don't advance and we know that God isn't with us.

296
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:14.950
So I want you to see that up until this moment. Even Jonathan isn't entirely sure how this is gonna

297
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:21.450
play out. And so I hate it when Christians go around acting like they've got it figured out there.

298
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:28.280
So certain those are sure God has spoken to me, I had a dream, I had a vision, I had a verse, I had

299
00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:34.720
this and I had that. Come on, there's guys who in the scriptures are always kind of saying, I'm not

300
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:41.180
too sure about this more often than not. You have the greatest leaders in the Bible who lack

301
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:48.920
confidence even after God has shown up and spoken to them in the most unusual and unpractical ways.

302
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:55.890
Even in those moments, those guys are kind of like, I don't know if this is gonna work and then we

303
00:54:55.890 --> 00:55:02.760
have believers, Christians going around the world yielding their swords, causing nothing but

304
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:11.190
destruction wherever they go. Because they haven't understood the difference between God going with

305
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.440
them and they wanting this more than God

306
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:25.850
and I can assure you that in a moment like this, we are seeing Jonathan who's filled with faith who

307
00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:32.710
said out loud to his armor bearer that gave him the confidence to go into battle with him that God can

308
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:43.810
win any battle whether with many warriors or just a few that he still says it's good if God makes it

309
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:54.030
clear, it's good if God shows us the sign that we need, it's good that he tells us whether or not we

310
00:55:54.030 --> 00:56:01.310
should go up or not. And you know, I always wondered like why would that be the right time and the

311
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:08.340
right tactic in terms of Jonathan saying if if the Philistines tell us to come on up, that that

312
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:14.530
would be the sign, I think I would have done it the reverse. But but the reason Jonathan doesn't

313
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:23.570
like this is because he understands that God is a God of advance and his people are too, God is a

314
00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:30.000
God who advances. He is never a god who retreats.

315
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:40.310
And I know that when we think of what it looks like to be with God, we need to understand this truth

316
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:47.900
that God is a God of advance. And so if we are not advancing in our lives, listen to me. There is

317
00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.240
something that is wrong in our life,

318
00:56:53.320 --> 00:57:00.190
there is something that God is still working in our life. There's something that he's bringing about

319
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:07.210
transformation regarding in our life. Now we're going to have blessings and breakthroughs but we are

320
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:12.970
not going to experience the level of multiplication that God wants to give us until we understand

321
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:19.550
certain principles. And the principle here that we need to get is that God is a god of advance. And

322
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:27.800
the second one in the story is that God defeats the enemy when we are determined to act, if we are

323
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:35.320
not determined to act then we are not going to see the enemy defeated, Jonathan is able to

324
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:42.760
experience victory because he was always determined to act on God's behalf. He was saying God used

325
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:48.800
me Is this the moment God these Philistines, they may be more than us but it doesn't matter because

326
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:54.850
they don't have you. God, I'm willing to go out into this battle armor bearer are you with me? You

327
00:57:54.850 --> 00:58:04.690
see when you are ready and willing to act, God says I'm going with that dude, I'm going with that

328
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:12.040
girl, I'm going with them because they understand that I'm a God who wants to advance, I'm gonna go

329
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.640
with them, I'm gonna give them my blessing, I'm gonna give them my multiplication because they are

330
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:23.710
not living for themselves, they are living for me, they're doing things so that light can overcome

331
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:31.110
the darkness and I will always give people like that more power, I will always give them more

332
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:37.490
influence, I will always give them more to manage, I will always give them more and more and more

333
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:44.990
because I can trust them with it. See that's what God is looking for for people that he can entrust

334
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:54.230
all of this with that's why in first Samuel 1412 it says that the men from the outpost shouted

335
00:58:54.240 --> 00:59:02.900
shouted to Jonathan coming up here and then they said these words, we're going to teach you a lesson.

336
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:11.160
And in that moment the thing that Jonathan says to his armor bearer is that he says come on, climb

337
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:20.480
right behind me, Jonathan says for the Lord will help us defeat him because he got the sign that he

338
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:27.060
had asked for and I think that sometimes we've been taught something really weird, we've been taught

339
00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:34.950
that we can't ask God for signs, we've we've somehow told ourselves that if God gives us signs, that

340
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:41.870
that's somehow a weakness of faith, but I need you to understand that everybody in the Bible got a

341
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:42.800
sign

342
00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:51.930
and they did incredible things because even in their moment of doubt and weakness and maybe where

343
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:57.360
they were debating whether or not they should go ahead and do this. God came to their help and to

344
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:04.810
their aid and helped them by giving them an additional sign. I mean there's this guy by the name of

345
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:12.180
Gideon who every day gave God a brand new test one day I want the ground to be wet and I want the

346
01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:19.650
fleece to be dry the next day is I want the fleece to be wet and I want the ground dry. And every

347
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:24.630
day he'd wake up and he'd say God, I'm gonna give you another test just to be sure. Are you sure

348
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:31.600
that you want me to go out into battle? And then when he went out into battle and he finally agreed

349
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.530
and there were these soldiers all gathered at the water and some guys were dunking their heads and

350
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:42.310
other guys were cupping their hands and looking around and and God says everybody who cut their

351
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:47.620
hands and drank from the water and looked around, that's your army, send everybody else home. And

352
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:53.780
then Gideon's like what? That doesn't make any sense. I'm now gonna be stuck with only 300 out of

353
01:00:53.780 --> 01:01:01.010
thousands and God's like: whether there be many warriors or a few, I can win every battle.

354
01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:10.210
You see when you're the sword bearer, the only thing you need is the armor bearer, can we say amen

355
01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:17.890
to that? You need the right armor bearer with you and then you can go into any and every battle and

356
01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:24.260
defeat any and every enemy. See that's what God wants us to understand, it doesn't matter how many

357
01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:31.860
we are, but who we are, when we go into battle, who we have with us, when we go into battle, what we

358
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:40.440
understand our principles, When we go out into battle, what we are building our victory upon when we

359
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:47.100
go into battle. See God wants us to understand those things and then no matter what the battle is,

360
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:52.180
no matter what it is that we're living and facing in life, no matter what challenge we may be

361
01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:57.150
dealing with right now, no matter what it is that's happening in our mind or in our body or in our

362
01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:03.080
relationships in our finances, in our business, in our careers, in our education, no matter what's

363
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:10.930
happening, matter even what's not happening, God is saying, don't you get it, I have given you a

364
01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:21.880
sword to wield and the Holy Spirit is going to be your armor bearer. That even if no one goes with you

365
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:30.100
understand this, I am the invisible armor bearer that you need to go into battle. Can we say amen to

366
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:41.710
that? Come on, come on, come on, God's got it all figured out, he's got it all worked out, there is

367
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:48.310
no one and nothing that we have to depend on other than God, it doesn't matter if no one comes with

368
01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:56.150
us because he's always with us and he's always willing to be the armor bearer in our life, you know

369
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.180
he tells us the sword is

370
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:08.360
the spirit, it is his word and I believe that in the moment in which we're hearing the Philistines

371
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:16.140
mocking them, here's what's happening. I believe that the world and I believe that satan I believe

372
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:21.980
that darkness, I believe that evil is always arrogant and overconfident

373
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:33.850
and I believe that because it is always arrogant and overconfident, it gets its behind handed time

374
01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:45.010
and time again, there is no way that God is going to let arrogance and overconfidence win, God

375
01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:53.130
defeats that enemy every time and so when we are overconfident, when we are arrogant, when we

376
01:03:53.130 --> 01:04:01.790
believe that we can do this in our own strength, we experience defeat. But when we go out with God

377
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:09.500
and understand that whether we be many warriors or a few it doesn't matter because we will always

378
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:17.650
defeat the enemy that is before us and these Philistines, they were arrogant, they were

379
01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:25.500
overconfident, they said come on up, we're gonna take care of these guys, just two of them And the

380
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:33.550
scriptures tell us that there was 20 of them at this outpost, just one outpost, 20 of them and the

381
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:38.500
Bible says that as they were climbing up to where this outpost was,

382
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:48.980
that Jonathan was killing those in front of him and the armor bearer was killing those behind him.

383
01:04:52.270 --> 01:05:01.330
And then all of a sudden there were 20 that were dead and the garrison had been taken over. And as

384
01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.050
the other garrison which is a little bit higher up, saw what happened to the lower garrison, they

385
01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:14.580
began to panic. The Bible says they were so filled with panic that God did something else to

386
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:25.590
accentuate it. See God magnifies the effect of vision and the armor bearers faithfulness by sending

387
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.430
an earthquake.

388
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:37.120
And though they were already panicked, God made their panic even worse. And all of a sudden now in

389
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.990
this Philistine army, Saul and his army see what's happening, they joined the attack. Now they have

390
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:51.230
the confidence to go in the Bible says in chapter 14 verse 20 that that's when they joined the

391
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:57.740
attack. Only after Jonathan and the armor bearer had killed 20 soldiers and panic had gone through

392
01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:03.580
the Philistine army and that the earth had shook with an earthquake. And in that moment the Bible

393
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:11.620
says in first Samuel 14 21 that the Israelites that had defected and were already working with the

394
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:20.420
Philistines, they revolted and started to fight against the Philistines where they were and then the

395
01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:27.640
ones who had run and hid in the caves, Will they joined the attack too. And then all of a sudden

396
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:38.180
everyone who didn't have the courage to go into battle now had it and they had it because this is

397
01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:47.140
what happens. God always magnifies the effect of vision and faithfulness. Can we say amen to that

398
01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:57.290
when we go out in his name, this is what he does. He creates the circumstances for the victory. And

399
01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:02.680
even those who had abandoned, even those that were hiding, even those that had left, even those that

400
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:12.000
had defected. They all came back to fight against the Philistines and they defeated them. They put

401
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.600
that enemy down because light spreads

402
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:29.890
because it defeats the darkness wherever it is found and it goes into the hearts of those who had

403
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:37.830
even turned their back on their own people and their own God, do you see what happened there? They

404
01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:46.140
didn't just join the Israelites. They had left God to do it because you left your God to follow the

405
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:52.740
gods of another people. You understand what happened in the story and then because of what Jonathan

406
01:07:52.750 --> 01:08:01.490
and the armor bearer did, the people who had left God to serve and to follow other gods, they all

407
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:13.130
came back. And so the victory wasn't just Jonathan and David, it was for the people that belong to

408
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:21.990
God and what we see in the stories that God didn't want anybody to be left out of that victory. The

409
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:32.060
vision that God had for Jonathan and the faithfulness of the armor barrel produced victory for

410
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:40.880
everyone. It wasn't just for Jonathan. I mean he could have went back and said Saul, dad, I love you

411
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:49.560
but you suck as a king. I'm taking over. This victory happened because of me. But he doesn't do that

412
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:59.670
when the people who had revolted and defected and hid in the caves, they were all pardoned, even

413
01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:07.510
though you would expect that all of them deserved another punishment. But the victory on that day

414
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:14.090
wasn't just Jonathan's, it was everybody's and the Bible says something about Jesus, he says that

415
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:21.570
there's a guy who comes to work in the field at the first hour And then there's someone who comes to

416
01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:23.240
work at the 11th hour

417
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.520
and then Jesus says, this is how my father rewards. It doesn't matter if you came at the first hour

418
01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:39.870
or the 11th hour, but everyone gets the same pay

419
01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:50.520
and what he's saying with that is something that all of us should be incredibly thankful for that.

420
01:09:50.520 --> 01:10:00.930
It doesn't matter at what time we arrive or join the fight or change allegiances or make our

421
01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:11.310
decisions to lead the darkness And be one with the light. But it's the fact that we did and the

422
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:20.020
blessing that God has for us is the same, whether I started serving him When I was seven years old,

423
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:29.410
18 years old or at 99 years old. It doesn't matter the blessing that God has for us is exactly the

424
01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:42.510
same. The armor bearer gets the armor, the invisible armor of God, the moment that he decides who

425
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:51.360
the sword bearer is going to be and today today I follow Jesus into battle. He is the sword barrel

426
01:10:52.720 --> 01:11:00.690
and he has given me the privilege of being an armor bearer and I will follow Jesus wherever he leads,

427
01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:09.330
whether we be many warriors or a few, we together will always defeat the darkness. God bless you

428
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.450
guys, thank you so much.

429
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:22.300
Hey, I wanted you guys to stand um, and it'd be really cool if you did that and thank you for your

430
01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:28.830
patience today and your time uh, in being here and being with me and being a part of this is so

431
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:34.140
great uh, to have so many of you here and, and for all those that are watching online, we look

432
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:40.260
forward to receiving your back and having you here with us as well. And I'm really excited about the

433
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:47.120
next several weeks that we have in front of us. So many great things were announced today about

434
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:53.010
what's coming up and what's happening and I know we're all excited for that, but right now I think

435
01:11:53.020 --> 01:12:00.380
we all need to follow Jesus, the sword bearer uh into battle, we're ready father, thank you that you

436
01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:08.120
have called us into battle with you that you have given us the invisible armor that we can be the

437
01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:15.260
armor bearer and then the moment that you call us to lead, we will do it, we pray that you make those

438
01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:24.690
moments clear to us that you give us the signs that we need it so that we can go with certainty. Our

439
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:29.890
confidence is in you. The Philistines put their confidence in themselves, they put it in their

440
01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:37.380
swords and their spears in their chariots and in their army. But we put our confidence in you holy

441
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:46.060
spirit, thank you for the way that you cover us go with us, go before us are always with us and for

442
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:52.420
the way that you give us victory in the areas of our life where we need it most Lord, you see where

443
01:12:52.430 --> 01:13:00.820
each and every one of us needs victory. Today you see what we are battling what we are fighting but

444
01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:07.480
we are attempting to overcome and Lord maybe we're trying to do that too much in our own strength.

445
01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:16.630
But today we understand that we can only have the victory if you give it to us, if you are with us,

446
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:25.190
if you are the presence that we need to accomplish it with and we pray this in Jesus name, Amen Amen,

447
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.080
God bless you guys! Thank you so much. Hey, we're gonna sing a song that we haven't sung yet. Okay,

448
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:37.790
so it's a new song, It's called Freedom. Let's take an opportunity right here to declare that before

449
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:42.500
we go and I hope to see you guys at the after party is a great time for us to say hi and to connect.

450
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:47.120
I'll be there in just a few moments. And you can go and grab your coffees, hot chocolate,

451
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.270
there's tea, there's all kinds of sweets and treats. One of the things we love to do at River's Edge is just

452
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:58.820
gather around community and and we do that best around food. I see Jesus, one of the biggest

453
01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.520
criticisms was like, he was always eating and drinking. I said, man, that's the kind of church I

454
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:08.870
want to be, I want to follow in Jesus footsteps. Let them criticize us for always eating and

455
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:13.700
drinking. That's awesome. As long as we do it in his name and do it together and encouraging one

456
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.320
another. Let's sing this song called Freedom

457
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.460
All right, let's get ready to rock it. This is gonna be a fun song.

471
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:15.240
Well, can we give a clap to our worship team and Lorenzo for a lovely gathering today.
