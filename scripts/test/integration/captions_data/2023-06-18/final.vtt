00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:56.760
We brought parenting questions to some of the wisest minds on the planet. You guessed it, dads. This

2
00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:57.980
is ask a dad,

3
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.160
what should I do if my kids won't come? When I call them, turn off the wifi and watch them all

4
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:14.010
magically appear. Will my Children ever let me use the bathroom in peace? Yes. When they move out of

5
00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:20.239
your house, when we're playing sports, should I let my kids win? Absolutely not. It's not your fault.

6
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.700
God bless you with incredible athletic talent. Why is there peanut butter on the back of my couch?

7
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:33.459
Why are there legos in the fridge? No one knows what if my kids don't think I'm cool. It doesn't

8
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:41.480
matter because deep down all dads know that they are so cool. How come nobody laughs at my amazing

9
00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:50.660
dad jokes because you're doing it right? Why can't my kids remember to do their chores? Because that

10
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.390
part of a child's brain is reserved for remembering all the things you hoped they'd forget. Why

11
00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.079
won't my Children listen to me?

12
00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:10.769
What, how do I get my kid to eat dinner? You look him right in the eyes and you tell them you are

13
00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:15.010
going to your friend's house for dinner. Problem solved

14
00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:28.829
as a dad, how can I dress for success? Two words cargo shorts.

15
00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:42.100
I don't know how to follow that. That was so funny. I love a good dad joke. So anyways, welcome to

16
00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:47.380
church. We love you. If you're here in person or online, we're just so happy. You're here at River's

17
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.910
edge and we care about you. So we care about you as a person. We care about your story. We care

18
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.380
about your history with God. We want to get to know you. Um And I really believe God is gonna speak

19
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:02.000
to you today. We have such an amazing gathering plan today because I love every single person on

20
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:09.299
this stage so much and I know their heart is so beautiful. We have an all women team today. Uh Yeah,

21
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.239
for father, we're giving the fathers a break because it's Father's Day and we love all of you. We

22
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:19.369
love all the dads in the house. Uh We honor you and uh we wanted to just give, you know, the dads

23
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.570
and the, the men on the team a break as well. So each of these women are just so special and I've

24
00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:29.100
heard them practice and it's gonna be amazing. The Lord is gonna be here, moving his presence is

25
00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:34.679
gonna be here and speak to your heart. Um And then when they're done, um Pastor Zoe is going to come

26
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:40.299
out and he's going to give us a timely word on redefining fatherhood. So again, Holy Spirit is just

27
00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:45.820
gonna hit all of our hearts. I know that as he does every week. So let's stand to our feet. Let's

28
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:51.840
just posture our hearts in just a place of surrender and hope and love and just receiving from his

29
00:08:51.849 --> 00:08:53.349
presence today as we worship

30
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:04.830
everyone. It's so good to see each and every one of your faces. Happy father's Day to all the dads

31
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:12.700
and dad figures in the crowd here and online. Um Yes, and all the guys too. All the men, we just

32
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:19.020
want to honor you today like Christina said, and I wanted to begin today by reading a verse and uh

33
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:28.440
you could read with us. Um uh What, what soon as the slide is on. There we go. OK. So it's from um

34
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:36.799
James chapter one. Uh verse 17. Every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the

35
00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:45.440
father of the heavenly lights who does not change like shifting shadows. And I wanted to show you um

36
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.059
all the aspects and characteristics of God that we're gonna be singing about today in the worship

37
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:57.369
set. So he is good. He is our source of love, hope and peace. He affirms us. He's always there for

38
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.270
us. He provides, he pursues us. He's our heal. He's interested in every single detail of our lives.

39
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:12.030
He's perfect. He's powerful, merciful. He's a miracle maker, a chain breaker. He restores. He is

40
00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:18.960
worthy of all our praise. He is faithful. He's our father, he's our friend, he's our king. And the

41
00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:23.799
reason why I wanted you guys to know this is because on Father's Day of all days, we're, we're

42
00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:30.119
thinking about like our relationship with our God, our father. And sometimes there's that disconnect,

43
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:38.400
right? And uh that kind of doubt because of our uh experience with earthly fathers that it, there

44
00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:45.590
might be like that doubt like, well, is he really all that and more? And he is, he's there. And I

45
00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:51.729
just wanna pray for you guys before we enter into worship, father. I just thank you for every person

46
00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:59.380
in this room tonight today and we just thank you that you are a good father. You're all the things

47
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.090
that are on that slide and more and I just pray that every heart here would know that you love them,

48
00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:10.609
that you continue to pursue them. You're interested in every detail of your lives. Thank you so much

49
00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:14.489
for being our good, good father in Jesus name. Amen.

87
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.739
Heavenly Father. We thank you that you're here in this house today. Lord, we thank you Lord that you

88
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:39.900
are worthy of all praise. There's nothing on this earth for that will ever fill the words in our

89
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:46.670
hearts. That the way you can. Lord, we thank you Jesus that you love us with an everlasting love. We

90
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:53.040
thank you that you are a good God. We thank you Lord that your promises of your goodness and mercy

91
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.329
that would follow us all the days of our lives. We thank you God that whatever you want for us is

92
00:19:57.339 --> 00:20:04.010
good and evident times, Lord, when we don't know or we don't see or don't understand why things are

93
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:10.069
the way they are. We know Lord that we can trust you because you are faithful and you are kind and

94
00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:17.130
you are good lord. We love you Lord and we worship you and we praise you Jesus and we thank you for

95
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:17.939
being our father.

124
00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:21.869
Yeah. So, yeah, an all female worship team this morning for Father's Day and uh we've got a

125
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:28.530
phenomenal uh day planned for you and we have a very important announcement to make right now, which

126
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:35.569
is with regards to uh a new ministry that we are uh launching at River's Edge, which is called uh

127
00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:43.449
guys. And so I want to invite uh to the stage, uh Alex and Paul, if they would come and join me up

128
00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.689
here, would you welcome them?

129
00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:53.719
That's it. Thanks guys.

130
00:25:57.869 --> 00:25:59.160
It's a bit of a labyrinth.

131
00:26:01.199 --> 00:26:06.979
That's awesome. So, this is Alex and this is Paul and uh there are new men's ministry leaders here

132
00:26:06.989 --> 00:26:11.969
at River's Edge. The ministry is called guys and we thought it'd be an appropriate thing to launch

133
00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:19.729
it on Father's Day. And we've got um an event that is actually coming up in July. And if you weren't

134
00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:27.270
aware of this yesterday, um the girls launched their first event and uh Patricia Godley, who's our

135
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:34.030
women's ministry leader for girls. Uh She put on an incredible event yesterday for all the women and

136
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.729
for the women that were there. Can you give it up to uh Patricia and her team and just for all the

137
00:26:39.739 --> 00:26:48.689
hard work and an incredible spread and, and just a great time of worship and spiritual moments for

138
00:26:48.699 --> 00:26:55.579
them. And we are just so proud of our women's ministry team. And so we also are launching a men's

139
00:26:55.589 --> 00:27:00.930
ministry team and these are the two guys that are going to be doing it and we are just so blessed

140
00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:07.670
that we are able to take these steps. And the first event that we have is going to be coming up in

141
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:15.819
July. And so Paul, you want to tell us a little bit about the event? My pleasure. So on, uh, as uh

142
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:22.699
Pastor Lorenzo said on July 15th, it was gonna be combined with guys and girls, uh which was kicked

143
00:27:22.709 --> 00:27:26.219
off yesterday. And so we're gonna be meeting in the park. It's gonna be a barbecue. It's on a

144
00:27:26.229 --> 00:27:34.900
Saturday. It's from 11 AM to three PM, uh barbecue burgers, volleyball and just a good chance for us

145
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:42.229
just to come together, hang out, have some fun. And at that event on Saturday, July 15th, we will

146
00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:48.069
also be sharing more about the next guys events, which will be also in a month's time about mid

147
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:55.439
August, which has something to do with tents and the woods, you know, roughing it out, having some

148
00:27:55.449 --> 00:28:01.569
fun, getting some battle wounds, but looking forward to it. Thanks. And because we were excluded

149
00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:03.420
from the women's event yesterday,

150
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.920
we thought we would create an event where the girls could join the guys. I'm not saying we're better

151
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.349
already, but it just,

152
00:28:16.219 --> 00:28:20.119
but you can see that's why the two logos are there. It's because it's open to everybody. So all the

153
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.569
guys and girls can come to this event and um and it's going to be a great time for all of us to get

154
00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:30.020
to know one another. And then we do have that uh camping slide to show you guys as well. And so

155
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:35.425
there's going to be a guys camping trip. And um and so we're gonna encourage you guys to sign up for

156
00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:40.474
both of these events. So anybody who wants to come to the girls and guys barbecue and volleyball, as

157
00:28:40.484 --> 00:28:45.505
well as the guys camping trip, you can have an opportunity next Sunday to start signing up and let

158
00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:51.204
people know about it so we can uh do that. And right now we just want to take a moment uh to pray

159
00:28:51.214 --> 00:29:01.180
for these two guys. Would you guys stand with me as we would just uh appoint and anoint uh them for

160
00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:05.099
this ministry at River's Edge. Can we give it up for uh Alex and Paul?

161
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:16.270
And I'm just gonna pray right here. Father. I want to thank you for Paul and Alex and for their

162
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:22.380
lives for the gifting that you have put upon their lives. The calling that is on their lives to lead

163
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:28.770
this ministry. Uh They have this deeply rooted in their hearts to do, they really want to impact not

164
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.640
only this community of faith, but this city. And what we pray, Lord is that you would use them

165
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:39.829
powerfully for that. And we ask your protection on their lives as they would step up and step out to

166
00:29:39.839 --> 00:29:45.869
lead other men in deep and meaningful relationships, not only with each other, but with you. And we

167
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.469
ask that you would protect them and that you would continue to bless and provide for them. And we

168
00:29:50.479 --> 00:29:55.229
thank you for all that you've already done in their lives and we do through their lives to be a

169
00:29:55.239 --> 00:30:00.910
blessing to the guys at River's Edge and then in the city of Montreal and we pray this in Jesus name.

170
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:07.520
Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Thank you so much, man. You wanna talk about uh the gift? Oh Yeah,

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.819

172
00:30:14.829 --> 00:30:19.439
morning and uh we weren't too sure if they're gonna come in time, but God made a way if he made a

173
00:30:19.449 --> 00:30:27.310
way for Moses and the Israelites, he can make a way for coasters. So, uh gentlemen in the back. Um

176
00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:43.380

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:53.770
the woods in the house will be good examples. Awesome. Thanks guys. Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:24.270
intimate, super special. Um And we want you to be there. So yeah, come hang out, come to that and

194
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.770
they're also working really hard for that. So if you want to invest and you want to help, but maybe

195
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.150
you don't, you know, you don't sing or play an instrument and they've already got that team. They

196
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.729
actually need help setting up and, and taking it down. So if you wanna do that, come and lend a hand,

197
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:45.689
uh and we'll be super blessed for that. So also the tech team, I love the tech team. They're all

198
00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:51.040
amazing and they're some of my favorite people here and we actually need more of them. Um You don't

199
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.650
need any, you don't need experience if you've never done it before or you're scared because it looks

200
00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:00.869
daunting. They are just the best. They will walk you through every step of the way and we need more

201
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.829
people. They are like the foundation of the church. Honestly, they're what helps make this run. So

202
00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:13.260
if you want to, maybe you feel stirred to serve in that area, reach out. We actually really want to

203
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:19.055
hear from you, Josiah is one Sam's in the back there. Ben, you can talk to any of these people. Um,

204
00:33:19.064 --> 00:33:23.584
and they'll be, you know, they, they'll be honored to kind of just walk you through how that works.

205
00:33:23.594 --> 00:33:29.175
Um, but we would love that if you'd want to help out in any way, um, in the back. And, uh, lastly

206
00:33:29.185 --> 00:33:34.545
there's four ways to give. So, you know, nothing is too small. We just, we love your heart, whatever

207
00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:39.694
you feel, you know, led to give uh in this season, we've got four ways to do it and they're up on

208
00:33:39.704 --> 00:33:45.035
the screen. Ok. So let's go ahead and just prepare our hearts for the message. Um and welcome pastor.

209
00:33:56.569 --> 00:34:01.130
I don't care how I'll let you stay out, stay out as late as you want. You wanna borrow the new car,

210
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:07.020
you wanna borrow my credit card kids today. They really have it rough. I have no idea where we are

211
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:12.760
or where we're going. I mean, when I was their age, life was easy. Super easy. Why haven't you

212
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:18.514
gotten a tattoo yet? How come you don't have any piercings yet? Yep, we're lost, we are completely

213
00:34:18.524 --> 00:34:27.284
lost. E sports just do whatever the mechanic says to do. Vehicle maintenance is completely overrated.

214
00:34:27.294 --> 00:34:33.114
Look, whatever the mechanic is asking, just pay him, pay him whatever he wants. I wish they had soap

215
00:34:33.125 --> 00:34:38.955
operas at night. I like that boy. You should date him. You should date him immediately. But what

216
00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:44.510
about the creepy guy with the motorcycle? He's cute. Yeah. Sure. Spring break in Tahiti? Sounds fun.

217
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.830
Hey, make sure you get all your video games done before you start your homework. You don't have to

218
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.120
pass all your classes. What? You have a project due tomorrow and you've known about it for four

219
00:34:55.129 --> 00:35:01.669
weeks and you haven't started yet. Sweet. Doesn't anybody wanna know if we're there yet? Remember if

220
00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:07.320
you need anything between midnight and four AM? Please come wake me up. Hey, I'm on the phone. Could

221
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:13.050
you bring the baby over and let him climb all over me? Hey, hey, can you please turn that music up?

222
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.429
Well, we just stopped for lunch 10 minutes ago. But yeah, let's stop again. I never have trouble

223
00:35:20.439 --> 00:35:25.209
with my toddler. I never have trouble with my teenagers. I never have trouble with my adult Children.

224
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:32.879
You know, she's right. We are ruining her life. Yes. More homework to correct. All right. Whining

225
00:35:32.889 --> 00:35:41.040
yay tantrums. Hm. Vomit. We just really need to spoil these kids more. Sorry, buddy. I don't know

226
00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:47.320
any good jokes at all. You're 16. You pretty much know everything now. I think 18 is a great age to

227
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:52.239
get married. Ok. Remember make sure you turn on all the lights before you leave the house. Hey,

228
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.659
could you leave the front door open for a couple hours? Thanks.

229
00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:06.840
Oh, money really does grow on trees.

230
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:20.969
All right. So if you haven't figured it out yet. We like that fun at River's edge. So, so we're

231
00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:25.209
gonna be starting a new series after this Sunday called Getting There. And it's about the essentials

232
00:36:25.219 --> 00:36:31.350
that we need to be successful, to be blessed, to be prosperous, to have a life that is full of

233
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:39.300
meaning in this time that you are actually living in some of the things that we can sometimes

234
00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:44.669
imagine is that whatever we are going through is a transition to something better. But it's the life

235
00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:48.800
that we're actually leading right now that needs to be full of meaning and, and we need to be able

236
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.429
to see the opportunities that are right in front of us. And so we're gonna be talking about that in

237
00:36:52.439 --> 00:36:58.229
the series called Getting There. And so today, we are going to talk about redefining fatherhood and

238
00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:04.330
the passage that we're actually going to look at is one that's completely unusual for a father's day

239
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:10.219
message. And it's certainly unusual for something that is going to speak to us about fathers. It's a

240
00:37:10.229 --> 00:37:17.459
passage that actually refers to the time in which Jesus was baptized. And it's a moment in which he

241
00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:27.649
finds himself in a moment of his own choosing to be right where the father has willed him to be. And

242
00:37:27.659 --> 00:37:34.699
I think when we understand that the father's will and our choices can align it is when we can

243
00:37:34.709 --> 00:37:41.050
experience blessings in our life like never before. And Jesus modeled that in every way. And that's

244
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:48.909
why he was obedient in all things because he pleased the father. And we're encouraged to do the same

245
00:37:48.919 --> 00:37:57.899
to live as Jesus lived. And the Bible describes that as being a perfect way of life. And if we can

246
00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:05.159
manage that, if we can embrace that, and if we can apply that, then we're going to experience what

247
00:38:05.169 --> 00:38:12.280
this passage means in a whole new way. And so before we jump into that, I thought it would be

248
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:18.889
important for us to just go through something that is also probably more problematic than theology.

249
00:38:18.899 --> 00:38:27.010
And that is dad jokes. And, and the reason dad jokes are hard is because they're intentionally

250
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.489
mainly not funny.

251
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:36.870
That's what makes them a dad joke. They're, they're, they're not supposed to make you laugh as much

252
00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:41.860
as they're supposed to make you groan. That's how, you know, you've, you've delivered a perfect dad

253
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:50.510
joke. If you get too much of a laugh, you did it wrong. But if you get it just right, you'll know.

254
00:38:50.969 --> 00:38:55.120
And so I'm going to put up some dad jokes and see if you can identify with some of these. Ok. Here's

255
00:38:55.129 --> 00:39:01.429
one. Did you know that milk is the fastest liquid on earth? It's pasteurized before you can even see

256
00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:09.399
it. Mhm. Yeah, exactly. That's perfect. That is a perfect Dad joke. Now you're getting it, now

257
00:39:09.409 --> 00:39:13.159
you're getting it and then we're gonna get into the perfection of Jesus. You understand where I'm

258
00:39:13.169 --> 00:39:18.919
going with this, the perfect dad jokes and then the perfection of Jesus. Now, number two, the

259
00:39:18.929 --> 00:39:28.350
wedding was so beautiful that even the cake was in tears. No, you're laughing too much. Now, now

260
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:38.290
it's too much. Ok, here's the third one. What do you call an illegally parked frog? Toad.

261
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:45.800
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. If you boo it's even better.

262
00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:55.820
If you boo at a dad joke, then it's perfect. Ok? So no more laughing, just boos. Ok. Next one. Ok.

263
00:39:56.919 --> 00:40:01.820
Men, how do you keep the dream alive? You hit the snooze button.

264
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:16.969
That's very. Yes. Yes. Ok. Here's, here's number five. Number five. You want to hear a joke about

265
00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:19.929
paper? Never mind. It's terrible.

266
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.850
Ok. Ok. Those are my top five. But because you're such a great audience, I've got a bonus joke,

267
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:43.899
bonus joke. Here it is. What did the ocean say to the shore? Nothing. It just waved.

268
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:58.320
Yes. Yes. It's a glorious morning. Happy Father's Day. All right. And now for spiritual things, I

269
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:05.739
gotta transition with a prayer because I'm no good right now. Father. It is about you. It is about

270
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:12.919
what you can teach us about you and how we can become like you. And today we're gonna understand it

271
00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:18.020
so much better through how you redefine things for us in your scriptures. We pray that you bless

272
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:25.379
this word. And the next moments that follow in jesus' name. Amen in Matthew chapter three verse 16.

273
00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:31.320
And 17. It says this. So after his baptism, as Jesus came out of the water, the heavens were opened.

274
00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:36.679
And then he saw the spirit of God that was descending like a dove and they actually settled on him.

275
00:41:36.689 --> 00:41:47.879
And then a voice from heaven said, this is my dearly loved son who brings me great joy in the

276
00:41:47.889 --> 00:41:53.830
passages that we just read. There are three key things that are in this passage. Three key things

277
00:41:53.840 --> 00:42:00.560
that help us redefine what fatherhood is and help us correct the mistakes that we may have because

278
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:07.770
of our absent fathers or because of our lack of proper fatherhood in our own upbringing. It can be

279
00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:15.919
because of how we lived our everyday life that we may misunderstand even how the father is to each

280
00:42:15.929 --> 00:42:21.580
of us redefining what it means to be in relationship with him. I don't know if you've ever done this,

281
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:27.090
but when you find something that's missing in your life, you tend to look for it and you tend to

282
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:33.149
look for it wherever it is that it becomes available. And sometimes it's something that is really

283
00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:39.139
flawed and broken and imperfect that we tend to gravitate towards. And we always hope that it gets

284
00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:44.379
better that it is better that it somehow fulfills us and satisfies us and then it always leaves us

285
00:42:44.389 --> 00:42:50.560
empty and wanting and desiring more. And yet we can't get it out of our heads that, that this is

286
00:42:50.570 --> 00:43:02.239
just what it's always going to be. And because of that, we settle and we just decide that this is

287
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:10.469
how we're gonna have to live with the sorrow that this is what it's going to be. And I can't expect

288
00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:18.129
more even if I want more. And, and, and there are times when we have literally just walked away from

289
00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:24.310
relationships because of the fact that they were just so unfulfilling and unsatisfying because they

290
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.929
would just fill us with so much grief because our expectations were here and the way they were met

291
00:43:29.939 --> 00:43:38.290
were always somewhere down low here. And as a result, we found ourselves just wanting more, needing

292
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:44.939
more, hoping for more but never really experiencing it. Well, the thing about fatherhood and the

293
00:43:44.949 --> 00:43:52.439
thing about God as our father is that a father is always present. And in the story that we're in the

294
00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:59.110
moment in which Jesus gets baptized, we see that Jesus is present at his most important moment. This

295
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:05.800
baptism is really about Jesus saying I've accepted the plan that you have for me to come to earth.

296
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:12.199
And baptism is a symbol of Jesus going to the cross. And when Jesus gets baptized, he's speaking to

297
00:44:12.209 --> 00:44:17.060
the moment where he's going to go to the cross. So before his ministry even begins before he even

298
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:22.510
does a single thing before he teaches a single word, he's going to tell the world that what he's

299
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:28.290
going to do is that he's going to die. And he's going to do it this way. He's going to die, he's

300
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:35.000
going to be buried. And on the third day, he's going to rise again. And baptism spoke to that plan.

301
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:42.919
It spoke to that promise and it spoke to his purpose. And when Jesus accepted those things, the

302
00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:50.270
father was present, was present in his life. And the Bible says that the heavens opened and the

303
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:58.209
spirit of God actually descended on him in an even more powerful manner. It settled on him. It meant

304
00:44:58.219 --> 00:45:03.649
that it didn't just appear, but it settled on him. I don't know what's settled in your life. I don't

305
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:13.040
know what remnants are on you from fatherhood that you experienced. But chances are, there's a lot

306
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.860
of not good in that.

307
00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:22.439
There's a lot of stuff that, that settled on you that didn't make you better in this life that

308
00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:30.969
didn't make you feel whole in this life. Chances are that there was a lot of Brokenness in, in that

309
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:36.909
and, and, and, and as a result that Brokenness kind of settled on you and without realizing it,

310
00:45:36.919 --> 00:45:42.790
you're, you're every day as a man, you're sometimes living out that Brokenness, you're living out

311
00:45:42.979 --> 00:45:49.719
that anger, you're living out that frustration, you're living out that life that settled on you. I

312
00:45:49.729 --> 00:45:56.989
want you to know that God can redefine that right now and he can break those patterns

313
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:08.229
so that we can understand that when the father shows up in our lives like he is showing up right now.

314
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:19.600
He can settle on you. He can descend on you and he can change everything that happened before by

315
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:28.639
your Heavenly Father's powerful hand, instead of your earthly Father's hand. Instead, are you ready

316
00:46:28.649 --> 00:46:31.959
to experience that change that difference in your life?

317
00:46:34.159 --> 00:46:42.520
I, I don't know about you, but I want the spirit of God, I want my Heavenly Father's presence to

318
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:50.840
descend on me. I remember one time my dad, um I begged and begged and begged for, for weeks uh to

319
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:54.889
take me to a Montreal Expos baseball game. Anybody member of the,

320
00:46:57.909 --> 00:47:04.580
it was one of the best days of my life in my childhood to be able to go see a baseball game. My dad

321
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:10.959
was there. He, he brought me to the stand and, and he was Italian. So he was trying to haggle the

322
00:47:10.969 --> 00:47:18.030
price of a hot dog down and there were some embarrassing moments, but that was just what my dad did.

323
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:23.219
And, and uh, and then we went back to our seats and we ate our hot dogs and we were watching the

324
00:47:23.229 --> 00:47:29.909
game and, and I was playing with my friends that were there and, and, and I was the only kid in my

325
00:47:29.919 --> 00:47:38.510
class that actually showed up with his dad and, and I realized that um my dad like sacrificed in a

326
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:45.040
way that day that I had never seen him do before. And at a certain point, my dad just fell asleep

327
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:50.060
somewhere around the fifth inning. And if you've ever been to a baseball game, you know, that's

328
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.889
what's supposed to happen at a baseball game. So

329
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:59.500
it's a very slow game and there's a lot, a lot, a lot happens sometimes. And so my dad fell asleep

330
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.080
and my friend turned to me and he said, and he said,

331
00:48:04.209 --> 00:48:11.580
your father's asleep, you're such a loser. And I said, you're the loser. At least my father is here

332
00:48:17.149 --> 00:48:23.889
and that just like shut him up. I didn't hear another word. And, and what happened is in that moment

333
00:48:23.899 --> 00:48:29.969
my dad showed up. And you know, I'm telling you, it's not often my dad showed up, he showed

334
00:48:29.979 --> 00:48:34.459
up in ways that didn't matter to me. But that day mattered to me as a kid. It mattered. And my dad

335
00:48:34.469 --> 00:48:41.790
showed up and his presence there kind of just like spoke to me about how important I was in his life.

336
00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:51.459
And it was a testament to everyone else that was also present how important I was in his life. And,

337
00:48:51.469 --> 00:48:59.020
and what that does is that when the father shows up, he tells everyone around you in ways that you

338
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:08.649
don't need to because his presence has descended upon you that you are important to him. And when

339
00:49:08.659 --> 00:49:14.659
you walk around with this knowledge, with this understanding, with this kind of faith, then you know,

340
00:49:14.669 --> 00:49:22.500
your life is completely different because your father is present your Heavenly Father is present,

341
00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:32.419
your heavenly Father has descended upon you. Your heavenly Father has settled on you and when your

342
00:49:32.429 --> 00:49:39.370
Heavenly Father settles on you, you go everywhere with that presence, that presence doesn't just

343
00:49:39.379 --> 00:49:47.030
come down on you once it's always with you, wherever you go, whatever you're going through, whatever

344
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.790
you're battling with, whatever you're struggling with, whatever you're trying to believe for

345
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:59.620
yourself, whatever your circumstances are even speaking against, you can just trust in the presence

346
00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:07.570
of the father. The second thing that happens in this story is that there's a father's love that is

347
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:15.090
displayed here that is unlike any other in the scriptures. What the father does in this story is

348
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:24.360
that he tells Jesus and everyone that is hearing and has ears to hear in this moment that this is my

349
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:37.939
dearly loved son that no matter what happens next, never doubt and question that this is my dearly

350
00:50:37.949 --> 00:50:47.959
loved son. A father loves a father loves like no other. I I know that a lot of dads of, of my

351
00:50:47.969 --> 00:50:56.959
generation just love their families by working by providing. Um I don't know if you ever hugged

352
00:50:56.969 --> 00:51:01.070
someone who had never been hugged before. They, they don't know how to do it because they were never

353
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:09.699
trained. And uh and, and I remember hugging my dad was always like a, a tough thing and it was just

354
00:51:09.709 --> 00:51:15.330
felt weird. So I didn't do it a lot every once in a while it would happen. And it was like an

355
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:20.840
awkward moment that we just like brushed off very quickly. And, uh, there was one time in particular

356
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:27.629
when I got a little older, I was like 16 and I got a little angrier, uh towards my dad and towards

357
00:51:27.639 --> 00:51:33.850
my father and the fatherhood that he displayed in our household. And, uh, and I wasn't even saying

358
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:43.850
hi to him when I came into the house and my dad demanded very much, uh from us. But there was one

359
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:52.090
thing that he especially like was adamant about and that was, um, you know, showing him respect. And

360
00:51:52.100 --> 00:52:00.750
so walking into the house and not, and not saying hi or, you know, saying hello or just saying we're

361
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:07.860
home, um, you know, was not, was not ok. But then my father would, would go further than that. He

362
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:13.219
say, uh when you walk into the house, you're gonna come to me, you're gonna say hello and then

363
00:52:13.229 --> 00:52:23.739
you're gonna kiss me on the cheek. Oh, my dad was like, I tried to negotiate with him and say, how

364
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:31.820
about if you know, I just say hi, you know, why is the kiss necessary? And, and, and my dad said,

365
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:39.090
and my dad said because even if you don't feel it, I need you to know

366
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.020
that I always will love you.

367
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.070
And that what really broke me.

368
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:55.060
He was trying to teach me

369
00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.939
to love him back

370
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:08.090
the way he loved me but couldn't show it and didn't know how to show it. And so the moment that we

371
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:12.550
were in and what we were dealing with, there was a moment in which he was trying to teach me

372
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:23.110
something about what it looked like to trust in a love that we sometimes have absent in our life

373
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:35.860
that we don't experience at a level that we need, that isn't shown to us in a manner that speaks to

374
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:36.530
our life.

375
00:53:38.639 --> 00:53:48.129
My dad was trying to tell me that you are loved and you are the most important thing to me. I just

376
00:53:48.139 --> 00:53:50.370
don't know how to show it any other way.

377
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:59.520
And so I'm going to put you in a position where you're going to have to step into the house that I

378
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:08.010
have provided for you and you're going to greet me, you're gonna kiss me. And even if you don't feel

379
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.909
it yet, the day will come when you will.

380
00:54:11.989 --> 00:54:20.770
And I think that when we understand how the father's love works, it can transcend every moment that

381
00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:27.129
we haven't experienced in this life, the difficulties and the challenges that you have and maybe

382
00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:33.050
identifying with that love from an absent father or a broken father or a father who just didn't go

383
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:40.189
far enough in terms of expressing that maybe you had an amazing father, but very few of us can, can

384
00:54:40.199 --> 00:54:46.120
even in, in saying that we had an amazing father, can't find fault with the way that he lived out

385
00:54:46.129 --> 00:54:53.659
his fatherhood. And the truth of the matter is, is that when, when God reveals his fatherhood, he

386
00:54:53.669 --> 00:55:01.760
shows it to us in a perfect manner. And what he does is that he shows us that the father always

387
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:11.870
loves. I wanted to meet up to my dad's expectations and his standards every day of my life. When I

388
00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:17.020
would come home and show him what I had done, I could always have done better. Did anybody else have

389
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:24.590
a father like that? It didn't matter what I did. It just was never good enough. I, I, I could have,

390
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:31.090
I could have done anything on the field off in the classroom. I could have just, you know, saved a

391
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:36.810
life. It wouldn't have been enough. You would have said, why wasn't there a second person you saved?

392
00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.860
There was always something more I could have done. And, and if you've lived with that kind of

393
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:51.830
standard and, and always felt that as a result, your, your love was always conditional. It's hard to

394
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:59.669
understand how a father loves truly. When we look at the heavenly Father, imagine never having to do

395
00:55:59.679 --> 00:56:11.760
a thing, never having to do anything, right? Never having to be the best. And yet God says, I love

396
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:12.040
you

397
00:56:15.189 --> 00:56:23.649
bringing nothing, contributing, nothing offering nothing being the best at nothing. And the father

398
00:56:23.659 --> 00:56:26.620
still says you're dearly left.

399
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:37.600
I couldn't have asked for a better son or a better daughter. If you can understand this. It totally

400
00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:43.719
shatters whatever image and understanding you have of fatherhood, it redefines it completely. And

401
00:56:43.729 --> 00:56:51.129
God is saying this is the love that a father has. And the last thing that happens in the story is

402
00:56:51.139 --> 00:57:00.409
that a father affirms and what he does is that he brings great joy. He the father here when he looks

403
00:57:00.419 --> 00:57:08.820
at Jesus, he doesn't just say that he's dearly loved, but he says he brings me joy. I, I, I love the

404
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:18.330
fact that my kids still both live with me. I, I, I, I, I dread the day when they won't be there. So

405
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:26.050
I will do everything in my power to keep them there for as long as I can because they bring me such

406
00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:31.560
joy. They really do. I love knowing they're home. I love knowing they're in their beds. I love

407
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:39.219
having supper with them. I love being able to sit as a family and still have, you know, good and,

408
00:57:39.229 --> 00:57:48.010
and weird conversations. I love being able to still get into stupid arguments with them. Sometimes I,

409
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:55.290
I love it all. It brings me a lot of joy. I, I love the fact that I get to still have my family

410
00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:02.459
together and I realize what a privilege that is and how many people don't have that and how many

411
00:58:02.469 --> 00:58:08.310
people would want to have that and they aren't experiencing it because certain things have happened.

412
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:17.500
I left home when I was 19. Years of age and, and I was, I was gone for the, almost the better part

413
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:25.090
of a decade before I, I, I had to move back in, married him with a son because I was a pastor and I

414
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.520
couldn't afford my own place.

415
00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:35.320
And I remember that, that all those years of being away, the thing that I yearned most was to be

416
00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:42.600
able to come back to my father's house, a house that I couldn't wait to leave. Does it, does it make

417
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:51.739
sense? A house that I couldn't wait to get away from? Because I thought that I could do it better. A

418
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:58.949
place where I would find affirmation in other people's homes and in other cities and in other places

419
00:58:58.959 --> 00:59:05.649
and in other lands. And I traveled so much and I preached the gospel in so many countries. And I,

420
00:59:05.709 --> 00:59:11.469
and I lived abroad and I pastored in churches in other cities around the world. And I did all those

421
00:59:11.479 --> 00:59:17.040
things as long as I didn't have to be in my father's house.

422
00:59:19.629 --> 00:59:24.280
And, and, and what God did is that he brought me back to my father's house

423
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:33.669
to make sure that that relationship would heal, to make sure that the things that weren't said and

424
00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:40.530
weren't seen and weren't understood and appreciated when I had the opportunity

425
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:51.030
that he could redeem those moments before my father would eventually die. Not long after that, after

426
00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:55.330
two years of moving back home and being with my father, my father passed away

427
00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.100
and I saw how God had orchestrated all those things and just gave me that opportunity for closure.

428
01:00:03.429 --> 01:00:07.209
And there are sometimes in our lives guys where we don't get closure. There's a lot of places in my

429
01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:13.469
life where I didn't get it. So even if, if this was a moment where I did, I want you to know there

430
01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:19.560
were a lot of, a lot of moments where I didn't, but God gave me a closure that I was, I wasn't even

431
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:25.479
looking for. I didn't even know I needed. He gave me a closure in a manner that I never would have

432
01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:30.639
accepted on my own terms. Does that make sense? It's like I had to be forced into that closure. I

433
01:00:30.649 --> 01:00:38.209
had to be forced into that moment. I had to be forced into experiencing what I was going through at

434
01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:47.070
that time. And what does God do in all those moments is that he still affirms us? Do you feel

435
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.909
affirmed by the Father today? Do you feel like He brings you great joy that no matter what the

436
01:00:53.919 --> 01:00:59.959
circumstances of your life are that he could still bring joy into your life? See, that's what the

437
01:00:59.969 --> 01:01:07.550
Heavenly Father does. He doesn't just derive joy from you. He can bring joy to you. And so can you

438
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.189
make those steps in your life? Can you take them? Can you understand what they are right now so that

439
01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:18.989
He can lead you down that path because this is what it says in Ephesians chapter four verse six, it

440
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:27.750
says fathers uh don't provoke your Children to anger by the way that you treat them, rather bring

441
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:37.280
them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord. And so in this passage, we're

442
01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:45.409
told that God is not a God who provokes God is not a God who comes into your life and tries to stir

443
01:01:45.419 --> 01:01:54.479
things up. He's not there to make things worse. He's there to bring joy. If he has to tell fathers

444
01:01:54.489 --> 01:01:58.439
not to provoke their Children, it's because God doesn't provoke us.

445
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:05.600
And if you understand this about God, then you'll understand that when circumstances happen, the way

446
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:11.360
that they do and things are happening, the way that they are. This is not coming by the hand of God.

447
01:02:12.139 --> 01:02:19.320
God is not the one provoking you. God is not the one who is mistreating you. God is not the one

448
01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:26.050
who's doing any of these things. And yet often that's who we blame. That's who we walk away from.

449
01:02:26.189 --> 01:02:33.340
That's who we say isn't being a good father to us. We say God isn't what he needs to be in my life.

450
01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:40.350
And so we get distance from Him. But why would we do that when we have a father who is always

451
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:47.840
present a father who always loves a father who always affirms a father who confirms that he is never

452
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:53.840
going to provoke you to anger. He is never going to be the one who mistreats you, but he's going to

453
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:59.800
give you the right measure of discipline and instruction to raise you up in the right way so that

454
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:05.969
you can be your best self in this life. We're supposed to say God, thank you for your discipline.

455
01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:11.419
Thank you for your instruction. Thank you for your correction. Thank you for all those things. Why?

456
01:03:11.429 --> 01:03:23.409
Because you love us because you affirm us because we can trust you in this moment. I know it's, it's

457
01:03:23.419 --> 01:03:30.570
a challenge for us to be able to put this into practice the moment that we hear it. But it's

458
01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:36.320
important for us to know these truths so that we know what to put into practice. I don't know how to

459
01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:45.429
see God or have him in my life. If I don't do what he is showing me to do right here. Have you guys

460
01:03:45.439 --> 01:03:46.520
ever heard of Mansplain?

461
01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:53.820
Man's blaming is a thing. I didn't, it's been a thing for a while, but it's basically a woman who

462
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.570
feels like a man is explaining something that she's already got.

463
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:06.449
But I also feel like women don't always get us. I feel like sometimes women don't always understand

464
01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:12.510
what a guy is doing in the moment that he's doing it. And so I felt this would be a good segment for

465
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.310
me to approach this topic

466
01:04:19.949 --> 01:04:22.899
and so allow me to mansplain.

467
01:04:26.479 --> 01:04:34.110
Here's the first one if something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you

468
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.610
sad or angry. We meant the other one,

469
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:50.959
ok? If we ask what is wrong and you say nothing, we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are

470
01:04:50.969 --> 01:04:53.830
lying but it is a hassle to find out

471
01:05:02.719 --> 01:05:08.550
only a yes or a no are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

472
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.949
Yeah, we heard every word. We are just too scared to answer.

473
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.479
That's why there is silence.

474
01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:38.290
And number five answers will always be given when the questions are brief to the point and asked

475
01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.719
when we are not watching something.

476
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:44.070
Thanks guys. God bless you.

477
01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:47.429
Yeah.

478
01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:56.570
So we've got an amazing gathering that's continuing right after the service, which is our Father's

479
01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:01.780
Day brunch. Excited for that and excited for what we can offer with community kitchen. Thank you

480
01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:06.870
guys for all your hard work and for putting on this incredible spread for us. Can we give it up for

481
01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:08.260
our community kitchen team?

482
01:06:18.189 --> 01:06:22.729
And men don't forget to pick up your gifts and um Christina is gonna come out now and we're just

483
01:06:22.739 --> 01:06:29.570
going to wrap this up. Would you guys stand and we have a song that the band is gonna play. Sorry,

484
01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:39.800
Christina don't come up. I forgot we got a song. The band is uh still got one more song for us. So

485
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:44.070
Lord, as we come before you and we want to understand fatherhood, we know that we're going to

486
01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:50.540
understand it best even through your interaction with Jesus. And we look at you and we understand

487
01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:57.909
that you are our heavenly father and that you are a good father to each of us. We see that you love

488
01:06:57.919 --> 01:07:10.409
us. We see that you are a God who affirms us. We see that you are a God who is always present in

489
01:07:10.419 --> 01:07:18.429
every moment of our lives. And you know how to deal with us. When our earthly fathers provoked us,

490
01:07:18.439 --> 01:07:28.139
you, you know exactly how not to do that. When they fail to give us wisdom and instruction. Lord, we

491
01:07:28.149 --> 01:07:35.229
can lean on your wisdom for that. When we feel like we're never good enough in your eyes. There's

492
01:07:35.239 --> 01:07:43.870
nothing more that we need to do to be loved completely. And today is a day in which we can be

493
01:07:43.879 --> 01:07:51.719
embraced by your fatherhood and be blessed like never before. And I pray for all the dads in the

494
01:07:51.729 --> 01:07:57.639
house and we pray to your hand, a blessing upon them as they lead their households, as they lead

495
01:07:57.649 --> 01:08:06.020
their families, whether their household is complete or whether it's broken. I pray Lord that you

496
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:15.439
would be able to enable each of them to step out into the broken places and be an instrument of

497
01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:23.089
healing. I pray that you would give them the opportunity to be an even better father than their

498
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.649
fathers were to them. I pray Lord that you would be able to take all the men that are in the house

499
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:35.629
and, and turn them into men of God that have that are of the highest caliber that are gonna redefine,

500
01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:42.398
not just fatherhood but manhood in the city in Jesus name, I pray Lord that you would help every

501
01:08:42.409 --> 01:08:48.750
person take the next steps in their journey so that they can be everything that you have created

502
01:08:48.759 --> 01:08:56.700
them to be. And we pray this in the Father's perfect love for us as seen and understood and

503
01:08:56.709 --> 01:09:10.548
experienced through Jesus Christ, our Lord and friend in his name. We pray. Amen. Amen. God bless

504
01:09:10.559 --> 01:09:17.048

505
01:09:17.059 --> 01:09:28.100

506
01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:33.919
there was a day. There was a moment in my life where hearing a message like this, I'd be like God

507
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:40.819
loves God affirms. He's present like you sure he doesn't change like shifting shadows like you know,

508
01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:47.689
I don't know. And you know, my doubt didn't make it less true then. And it's, and it's true.

509
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:55.160
Definitely true. Now, after having been a Christian for more than 18 years, um he does love us and

510
01:09:55.169 --> 01:09:59.640
he has us on his mind all the time. And so let's sing this last song together.
