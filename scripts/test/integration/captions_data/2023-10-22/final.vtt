WEBVTT

1
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.260
Good morning, everyone. We're so glad you're here. We're just blessed that you're here in the house

2
00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:54.630
today. Can we just everyone give yourselves a round of applause for being here in the house. The

3
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.899
weather is getting gloomier. Um And also if you're online, we just wanna acknowledge you. We love

4
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.130
you, whether you're joining on the podcast or I think it's Spotify podcast, youtube. There's

5
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.859
multiple places we love you and you know, your presence matters whether it's here or whether it's

6
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:16.140
there. So we're all a family. Um So, yeah, we're just happy you're here. And I just wanna remind you

7
00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:22.829
guys about the youth ministry. So it starts every Sunday at 10 and then the kids ministry uh has

8
00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:27.760
some worship that's led by our team and that starts at 10 30. So just a reminder if you have kids,

9
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:33.000
you have youth, that's how that works. Um We have a great day planned today. I believe God is gonna

10
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.230
give something fresh and specific to your heart. Holy Spirit knows what you need. We're gonna give

11
00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:45.549
him space to just move. He's already here. He loves you. Um And God and God is gonna speak mightily

12
00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:50.100
through Pastor Zoe, I think the turning point series has been just life changing for all of us in

13
00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:55.459
certain ways. So I believe that God is gonna speak to you. Um And he's gonna give you what you need.

14
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.910
So I just wanna pray, Lord, thank you that you're here, Jesus. We love you. We put our focus on you,

15
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.220
we put our eyes on you. That is what the service is for. That is what we commune for. We're here for

16
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.454
you. So God, I just pray Holy spirit that you would fall fresh on this place that you would rest on

17
00:08:12.464 --> 00:08:18.765
us and that you would speak to us. God, speak through pastor o speak through the worship God that we

18
00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:24.035
would come together, lift our voices and praise your name because you are worthy to be praised.

19
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:33.719
Thank you, Jesus. Amen. So let's go ahead and stand and posture our hearts just in that place of

20
00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.349
worship and welcome the worship team.

21
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:43.119
Hello. Hello. Hello. We're gonna start with a great worship song. It's about praising our Lord. This

22
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.309
is gonna get you up at your seats and I want you all clapping. Let's go, Josh. We're gonna praise

23
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.210
the Lord who come on, let me hear you,

24
00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:02.320
praise and worship the Lord, our God.

100
00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:17.579
Thank you God. That when we worship you are here, you're already here. And when we worship, we put

101
00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:23.810
our eyes on you God and we thank you for that. We thank you for your presence and thank you to the

102
00:26:23.819 --> 00:26:29.660
worship team. They serve faithfully day in and day out. Speaking of serving, uh we actually have a

103
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.329
table in the back that you guys can sign up to if you haven't gotten involved or if you're curious,

104
00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:39.550
is there a way to get involved? Um It's just nice to be the hands and feet of Jesus and church is

105
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:45.819
the greatest place to do that. You make great friends and uh and you just get to display an aspect

106
00:26:45.829 --> 00:26:52.359
of jesus' nature when we serve, right? We're the greatest when we serve um others. And so we have

107
00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:57.579
ways for you to do that so you can sign up in the back. Um I was just told previously before the

108
00:26:57.589 --> 00:27:04.479
service that we do need two people uh for tech and then we'll have a complete ministry there. So if

109
00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:09.140
you wanna kind of dip your toes in that area, you don't have to have any experience, to be perfectly

110
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:14.390
honest. Um Really like you can, they'll train you. Josiah is amazing. All of them in the back, Sam,

111
00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:20.410
they will all train you. Um Ben, let's just give it up for, give it up for them. It's literally the

112
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:26.229
ground up the entire service. We would not be here doing this without them. So yeah, and they're

113
00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:32.209
amazing teachers. So they will teach you and then kids, we need kids, ministry volunteers. So if you

114
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:37.920
wanna jump there, we definitely need help. So yeah, we and it's not just that we need help. It's

115
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:44.040
also one of the greatest ways to see your gifts start to come out and to grow is to find ways to

116
00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:49.079
serve and you start to see things come alive in you. Um As you're giving out, it's just, it's a

117
00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:54.520
really beautiful way to become more of who you're called to be. So see whoever's gonna be there in

118
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:59.630
the back. I don't know who it will be, but there will be a sign up table. Um Next thing is we are

119
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:07.180
having a worship fundraiser night, uh this Friday. So it's actually the 27th and it's to raise funds

120
00:28:07.189 --> 00:28:12.760
for Anawim. So Patricia, she's right there, Perle and her team, they're gonna go over to Madagascar.

121
00:28:12.979 --> 00:28:21.910
and Sri Lanka and Tanzania. No? Ok, Sri Lanka was on my list. Sorry, not Sri Lanka, but

122
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:29.050
Tanzania and Madagascar and that's it. OK, perfect. So we love what they are doing. We love Anawim, we

123
00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:34.010
love Patricia and we love what God is doing through that ministry. Um So that is the whole

124
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.880
purpose of this night. It's to raise funds, it's to bring awareness and uh it's gonna be really a

125
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.910
beautiful time of worship as well. So if you just love worship in general too, come hang out and

126
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.369
there will also be a suggested donation of $20. Uh but it's really to help get those funds going for

127
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:54.459
what God is gonna do in Africa. We're so excited what God is doing in her ministry. It's beautiful.

128
00:28:54.469 --> 00:29:00.359
It's incredible. Like it's honestly, I get, I get goosebumps thinking about it. So yeah, come to at

129
00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:05.260
least come to the fundraiser at 6 p.m. You know, if you want to learn more about it too and talk to

130
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:12.810
Patricia. So the next thing is the fall fest, which is happening next week after the service. So the

131
00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:18.199
29th and I if you've been here every year, we have this, then it's really exciting. It's just after

132
00:29:18.209 --> 00:29:22.969
the gathering, we'll have bouncers, we'll have games candy, we'll have a photo booth. We'll have

133
00:29:22.979 --> 00:29:29.890
costumes are welcome. You can dress up. Um And we'll have pumpkin pies too. So, yes, I think we

134
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:35.619
should all be here. Don't run out. There will be pumpkin pies. And Yvonne Masella is gonna be our

135
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:41.510
guest speaker. So she used uh people here would know her from when she used to be here. So, yeah,

136
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.339
Doug is nodding his head. So Doug knows. But yeah, it's very exciting. So stay after the service and

137
00:29:47.349 --> 00:29:51.390
it's also nice too. We just get to celebrate together and hang out and it's just more time to

138
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.199
fellowship and find your people and connect. So, um and then lastly, we have four ways to give and

139
00:29:58.209 --> 00:30:02.859
they're gonna go show up on the screen. Yeah. So just giving is a really beautiful way also kind of

140
00:30:02.869 --> 00:30:08.119
similar with serving. It's a way to connect to what God is doing in your life when you give out as

141
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:13.680
well. Um You are being the hands and feet of Jesus, you are being um someone who is reflecting his

142
00:30:13.689 --> 00:30:18.520
nature and uh giving is just another way to do that as well. If this house has blessed you in any

143
00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:24.380
way, I know this house has blessed me like so incredibly much, so much healing and um and so giving

144
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:29.359
back is a way to keep this moving and to just see what God can do with it. Uh So there's four ways

145
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:34.780
to do it. If it's hard, too hard to do in person, you know, we've got e-transfer, Tithely, email. So

146
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:42.359
pick a choice. And uh yeah, that is that so very excited for what Pastor Zo is gonna preach. And uh

147
00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:46.430
let's just posture our hearts and just prepare our hearts for the word because the Holy Spirit is

148
00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:46.989
gonna move.

149
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.859
So this man

150
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:16.489
perfect love cast out of one John 4 18. Uh The turning point in my journey was when this was became

151
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.439
personal and very real to me. I was navigating a lot of uncertainty. A lot of change. Uh moving

152
00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:29.319
countries settling in being far away from loved ones, COVID, um general uncertainty around my future

153
00:31:29.329 --> 00:31:34.949
and of course, lots of doors shutting on me in that particular season. And all this filled me with

154
00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:42.010
so much of fear that I felt too paralyzed to take action. I was forgetting how to thrive and I felt

155
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:47.750
like I had no joy anymore. So I reached a place where I said, Lord, I'm praying about a lot of

156
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:56.530
things and I don't know if you can hear me anymore because I feel very alone in this. But because

157
00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.510
I've seen you come through for me in the past, I am going to choose to surrender and partner with

158
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.040
you and I give you all the fear that I'm feeling in my heart. I prayed that prayer, I might have

159
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:16.099
actually cried it. But all I heard in my heart was trust me. And since then I've seen, since that

160
00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:22.849
prayer, I've seen God begun to do things in my life. Or rather I've been able to see God in

161
00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:27.829
everything that happens in my life and more than anything, it's been a change in my heart and my

162
00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:34.160
posture when I know that I am fully loved, uh fully known and that his perfect love casts away all

163
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:34.520
fear.

164
00:32:41.229 --> 00:32:47.239
Thank you, Snia for uh sharing your testimony with us, your turning point in your life. And we're in

165
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:52.569
this series called Turning point. And every week we've been looking at different moments in which

166
00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:59.219
people in the scriptures have experienced a turning point, a turning point for the positive or a

167
00:32:59.229 --> 00:33:05.180
turning point for the negative. And I know that many of us can learn from those stories. And today,

168
00:33:05.189 --> 00:33:12.550
I believe that we're gonna have that opportunity again. I think that when we talk about kindness, I

169
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:20.880
think all of us would probably put ourselves in the category of being kind. Maybe we've met someone

170
00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:30.619
who has blessed us with immense kindness has revealed a kind nature to us in the moment in which we

171
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:40.310
needed it so desperately. And it has forever impacted us. And when we think of kindness, we can't

172
00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:49.170
help but think not just of that moment but of that person. Sometimes we've received acts of kindness

173
00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:59.329
and we've never even known who it was that we could actually thank who it was that we should just be

174
00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:09.310
grateful for. And yet we struggle with being kind. We know that kindness is one of the ways that God

175
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:16.110
describes the fullness of His presence in our lives, in the scriptures. It's described as the fruit

176
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:24.030
of the spirit. It's the evidence of a tree that gives good things to those around them. It's like

177
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:30.550
when you're a good tree, you have good fruit. And when you go to that tree, you are nourished by it.

178
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.520
And God looks at us and says, I want you to be like that. And one of the things that I want you to

179
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:43.760
possess. And one of the things that I want you to have is kindness and yet we struggle with this,

180
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:52.149
especially when things are not going our way. I think it's easy to be kind, when things are in our

181
00:34:52.159 --> 00:35:00.239
favor. It's difficult to be kind to people who are not kind towards us. It's in those moments that

182
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:11.590
we actually can reveal what measure we have within us. It's like weighing ourselves. And I believe

183
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:20.889
that when we are purchasing things by the weight, it's important that the scale be accurate. I don't

184
00:35:20.899 --> 00:35:26.840
think anybody enjoys being ripped off. And when you're going to buy something and purchase something,

185
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:33.429
what you don't want is for the scale to be weighted against you and for the merchant and the

186
00:35:33.439 --> 00:35:39.010
scriptures talk about how this would happen. And, and God says, I want you to know that it's not

187
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:44.989
just those weights that you need to be worried about. It's not just people trying to rip you off. I

188
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.030
want you to be concerned about your life. And he says that I wanna weigh you.

189
00:35:55.489 --> 00:36:04.659
I want to put you on a scale. I want to measure what your life looks like. I want to see how you're

190
00:36:04.669 --> 00:36:11.909
able to meet the standard that has been set. It's interesting, right? We're always so obsessed and

191
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:19.790
concerned about others, but we don't realize that that same measure by which we are applying to

192
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:26.889
others is also being applied to us. And so God says, I want you to be aware of this and I want you

193
00:36:26.899 --> 00:36:34.330
to be concerned about this. But I also want you to understand that there is a way to experience this

194
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:41.840
that maybe you haven't considered just yet. I think we've all scrolled enough on social media to see

195
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:48.449
that there are random acts of kindness that are getting a lot of views these days, people are

196
00:36:48.459 --> 00:36:54.850
funding acts of kindness. I didn't think this could be a thing, but it's a thing where people are

197
00:36:54.860 --> 00:37:02.199
giving people money to be kind to other people. Have you seen this literally tens of thousands of

198
00:37:02.209 --> 00:37:10.310
dollars where people are getting a car, people are getting a house. People are actually paying off

199
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:18.469
debts or able to do things like pay for someone's operation and it's all because of the acts of

200
00:37:18.479 --> 00:37:26.870
kindness. One person representing everyone else who is financially supporting that act of kindness

201
00:37:26.889 --> 00:37:34.100
so that person can get off the street, get that operation, stop having to ride their bike finally

202
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:42.590
live in a nice place. And then there's those other acts of kindness where you're asked to make a

203
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:53.770
choice. It's like get this or give it away, take the $500 or give it to someone else. And you

204
00:37:53.780 --> 00:38:00.429
sometimes see people who take it and then others who give it away. Sometimes when they take it, they

205
00:38:00.439 --> 00:38:06.449
could have received even more, but they didn't know that because it was a social experiment meant to

206
00:38:06.459 --> 00:38:14.330
prove that sometimes what you take instead of giving away can actually be less than what happens

207
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:21.570
when you act kindly to others, even though you would be in need yourself. I think we've all seen

208
00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:30.010
these things and have kind of had a reaction towards that. I wanna tell you a story that is found in

209
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:38.969
the scriptures and it has to do with the life of King Saul. And as we look at the life of King Saul,

210
00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:45.360
I'm going to ask that you would just read this passage with me and we're gonna read through the

211
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:50.939
whole thing. And then we're gonna continue with our talking and you'll see it in first Samuel 18

212
00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:58.030
verses 1 to 16. I want you to get a full grasp of what we're looking at today. It says that David

213
00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.229
had finished talking with Saul and he met Jonathan the king's son and there was an immediate bond

214
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:11.379
between them because Jonathan loved David. And from that day on Saul kept David with him and he

215
00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:17.540
wouldn't let him return home. And then Jonathan made a solemn pact with David because he loved him

216
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:25.860
as he loved himself. And then Jonathan sealed the pack by taking off his robe and giving it to David

217
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:33.560
together with his tunic, his sword, his bow and his belt, and whatever Saul asked David to do, well,

218
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:41.919
David did it successfully. And so Saul made him a commander over the men of war, an appointment that

219
00:39:41.929 --> 00:39:50.169
was welcomed by the people and Saul's officers alike. And when the victorious Israelite army was

220
00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:57.090
returning home after David had killed the Philistine women from all the towns of Israel came out to

221
00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:04.729
meet King Saul and they sang and they danced for joy with tambourines and even with Cymbals. And

222
00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:11.879
this was their song that Saul has killed his thousands and David his 10 thousands. And this made

223
00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:19.909
Saul very angry. What's this? He said? And, and they credit David with 10 thousands and me with only

224
00:40:19.919 --> 00:40:28.810
thousands. And next, they'll be making him their king. And so from that time on, Saul kept a jealous

225
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:37.199
eye on David. And the, and the very next day, there was a tormenting spirit from God that

226
00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:45.919
overwhelmed Saul and he began to rave in his house like a madman. David was playing the harp as he

227
00:40:45.929 --> 00:40:54.590
did each day. But Saul had a spear in his hand and then he suddenly hurled it at David intending to

228
00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:03.860
pin him to the wall. But David escaped him twice. And Saul was then afraid of David for the Lord was

229
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:11.409
with David and had turned away from Saul. And then finally, Saul sent him away and he appointed him

230
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:18.780
commander over 1000 men. And David faithfully led his troops into battle. And David continued to

231
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.840
succeed in everything that he did for the Lord was with him. And when Saul recognized this, he

232
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:31.219
became even more afraid of him. But all Israel and Judah loved David because he was so successful at

233
00:41:31.229 --> 00:41:37.790
leading his troops into battle. Now, in the story, we're gonna see uh something that maybe we hadn't

234
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:43.899
noticed before. And that is that uh David actually knew Saul before he even went into battle against

235
00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:44.520
Goliath.

236
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.290
A lot of people don't pick up on this. And so I want to highlight this because it's an important,

237
00:41:52.300 --> 00:42:00.949
important point today when we want to defeat giants in our life, it is important to stay faithful to

238
00:42:00.959 --> 00:42:04.310
God, regardless of the attacks that we're experiencing beforehand.

239
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:14.320
And you'll see that Saul is trying to take David out even before he takes Goliath out. And there's

240
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.870
something there for us to consider and to ponder because I think that our greatest acts of kindness

241
00:42:19.879 --> 00:42:26.639
are actually ahead of us and our most powerful moments are before us instead of us reflecting and

242
00:42:26.649 --> 00:42:33.129
thinking that they are behind us in the story in which we're in. We see that there's other events

243
00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:37.790
that are happening. And one of them is that there is this bond that is forged and formed between

244
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:43.550
Jonathan and David, a friendship that is so close that they make a pact with one another. They are

245
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.790
instantly connected. And I think we can relate to that because there are times when we really

246
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:53.290
connect with people, like we feel like we've met our person like this is a person that we wanna do

247
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:58.629
life with. And it's heartbreaking when we can't do it with them. And this is what was happening

248
00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:05.070
between David and Jonathan. They wanted to be with each other, be friends, be in each other's

249
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:13.020
company. But there was always this other person between them that was making them feel always like

250
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:22.360
this was not the right thing and that was King Song. It kept interfering with their relationship,

251
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:30.969
but more than that, it was interfering in a way that Saul had no idea was before him. The thing

252
00:43:30.979 --> 00:43:38.729
about this story is that David was spending time in the palace because Jonathan was his best friend

253
00:43:38.739 --> 00:43:45.110
and, and then he was also going home and, and what's cool to think about in the story is that as

254
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.739
we're looking at this happening, as it's being described here in between those times in which David

255
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:57.479
could have stayed in the kingdom and in the palace, he had to go back home to still be a shepherd.

256
00:43:59.649 --> 00:44:06.229
And while he was serving his household and serving his father, Jesse and, and, and serving all of

257
00:44:06.239 --> 00:44:13.489
his brothers as the youngest in his household, he was also having experiences where he had to come

258
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:20.610
up against the bear and the lion, which were preparations for the time in which he would have to

259
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:30.270
come up against Goliath. And, and so while he found himself between two worlds, two places and not

260
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:40.050
fitting in either one of them God was still with David. He was still blessing him, preparing him. He

261
00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:46.520
was still making sure that he would turn out to be the person and the leader that he needed to be.

262
00:44:47.149 --> 00:44:54.260
And think about how often in our own lives we find ourselves in between things and how we don't feel

263
00:44:54.270 --> 00:45:00.360
welcome sometimes in either of those places. And David no longer felt at home in the palace. He

264
00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:08.939
never felt at home, even in his own home. I think one of the greatest things about life is that we

265
00:45:08.949 --> 00:45:11.010
get to say this phrase, I'm going home

266
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:18.770
and just saying it brings me a measure and a level of safety and peace and security that sometimes

267
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.530
this world cannot afford me. Anybody else feel like that just being able to say it. I mean, it

268
00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.129
doesn't matter what your home looks like, it doesn't matter what kind of disorder you're going into,

269
00:45:27.139 --> 00:45:31.899
it doesn't matter what kind of conflict that might be there. It is still better than anything else

270
00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:37.959
that is out there. There is a sense of home that we get when we say we're going home and imagine

271
00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:44.449
being in a place in your life where nothing feels like home. That's what David was living, except in

272
00:45:44.459 --> 00:45:52.459
his friendship with Jonathan. That's where he felt at home. And so his home became a person, you

273
00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:57.689
know, and it's interesting because in his place of, of kindness, the kindness that he was

274
00:45:57.699 --> 00:46:03.530
experiencing it was from someone who had to also choose between honoring his father or honoring his

275
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:10.010
friend. And what, what Jonathan was, was doing was was put, he was put in an impossible situation.

276
00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:15.790
But you see, it wasn't always this complicated because there was a moment in which Saul was being

277
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:25.139
ruled by kindness. In fact, the Bible tells us that that's exactly what happened when he makes a

278
00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:32.239
decision for David, he made it increasingly more difficult for David to actually go home. And so we

279
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:39.850
see that he gets ruled by kindness, but for his son. And, and that's why I wanna read to you this

280
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:48.209
verse where it says that from that day on Saul kept David with him and wouldn't let him return home.

281
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:55.250
And he, the Bible tells us that he did this because in the previous verse, there was an immediate

282
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:02.280
bond between them. For Jonathan loved David and David loved Jonathan. The Bible tells us that

283
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:10.800
because of that bond and because of the impact that it was also having in his household, Saul made a

284
00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:17.870
decision and that decision was he was going to be ruled by kindness, but for his son. And, and I

285
00:47:17.879 --> 00:47:23.419
think that we understand this, there are things that we do for our kids, those of us who have them

286
00:47:23.689 --> 00:47:30.120
that you wouldn't do for anybody else. There's a measure of, of sacrifice and tolerance and

287
00:47:30.129 --> 00:47:36.060
acceptance. There's, there's things that you would do. You know for your kids that you wouldn't do

288
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:40.500
for anyone else. I think we understand that. And if we haven't literally experienced that, well, we,

289
00:47:41.389 --> 00:47:47.360
we still know this to be true when a person is good. When they, when they're a loving father, a

290
00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:53.000
loving mother, when that person really wants to give everything to their Children, we know that this

291
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:58.979
is right. And instinctually we know that if ever we have that opportunity that we would be this way

292
00:47:58.989 --> 00:48:05.000
too, that we could maybe correct the things of the past that we didn't get to experience in our own

293
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:10.449
life, but that we would be able to be different in the way that we would deal not only with our

294
00:48:10.489 --> 00:48:16.850
Children but someone else's child, maybe in a blended home in a blended family, maybe even in a

295
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:25.199
situation where you are fostering or where you are there to care and be a neighbor and a friend to

296
00:48:25.209 --> 00:48:31.620
someone else's child and be that person who mentors them and equips them and helps them and even

297
00:48:31.629 --> 00:48:39.399
sometimes financially supports them because this is the acts of kindness that God has put on your

298
00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:49.429
own heart to do. Well, the Bible says that Saul took the steps to be kind for her son and wanted

299
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:57.129
David to be in his house. There's a second instance in where Saul was still being in kind. It tells

300
00:48:57.139 --> 00:49:03.500
us that he was ruled by kindness even for his people. The Bible says that David even before he

301
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:10.800
became jealous of him, he was also proud of him and he was proud of having David in his house and in

302
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:16.149
his household, he was proud of who David was and what he was doing and what he was accomplishing.

303
00:49:16.399 --> 00:49:22.500
And in verse five, it says that whatever Saul asked David to do, David did it successfully. So why

304
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:30.300
wouldn't you want someone like this in your house under your command? It's like he's the best person

305
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:39.709
to have around. He's a person who not only listens but executes every task you give him, he does it

306
00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:48.360
exceptionally well. It brings success every time he touches whatever it is that he's given. And so

307
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:54.729
Paul in this story, Saul, excuse me, different guy, different story. I don't know where I went with

308
00:49:54.739 --> 00:50:06.750
that, but Saul made him a commander over the men of war. And what he does is that he appoints him as

309
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:13.020
someone who's going to be in charge of his army. And what's cool about this is that he, he didn't

310
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:22.419
even trust him before um to go and fight against the Goliath. But now he's trusting him with his

311
00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:30.709
armies. And we can see that what David has done is that he has continuously grown also in the eyes

312
00:50:30.719 --> 00:50:37.800
of Saul. And then we do that too. Like we recognize talent when we see it. But we also see the

313
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:44.600
Brokenness that sometimes accompanies that talent. We see someone as being raw and unrefined.

314
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:54.760
Someone who's has as much to unlearn as they have learned. Thank someone who is changing. But man,

315
00:50:54.770 --> 00:51:01.739
is there still a lot of change that needs to take place? Someone who has a lot of potential but

316
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:09.379
hasn't yet achieved it to the level that they could because there are still things holding them back.

317
00:51:09.479 --> 00:51:14.639
Have you ever identified that in yourself and in others, of course, you have because we are better

318
00:51:14.649 --> 00:51:21.120
scouts than we realize we are better at rating people than we give ourselves credit for. The problem

319
00:51:21.129 --> 00:51:26.729
is that we don't pay attention to our instincts. We don't pay attention to our experience and we

320
00:51:26.739 --> 00:51:34.500
certainly don't always pay attention to the Holy Spirit that's warning us and guiding us as we find

321
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:42.520
ourselves in front of people. Well, Saul still has the spirit of God with him and he sees that he's

322
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:47.149
got a good thing with David. So he makes sure that not only is it a good thing for him, he's a good

323
00:51:47.159 --> 00:51:53.320
thing for his son. It's a good thing for his palace. It's a good thing for his kingdom. It's a good

324
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:59.669
thing for his army. He's seeing how all of the things that David is good at is also bringing him

325
00:51:59.679 --> 00:52:08.389
success. And this tells us that no one can rule a kingdom and no one can experience success in their

326
00:52:08.399 --> 00:52:17.350
life, which is your kingdom unless you are blessed and surrounded by kindness and kind people. And

327
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:25.709
people who are consecrated and dedicated and committed to serving the Lord. You have those people in

328
00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:31.620
your life. You don't wanna lose them. You don't wanna see them go back home, you don't wanna see

329
00:52:31.629 --> 00:52:38.310
them, not be around your child. You don't wanna see that influence, not there. You want your son to

330
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.870
become the next best king that he can be. So you're gonna make sure that David is gonna spend as

331
00:52:42.879 --> 00:52:48.739
much time with Jonathan as possible because he's such a good influence on him and you're gonna see

332
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:52.899
these things and you're gonna notice these things, you're gonna recognize these things, not only in

333
00:52:52.909 --> 00:52:58.540
yourself but in those around you, but there comes a moment where David stops

334
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:13.459
caring about what Saul thinks and just starts caring only about what God thinks. And I think that's

335
00:53:13.469 --> 00:53:25.879
a big, big differentiator for us today. I think many of us stop being successful because we start

336
00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:38.189
caring too much about the person who we thought we could respect and honor and give our lives

337
00:53:38.199 --> 00:53:39.030
towards

338
00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:48.989
because now they're turning against us. And I don't know how David does it, to be honest, I mean,

339
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.330
when someone is for you, it's easy to serve that person. But when they turn against you, like, how

340
00:53:54.340 --> 00:54:04.709
do you keep serving? How do you keep being kind when someone hates you so much and is so jealous of

341
00:54:04.719 --> 00:54:14.489
you? How do you keep being successful? And then I think what David shows us is that his success

342
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:24.419
wasn't dependent on Saul. His success was dependent on the God who appointed Saul to be king.

343
00:54:26.909 --> 00:54:32.370
And I want you to think about that in your own life. Like if you're not experiencing the measure of

344
00:54:32.379 --> 00:54:37.639
success that you know, you should have at this point in your life, maybe it has something to do with

345
00:54:37.649 --> 00:54:43.530
you keeping your eye on men and women in your life instead of the Lord God Almighty,

346
00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:55.800
instead of having his favor, you've been seeking out the favor of others above that of the Lord.

347
00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:07.699
So there's something that happens in Saul's life. It's a turning point from Saul. The turning point

348
00:55:07.709 --> 00:55:15.699
is that he's now ruled by kindness, but he's ruled by kindness. But for himself, he, he stopped

349
00:55:15.709 --> 00:55:22.639
being ruled by kindness, for his son. And he stopped being ruled for by kindness, for his people

350
00:55:23.139 --> 00:55:29.449
because his people praised him when he did these things and put David in charge of his armies, all

351
00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:36.149
of his counselors were like, that's a good choice. You're doing the right thing. There's no one

352
00:55:36.159 --> 00:55:42.340
better than David in our kingdom. But then there's a moment in which he starts to think more about

353
00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:50.479
himself. And then the Bible says that this can happen to all of us. And we've got to watch out for

354
00:55:50.489 --> 00:55:57.600
this turning point because this is where things turn away from kindness and towards jealousy instead.

355
00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:04.770
Now, if you haven't paid attention to anything I've said up until now now is the time to wake up and

356
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:12.060
to start paying attention. Are you with me? Are you with me? OK.

357
00:56:15.439 --> 00:56:25.239
Because now all of a sudden, Saul starts to think about himself and not for the better. In verse

358
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:33.959
eight, it says that Saul became very angry about the way that people loved David more than him. And

359
00:56:33.969 --> 00:56:42.510
they were making songs about him and they were attributing battles to him that were not being

360
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:53.649
attributed to Saul, where David was being talked about for his victory over 10 thousands and only

361
00:56:53.659 --> 00:57:02.989
thousands for Saul. And it says that from that moment on Saul kept a jealous eye on David. And it

362
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.929
says that the very next morning, an evil spirit came into him. Now I want you to see the shift and

363
00:57:10.939 --> 00:57:16.699
then what happens now we think that, you know, sometimes there are going to be moments in my life

364
00:57:16.709 --> 00:57:20.959
where I'm going to be jealous and times when I'm going to be envious times where I'm not obviously

365
00:57:20.969 --> 00:57:27.830
going to be kind and times where that I'm not going to be at my best. But what we don't imagine and

366
00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:35.550
what we don't see what we don't envision is that an evil spirit can actually accompany that. The

367
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:42.500
story that we're in tells us a very, very important warning is saying, hey, listen, you leave

368
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:49.860
jealousy unchecked. You don't know this. But what happens next is that something evil comes in you.

369
00:57:49.879 --> 00:57:53.250
And the next thing you know, you are raving like a madman.

370
00:57:55.909 --> 00:58:05.610
It is that insidious. It is that unnoticeable. It is so hidden to your perceptions, but it isn't in

371
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:12.969
terms of your reactions. The Bible says that Saul wasn't even aware that this was happening to him.

372
00:58:12.979 --> 00:58:19.120
All he knew was that he was different and he was getting angrier and evil. He was, I don't even know

373
00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:25.469
if eviler is a word. But he was, he was just getting worse. He wasn't getting any better. And I

374
00:58:25.479 --> 00:58:32.219
think that sometimes we notice that shift in us. Like, why am I obsessing over this? Come on. Have you

375
00:58:32.229 --> 00:58:41.590
ever obsessed over a person like obsessed over an event and, and did that somehow maybe lead to, to,

376
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:47.989
to a level of, of just jealousy and envy and anger and hatred. And then all of a sudden you're not

377
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.850
the same person anymore. You don't even realize why you are the way you are. But it's because of the

378
00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.340
way those thoughts have been leading you down this path. And now you look at yourself and you're

379
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:05.239
unrecognizable to yourself and people look at you and they're not telling you to your face but they,

380
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.409
they, they want to tell you you're crazy.

381
00:59:09.959 --> 00:59:15.120
They do, they want to tell you, they want to shout it in your face. You're acting crazy and

382
00:59:15.129 --> 00:59:21.060
sometimes the most bold among us will, will love a person enough to say, hey, you're acting crazy

383
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:26.739
right now, you're being crazy. Your thoughts are driving you crazy and you're driving me crazy too.

384
00:59:28.229 --> 00:59:34.209
Sometimes a person will tell us that we're obsessing about the wrong things and we're not putting

385
00:59:34.219 --> 00:59:41.449
the emphasis on the right things that we're putting our attention on persons and people instead of

386
00:59:41.459 --> 00:59:49.560
the Lord and the success that he alone can bring and the kindness that he can restore and the

387
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:56.500
spirits that he can cast out and the good things that he can bring back in to take their place where

388
00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:02.939
he can increase and we decrease and the things that are wrong leave us and we never pay attention to

389
01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:10.530
them again because we're having too much success going forward. God is saying, do you want your life

390
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:17.739
to be different? Well, then let's learn from from Saul's life. The Bible says that here is David who

391
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:24.449
always played music in the palace, always sang songs. He always did this. He wasn't doing anything

392
01:00:24.459 --> 01:00:34.570
different. But now Saul needs it for a different purpose. Saul now needs David to sing songs and to

393
01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.969
play music because the evil in Him is increasing.

394
01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:45.250
And the only way that he can somehow have moments of sanity

395
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:54.020
from the every moments of madness is when David is worshiping the Lord

396
01:00:56.899 --> 01:01:03.159
and, and it's, and it's really bad. You know, you're far gone when you can't worship the Lord

397
01:01:03.169 --> 01:01:07.879
yourself and you need to be in the presence of only someone else who can, you know, there's

398
01:01:07.889 --> 01:01:13.860
something wrong within you and something wrong with you and you know that things are not right when

399
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:20.469
you don't miss the house of the Lord. When you don't miss worshiping the Lord, when you don't miss

400
01:01:20.479 --> 01:01:26.139
being in communion and fellowship with, with Jesus, you know, there's something that's not right

401
01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:32.449
with us when we don't care about those things when they don't matter to us. But then when we're in

402
01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:41.560
the presence of it, it touches us, it impacts us. We get feels, we get feelings and I'm like, what

403
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:49.100
is this? What's happening? How come I'm reacting? How come I'm responding? How come, how come it's

404
01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:55.939
in this moment when someone else is worshiping that this is happening. And I want you to understand

405
01:01:55.949 --> 01:02:02.570
that God wants you to get to the place where your worship is no longer dependent on what's happening

406
01:02:02.989 --> 01:02:10.290
at River's edge or another church. It isn't happening because of the person you're listening to or

407
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:16.600
the music that you're following. It is happening because you have a relationship with the living God

408
01:02:16.949 --> 01:02:18.399
and his name is Jesus Christ

409
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:27.510
and wherever you are, wherever you go, it doesn't matter what other people are doing, what they're

410
01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.280
saying, what, what's happening, what matters is, what's happening in you. You see kindness isn't

411
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:43.100
something that is done to you. Kindness is what comes out of you and kindness comes out of you. Even

412
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:51.949
when people are throwing spears at you. The scripture say that, that David had to evade the spears

413
01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:52.830
of Saul.

414
01:02:55.189 --> 01:03:00.850
And then when that happened, you know what David realizes? He realizes that God is with him,

415
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:08.020
protecting him and that he needs to keep doing what he's doing. You know what Saul realizes? Saul

416
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.459
realizes that God is with David and he isn't with him.

417
01:03:13.719 --> 01:03:20.310
Saul makes the most important realization in his life. He's like every time I try to kill David, I

418
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.840
can't do it. Every time I set him up for failure, he just has more success. Every time I hate him

419
01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:37.500
more that guy prospers. Every time I try to kill him, he becomes bigger than life. Wow, that tells

420
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:45.500
me that I wanna be the person who lives out the kindness of Jesus Christ no matter what the

421
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:53.679
circumstances of my life are. And what this story reminds us is that we have to be aware and awake

422
01:03:54.030 --> 01:04:02.290
so that we don't do the very things that Saul here is doing. Imagine that when your observations

423
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.560
change from kindness to jealousy

424
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.709
that we can sometimes not even perceive it, not even notice that it's happening.

425
01:04:18.389 --> 01:04:25.060
I mean, I don't know what your level of tolerance is for people, maybe changes depending on what

426
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:32.889
you're going through. But I, I've always admired people who could just sit with someone and just

427
01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:43.110
listen to them and just just hear their story. Sometimes them repeat that story over and over and

428
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:51.560
over again, I watched my mom do this with, with her mom. It got to a point where my grandmother had

429
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:58.719
uh dementia and she was just repeating herself. Have you ever dealt with someone like that? And, and

430
01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:04.530
I saw my mom with such tenderness and kindness, even though she had heard the stories just a few

431
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:10.969
seconds ago, kept reacting with kindness as low. She had just said it for the very first time

432
01:05:11.969 --> 01:05:18.540
because for my grandmother in her mind in her life, she was saying it for the first time

433
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:26.070
and, and I looked at that and I said, I will never be like that.

434
01:05:29.219 --> 01:05:36.010
I will never be able to do that. And now I listen to people for a living because because it was

435
01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:44.050
modeled for me in my own home. I, I'm a person who listens more than talks because I saw what it

436
01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:51.679
meant to be with someone who kept talking all the time and how important it was to just listen. You

437
01:05:51.689 --> 01:05:57.040
know, when you listen, you create gaps where you don't realize this. But people reveal more.

438
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.739
The silences that you provide are moments where they decide that this is a moment that they can fill

439
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.100
with some more information.

440
01:06:08.739 --> 01:06:14.199
And over and over again, you're going to realize that that what God wants to do is he wants to turn

441
01:06:14.209 --> 01:06:24.540
your heart away from jealousy and towards kindness, instead away from frustration, away from hatred.

442
01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:32.129
And he wants you to have a heart that is kind. Listen, this story tells me something really

443
01:06:32.139 --> 01:06:38.739
important and I, and I hope they put this on the screen because I think it's really key jealousy

444
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:44.159
will make you believe that God is more for others than He is for you.

445
01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.939
Because if you're spending so much time thinking about another person, that means you think that God

446
01:06:51.949 --> 01:06:53.139
is not spending any time on you

447
01:06:55.979 --> 01:06:57.840
and you, you've already bought into the line,

448
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:05.800
you already believe that God cares about someone else more than he cares about you. And, and if you

449
01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:09.729
believe that, then, well, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna walk in the direction of that

450
01:07:09.739 --> 01:07:20.750
line and, and instead of you becoming a kinder person, you're just gonna become more jealous and God

451
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:27.260
wants to disrupt that in your life. He wants to change that. And here's the next thing I want to

452
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:35.840
tell you is that Saul's grip on success got weaker and David's grip became stronger

453
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.820
every time Saul became jealous.

454
01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:54.659
Saul's jealousy actually made David more successful. The anointing that was on Saul, the

455
01:07:54.669 --> 01:07:58.260
Bible tells us, gets transferred to David

456
01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:05.870
even before he stops being king. Hey, I don't know about you, but I don't want that to happen in my

457
01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:16.779
life. I, I don't want God to bless someone else because I can get my act together because I am too

458
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:24.180
busy being jealous and hating and I'm too busy having murderous thoughts and throwing spears at

459
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:32.769
people so that other people hate that person. As much as I do see, we don't realize it, but when

460
01:08:32.778 --> 01:08:35.628
we're jealous, that's what we're doing. We're throwing spears.

461
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:42.830
But God doesn't want you to be. That person. Doesn't want you to act this way because what he's

462
01:08:42.839 --> 01:08:47.910
trying to tell us that if you want someone to be more successful, then just start becoming jealous

463
01:08:47.919 --> 01:08:50.160
of them. OK?

464
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:58.640
Who wants to, who wants to fulfill this outcome? Here? Anybody in the room? I want you to think

465
01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:07.200
about this because every time you become jealous of someone, God is saying I'm gonna make them more

466
01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:16.810
successful so that you understand the jealousy isn't. What is going to get you successful? Kindness

467
01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:23.599
is, can we say amen to that? Come on. Are you guys ready to do some of this stuff or what? I know

468
01:09:23.608 --> 01:09:28.949
it's not gonna be easy. I know, I know that we're gonna take all of our effort. But here's the thing.

469
01:09:29.128 --> 01:09:38.490
Whatever our effort comes up short, the presence of God takes over and takes us the rest of the way.

470
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:48.520
If you want God to bless you, then you've got to be ruled by kindness that has to become the next

471
01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:59.810
thing that becomes your obsession. Whatever you've been obsessing about, stop and start obsessing

472
01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:06.439
about kindness. Can we say amen to that? Start obsessing about kindness when you start obsessing

473
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:12.580
about kindness? Here's what's gonna happen. God is gonna give you more success. He's gonna have no

474
01:10:12.589 --> 01:10:20.080
time to bless others because he'd be too busy. Blessing you too busy making your life amazing, too

475
01:10:20.089 --> 01:10:26.509
busy giving you more because you can be trusted with it. Too busy giving you the kinds of successes

476
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:32.569
that people will sing songs about you. Who wants a song named after them? Anybody here, it may not

477
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:37.819
be your goal in life. But, but if it happens, you're like, wow, yeah, I'll take that.

478
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:46.290
And then when people ask you one day and they'll say, hey, how come you are so successful today?

479
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:53.410
You'll be able to say what you see. There was a day when I chose to stop being jealous. God bless

480
01:10:53.419 --> 01:10:54.529
you guys. Thank you so much

481
01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:08.979
as we would just stand for a moment and just close in a word of prayer. I'm gonna ask the team to

482
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:15.180
put up one verse on the screen for us to be able to look at together. And this verse is a

483
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:27.660
preparation for our time of prayer. It's Proverbs 11 17. It says your kindness will reward you, but

484
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:29.649
your cruelty will destroy you.

485
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:38.270
And God is saying I want to reward you. I wanna bless you. Hey, II I am. Here's, here's what I love

486
01:11:38.279 --> 01:11:45.129
about God. You know who God is obsessed about us. I don't need to be obsessed about me. I don't need

487
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:51.040
to be obsessed about because God is obsessed about me. He's obsessed about you. He loves you that

488
01:11:51.049 --> 01:11:55.910
much. He wants to bless you no matter the hardships that you've gone through. He still wants to do

489
01:11:55.919 --> 01:12:02.709
that. And I believe that today is an opportunity for us to experience that reward as we would pray

490
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.799
for it. Instead, you guys ready to do that with me. And so father, we come before you and we ask

491
01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:15.040
that you would just would continue to be loving and generous towards us. Thank you that we can come

492
01:12:15.049 --> 01:12:21.879
before you and just confess our jealousy and our, and our hatred and our anger and our moments where

493
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:27.810
we are throwing spears and have thrown them in the past God. The moments where we have not lived up

494
01:12:27.819 --> 01:12:39.540
to the standard of kindness that you have asked us to display to live out. Lord, you want us to

495
01:12:39.549 --> 01:12:46.810
experience an unprecedented measure of success because you want your name to be known and glorified

496
01:12:46.819 --> 01:12:54.330
so that when we are asked, what made us so successful, we can say that we were blessed by you. Lord,

497
01:12:54.339 --> 01:13:00.169
I pray that today would be a turning point for all of us that we would leave our jealousy behind and

498
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:05.879
that we would be clothed with your kindness. Instead, we have learned from the principles of this

499
01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:12.069
story, Lord. And you have revealed and and just helped us understand the events and how they took

500
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:21.589
place and how David was able to slay giants because of how you were always with him. Lord be with us

501
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:32.470
in that same measure. I parade and give us that success as we would be devoted to the kindness of

502
01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:42.750
honoring you even when others are not kind to us. And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I hope

503
01:13:42.759 --> 01:13:49.299
that blesses you guys. I hope, I hope that was a good message for you and a good talk and it helps

504
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:55.609
you throughout the week. Well, we've got um a very important song that we need to sing and, and it

505
01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:01.950
talks about being uh slaves to the past and slaves to the things that have held us back. The things

506
01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:09.479
that were called jealousy and envy and hatred and the new things that God is giving us instead that

507
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:16.759
are called kindness and love and joy and hope. And God is always ready to exchange the, the bad in

508
01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:22.430
our life for the, for the good. Are we ready to receive the good? Let's sing it together and uh

509
01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:28.109
enjoy the after party, enjoy community with one another and God bless you guys and we'll see you

510
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:34.339
next week for our Fall Fest. It's gonna be a great Sunday. We have Pastor Yvonne Masella who's

511
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:40.290
visiting from South Africa from Cape Town and she's gonna be speaking next Sunday. And if

512
01:14:40.299 --> 01:14:46.180
that's not good enough, we're also gonna have hot dogs and pumpkin pie. So we're gonna have other

513
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:52.000
things that are gonna also be fun for everyone. To enjoy. And so if you, as an adult wanna wear a

514
01:14:52.009 --> 01:14:57.450
costume or as kids wanna wear, cost, wear them have fun go with for it. We just, uh, we just ask

515
01:14:57.459 --> 01:15:02.470
that you stay away from any evil themes. We just wanna have fun. And, um, and then we just wanna

516
01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:07.509
also, um, let you know that if you do have a problem with it, like you don't, then you don't need uh

517
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:16.310
to participate. Of course. But I, I always tell um anybody who asks me um that Satan doesn't get a

518
01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:16.689
day.

519
01:15:18.979 --> 01:15:26.520
He doesn't get to have a day. Every day belongs to the Lord and every day is an opportunity for us

520
01:15:26.529 --> 01:15:36.279
to celebrate him and to honor him and to provide an alternative to what the world is offering. Amen.

521
01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:44.689
So God bless you guys and uh we'll see you soon and hopefully often thank you for that pastor. I

522
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:50.330
think one more thing that God's been teaching me and I spoke about earlier is about how God's

523
01:15:50.339 --> 01:15:57.450
perfect love casts out fear and it's in his love that we find our identity, we learn who we are and

524
01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:03.060
what his purpose is for each one of us. So as we sing the song, let's sing it as, as if we were

525
01:16:03.069 --> 01:16:07.589
singing it as a prayer and just believing that we're no longer slaves do whatever it is, whether

526
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.049
it's fear or anything in our past. And that God truly has set us free

556
01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:04.790
Thank you, worship team. Thank you Jesus. That was beautiful. You are a child of God and he cares

557
01:22:04.799 --> 01:22:10.919
about you. He has you on his heart at all times. So just carry that with you through your week. We

558
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:16.950
love you. And uh if it feels like it matters to you, it matters to him because it matters to you. So

559
01:22:16.959 --> 01:22:23.640
just know that you are a child of God and that is your identity. Um And I just want to remind you

560
01:22:23.649 --> 01:22:29.220
guys before we go to the after party that our prayer ministry, we have a prayer team that is amazing.

561
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:33.589

562
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.549

566
01:22:55.384 --> 01:23:00.064
