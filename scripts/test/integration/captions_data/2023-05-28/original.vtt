Hallelujah. Thank you

58
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:27.890
in Deuteronomy 31 6. It says be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or terrified because of them.

59
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:38.090
For the Lord, your God goes with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you because God created us.

60
00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:45.760
He not only knows our fears. But he also knows the situations that can cause fear. But we've put our

61
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:55.570
trust in him. And so we know that He never leaves us to face those fears alone. We can take comfort

62
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:01.479
in the fact that God is with us. Always let's sing this song called, not afraid,

63
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.229
not afraid of the darkness.

64
00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:27.169
I'm holding staff

65
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.619

95
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.219
Thank you for your love.

96
00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:51.479
Yes,

97
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:35.060
Great. So we're just gonna begin by dismissing the kids and thank you children for uh behaving

98
00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:44.959
and being so awesome with your teachers today. It's always good to say what you expect from, from

99
00:20:44.969 --> 00:20:51.660
those that we serve. Um And so they're going to register right now and as they do that, we're just

100
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:57.150
so glad that we have such an awesome group of teachers. And um one of the things that we're gonna do

101
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.729
today is that we're going to experience a community kitchen brunch at the end of this gathering,

102
00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:08.349
excited for that. I know it's gonna be a great gathering for us and for you as well. And so I want

103
00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:13.849
you to just, you know, take your time and getting to know people in line as you wait to get the food

104
00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:19.670
and, and as you experience that you can come back and just sit anywhere you like and, and, and

105
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.380
hopefully be around other people. But we also understand if you've got somewhere else to go, you can

106
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:31.140
also take your food to go. But we hope that you can just eat it in community right here. One of the

107
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:37.150
reasons why we do this is because we believe that Jesus is someone who not only gathers us in

108
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.739
community, but he gathers us around a table and then he talks about a banquet that one day we're all

109
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:48.219
going to be seated at and we want to just illustrate what that banquet might look like by putting on

110
00:21:48.229 --> 00:21:54.260
a banquet here once a month as a community of faith. And we really want to thank our community

111
00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:00.400
kitchen team for all their hard work and for everything that they're offering today. We have a

112
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:06.640
concert that's happening here at the church and we're just offering our space and it's a concert

113
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:16.619
that is going to benefit people in Ukraine. And it's the Aurora Chorealis concert, it's called a New Day.

114
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:22.199
And if you'd like to buy tickets. You can do that at the door at the event itself. It's going to be

115
00:22:22.209 --> 00:22:30.229
Sunday, June the fourth and it's gonna start at actually four PM. It's gonna be $20 for adults and

116
00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:37.030
then $15 for students. We have a youth ministry here at River's Edge and what we've done to kind of

117
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:44.770
build up to what we want to see accomplished in the fall is right now in the summer to start meeting

118
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:52.180
with the youth at 10 AM. So 30 minutes before the service begins. And so we want to encourage you to

119
00:22:52.189 --> 00:22:58.185
see Talita as she's going to share more about this vision of gathering the youth 30 minutes before

120
00:22:58.194 --> 00:23:04.785
the gathering and then they can participate in the gathering itself and that's going to begin next

121
00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:11.214
week. So she has important information regarding this youth ministry. And we want you to just let

122
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:16.885
others know if you know any youth that might be in the high school age, then this is going to be

123
00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:24.709
something for them. We also have a women's ministry called Girls and it's for girls of all ages and

124
00:23:24.719 --> 00:23:31.439
at all stages of life. And the uh and the event that's coming up is actually taking place on June

125
00:23:31.449 --> 00:23:37.219
the 17th. It's going to take place right here at River's Edge and there is a sign up sheet that is

126
00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:43.380
available at the cafe today. And so I want you to just head over there at the end of the gathering

127
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.250
and while you maybe you're waiting for your food, uh just, just find that sign up sheet, put your

128
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:57.250
name down because it's gonna be a wonderful spread and great study on a wonderful character in the

129
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.349
scriptures. And Patricia Godley is going to lead that gathering. We're gonna have a, a time of

130
00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:10.270
worship. So members of our worship team are gonna be there as well and just to eliminate any excuse,

131
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:17.150
child care will be provided. And so if you have any Children and you need to come with them, you're

132
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.640
more than welcome to bring them, just put that down on the sign up sheet. So we know how many

133
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:30.630
Children to prepare for and we will definitely do that with joy, take care of them as you get

134
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:37.609
spiritually nourished for this women's event. We also want to make you aware of a worship night

135
00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:45.319
that's coming up and it's gonna be on Friday, June the 23rd and this is an event that's open to this

136
00:24:45.329 --> 00:24:51.800
city and over 100 and plus people gather when we've been doing it. And so we're excited to offer it

137
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:56.479
again and it's going to happen on June the 23rd. And so if you're looking for a night where you can

138
00:24:56.489 --> 00:25:02.430
just spend time and worship, this is going to be a night in which they generally uh the band

139
00:25:02.439 --> 00:25:09.849
prepares somewhere around 18 songs. And so it's a great night of continuous worship and it's going

140
00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:16.040
to happen on June the 23rd. We also have our tech team and our tech team is also looking for new

155
00:26:54.890 --> 00:27:01.500
what's not only happening, but also coming up in the weeks to come. So there's a lot going on and I

156
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:07.380
haven't even shared at all. But uh I want to also just remind you that, you know, we, we operate and

157
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:12.359
we function with donations. And so whatever you can give, you got four ways that you can make a

158
00:27:12.369 --> 00:27:18.079
donation today. We just appreciate what you have done in the past, what you can do today and in the

159
00:27:18.089 --> 00:27:24.400
weeks to come and God bless you in your generosity. So we're gonna move now and transition into our

160
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:31.709
message. And um I'm going to be speaking on the topic of trust. And so let's just uh take a moment

161
00:27:31.719 --> 00:27:36.810
to just shift our attention to that. And uh we are going to begin

162
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:59.920
when we talk about trust, we're talking about something that is really easy to give out the people

163
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:12.670
that we feel comfortable with. We tend to trust people that we have connections with people that we

164
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:22.430
click with people that tend to offer us some kind of comfort when we meet them. And we can sometimes

165
00:28:22.439 --> 00:28:31.709
share details with complete strangers. Go into sometimes the most traumatic events of our life with

166
00:28:31.719 --> 00:28:37.750
people that we've never even met before because there's just something about that moment that tells

167
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:44.180
you that this is someone that you can trust with this information and then you discover you were

168
00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:49.560
completely wrong. Anybody else have that experience, you just read them wrong, you read the

169
00:28:49.569 --> 00:28:55.420
situation wrong, you felt entirely comfortable, you let your guard down and then, you know, they,

170
00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:01.989
they just destroyed that, that trust. And, um, you know, there's things about trust that we, I think

171
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.920
we can honestly relate to and, and other things that can, can just, you know, just remind us of some,

172
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:15.150
some pretty bad situations and circumstances in our life. I think that when someone, you know, does

173
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:21.750
something to have us lose our trust in them, it's really hard to, to regain it. Right. It's really

174
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:28.109
hard for us to open up and to, and to trust in them again. In fact, researchers have often looked at

175
00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:33.060
the issue of trust and there was a study that was done even at Penn State University in the United

176
00:29:33.069 --> 00:29:40.479
States and they asked people to document for 30 days, all the things that they would worry about.

177
00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:46.839
And as they did that for 30 days, they then asked them to do another exercise after they had written

178
00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:55.319
down what they were worried about over a period of 30 days, they said, now write down the things

179
00:29:55.329 --> 00:30:04.670
that actually came to pass. And at the end of those 30 days, less than 10% of what they had worried

180
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:13.189
about actually came true. And what's interesting about that is that obviously over 90% of what we

181
00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:23.069
worry about never comes to pass, but less than 10% of what we worry about will happen. And what that

182
00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:34.040
means is that worry will always rob you 100% of the time. 100% of the time, worry will rob you of

183
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:41.439
your peace. And if we're trying to experience peace, we're trying to get a handle on the things that

184
00:30:41.449 --> 00:30:47.589
bring worry into our lives. And I know that there's a lot of things that can keep us up at night,

185
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:54.859
things that can keep us awake when we want to be sleeping instead. And I know that that happens to

186
00:30:54.869 --> 00:31:02.020
me. Sometimes I can't shut my mind off. Has anyone else just like grabbed their phone when that

187
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:09.489
happens and just scrolled for the next hour on social media just trying to fall back asleep. Does

188
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:17.680
anyone? No, just me? Ok. Thanks for being honest. Uh and make me feel even more inadequate. Um

189
00:31:17.689 --> 00:31:25.400
Appreciate that. But I do know that when I do stay awake and I can't get back to sleep, I know that

190
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:33.459
during that time that I'm awake, I am not trying to manage or to discover a way to restore my peace

191
00:31:33.469 --> 00:31:41.260
or to bring joy into my life. See, I'm using that time in the wrong way, I'm awake and I'm not

192
00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:47.319
trying to restore peace. I'm not trying to restore joy. What I'm doing is I'm perpetuating the worry.

193
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:52.510
And the thing about that is that I'm awake worrying about things that are completely out of my

194
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.689
control and I think we understand that, but yet it's hard to just stop doing it. I'm thinking about

195
00:31:59.699 --> 00:32:08.599
the very things that are going to get worse and not better. I'm almost in a manner predicting the

196
00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:15.270
worst outcome to actually come to pass by thinking about it so much because the more I think about

197
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:21.770
it, my life starts to go in the direction of what I'm worried about. I'm almost the one who's

198
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:30.239
sometimes responsible for fulfilling my very prophecy of worry. The thing that I'm most concerned

199
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:36.540
about now, I, I, sometimes I stay up at night and I, and I worry about the friends that my kids have

200
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:44.729
and sometimes I, I worry about the fact that I have health concerns. Sometimes I, I used to stay up

201
00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:49.869
at night worrying about my aging parents and, and, and, and now that they're no longer there, I

202
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:56.939
worry about the fact that I don't have parents. Sometimes I worry about the wars that are taking

203
00:32:56.949 --> 00:33:02.750
place. I worry about acts of terrorism that we read about. I, I worry about the murder in the

204
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:09.369
streets that are taking place in broad daylight and restaurants. I worry about racism and economy. I,

205
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:15.939
I worry about all of those things. I worry about inflation. Has anyone noticed the price of eggs?

206
00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:25.369
Lately. Can anyone even eat butter anymore? I don't know. It's ridiculous. I, I worry about those

207
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:31.390
things. I worry about the interest rate. I worry and I, and I think that the difference between

208
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:40.130
worry and anxiety can sometimes get confused in my own mind. And while I can't have any control over

209
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:49.630
these things, I know that anxiety and worry are related. I know that they overlap. I know that

210
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:58.650
they're different but yet somehow they speak to me about the same thing. And what I've come to

211
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:07.310
understand is that we worry in our minds, but then we experience anxiety in our bodies.

212
00:34:09.928 --> 00:34:15.898
And so when I talk about worry, I'm not really talking about anxiety, but I'm talking about how

213
00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:25.179
worry can lead me to a place where I'm experiencing anxiety where that anxiety can affect me in ways

214
00:34:25.189 --> 00:34:32.360
that it brings me to a place where I am no longer able to distinguish between the two.

215
00:34:34.398 --> 00:34:42.148
And so worry is if I could clarify, it is something quite specific, I went through the list earlier

216
00:34:42.158 --> 00:34:46.819
of some of the things that I worry about and maybe those aren't your concerns, maybe those aren't

217
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:54.500
your worries. But worry is specific. You can actually name what it is that you're worried about. But

218
00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:02.719
anxiety is widespread, it just doesn't just affect you physically, but it begins to affect your,

219
00:35:02.729 --> 00:35:14.520
your functioning in your everyday life. And so worry, we now understand leads to anxiety. And so if

220
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:19.389
if you don't want to be an anxious person, then you have to get a handle on what you're worrying

221
00:35:19.399 --> 00:35:27.739
about. And, and that's why Jesus gives instructions with regards to this. He says, I don't want you

222
00:35:27.909 --> 00:35:38.590
to worry, but he doesn't just tell us not to worry. He also tells us how we can stop worrying. And

223
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:46.780
so the passage that I wanted to read to you is actually found in Luke chapter 12. And let's go

224
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:53.250
through it together. It starts at verse 22. And it says that Jesus then said to his disciples.

225
00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:59.530
Therefore, I tell you do not worry about your life, what you're gonna eat or about your body. What

226
00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.100
you're gonna wear for life is more than food and the body is more than clothes. I want you to

227
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:10.989
consider the Ravens. They do not sew, they do not reap, they have no store room, they have no barn

228
00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:20.879
yet. God feeds them and how much more valuable you are than birds. Who of you by worrying can add a

229
00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:32.729
single hour to your own life or in another passage? It says, who can add even a cubic to their life?

230
00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:43.689
Meaning like being able to grow like 18 inches. And since you cannot do this very little thing, then

231
00:36:43.699 --> 00:36:50.649
why do you worry about the rest? And then in verse 27 it says, consider how the wild flowers grow.

232
00:36:50.659 --> 00:36:57.330
They do not labor, they do not spin yet. I tell you not even Solomon and all of his splendor was

233
00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:04.750
dressed like one of these fields. And if that is how God closes the grass of the field, which is

234
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:11.310
here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you you of little

235
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.540
faith and do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink and do not worry about it for the

236
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:23.510
pagan world runs after all such things. And your father knows that you need them but seek his

237
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:30.050
kingdom. And then these things will be given to you as well. Do not be afraid. Little flock for your

238
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:36.729
father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. I want you to even sell your possessions and give

239
00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:41.699
them to the poor, provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out a treasure in heaven. That

240
00:37:41.709 --> 00:37:48.949
will never fail where no thief comes near and no moth destroys for where your treasure is there,

241
00:37:49.070 --> 00:38:00.629
your heart will be also. Now, I'm not sure if we can put uh verse 32 to 34 on the same slide. I'm

242
00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:06.790
not sure if you can do that. But if you can't, then try anyways. And then if, if you can't, then

243
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:17.500
just split it between 32 33 then we'll put 34 by itself. So it starts at 32 it says, don't be afraid

244
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:26.139
little flock. And what the story here is is that Jesus looks at us and, and he says that we are his

245
00:38:26.149 --> 00:38:33.439
flock, that we're, he knows that we are prone to worry. He knows that we're prone to become anxious,

246
00:38:33.669 --> 00:38:40.500
but he's gonna take care of us. And then he makes it clear that he's our heavenly father and that

247
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:47.860
he's pleased to do something. And the thing that he's pleased to do is to give you the kingdom. And

248
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:54.719
now I want you to imagine that, that we look at ourselves and we worry about all these things. And

249
00:38:54.729 --> 00:39:02.090
Jesus is saying, but you have a father who has given you an inheritance and your inheritance is the

250
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:10.949
kingdom. You're worrying about things that you don't have to worry about. Because if you understood

251
00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:19.969
who I am, what I offer you and the inheritance that is at your access, access that is accessible to

252
00:39:19.979 --> 00:39:25.209
you, then you wouldn't worry the way that you do. Now, here's, here's my problem. My problem is I

253
00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:32.219
don't actually have a real trust fund anybody else. I wish I did. I wish I'd be able to just like,

254
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.729
you know, pursue my life, purpose and passions without ever having to worry about money again.

255
00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:43.719
Anybody else. I mean, I'm sure there's people in this room who play the lottery for that reason,

256
00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:52.479
just believing that, you know, that, that they could be the one who wins it next. Right. And, and,

257
00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:57.989
and you're hoping that that money is going to solve all of your problems. It's gonna bring all the

258
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.649
solutions that you can bring into your life. And so what we end up doing is we end up pursuing

259
00:40:03.659 --> 00:40:09.260
wealth because we don't understand how rich we already are.

260
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:20.449
We, we don't understand how wealthy God has already made us. And that if we would tap into that

261
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:27.979
through faith, we would stop worrying and we would stop being concerned about the things that we

262
00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:36.929
cannot control and put our trust in a God who has all of this under his control. And so then he

263
00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:46.489
challenges us to make room for God. And then in verse 33 he says something audacious. He says, why

264
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:53.419
don't you just sell your possessions and give to the poor? And he says, if you're so concerned about

265
00:40:53.429 --> 00:40:59.879
wealth, then then one way to no longer be concerned about it, no longer to have it, have mastery

266
00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:06.159
over you is to just sell it and get rid of it. And there was a rich ruler who was so wealthy that

267
00:41:06.229 --> 00:41:11.760
that when God saw how it was holding him back from understanding the kingdom. One of the things that

268
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:16.370
he told him to do was just sell everything and give it to the poor and then come and follow me. You

269
00:41:16.379 --> 00:41:22.340
see, sometimes wealth is the worst thing we can have because it keeps us away from the true riches

270
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:29.419
that God has to offer us what God wants is for us to make room through generosity, to make room in

271
00:41:29.429 --> 00:41:36.219
our hearts, to not be dominated by wealth. And not to have that as our God. And the only pursuit of

272
00:41:36.229 --> 00:41:45.570
our purpose in life so that we can actually see that God has a way of bringing wealth into our lives

273
00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:53.350
when we are able to be generous and no longer allow it to have mastery over us when we don't give

274
00:41:53.360 --> 00:42:01.340
because we feel we don't have. It is then that we truly can never have. That's what he's trying to

275
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:07.080
tell us. See, he's saying, I want to give you, I want to bless you. I want to give you more. But

276
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.090
here's the problem.

277
00:42:10.629 --> 00:42:20.560
Nothing can multiply if you hold on to it. See, there's a parable where one of the guys or girls in

278
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:28.250
the story takes this talent and buries it because they were afraid to lose it. And when, and when

279
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.550
the master of the house comes back, he says, where's the talent that I gave you? And he said, and

280
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:38.570
the person says, you know, I hit it in the ground because I was afraid to lose it. And so I'm happy

281
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:45.510
to be able to just give it back to you because you gave me one and I'm giving you back one and, and

282
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:51.340
they, and they, they felt really good about that, you know, because they didn't lose what they were

283
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:57.000
interested with. They held on to it. But here's the problem if you don't invest it. God can't

284
00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:07.189
multiply it. If you do nothing with it, then it can't serve anyone. See, when we hold on to what we

285
00:43:07.199 --> 00:43:12.300
think we're going to lose. Here's what happens when we worry about the little that we have. Here's

286
00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:15.770
what happens. We actually don't end up with anything more.

287
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:24.550
But when we invest it, the two becomes four and the five becomes 10 and the person who did nothing

288
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:30.000
with the one, well, that gets given to the person who turned the five into 10 because what God is

289
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:37.719
looking for is for people who know how to manage and steward and trust him in doing it. And God will

290
00:43:37.729 --> 00:43:43.550
always give more to the person who does more and is willing to invest more and is willing to trust

291
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.439
more. Does that make sense? And we do the same thing in our everyday relationships, right? It's like

292
00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:53.149
I want to trust you, but I can't trust you because, well, you keep proving to me that I can't, does

293
00:43:53.159 --> 00:43:57.879
that make sense? So I'm not going to trust you with more and I have enough to trust you with less

294
00:43:57.889 --> 00:44:04.669
and go give it to somebody who I can trust more with. If you're an employer, this makes sense.

295
00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:10.110
You're going to find that employee that you can entrust more. If, if you're in a relationship,

296
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:16.669
you're gonna find someone to be in a relationship with that, you can entrust more. If you have a

297
00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:21.860
family member that you trusted and then they break that trust and you're going to go outside of even

298
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:30.050
your family unit to find someone that you can trust more. And we do this all the time. And then when

299
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.679
we look at God and we say, God, why aren't you blessing my life? God says, well, why are you always

300
00:44:35.689 --> 00:44:37.090
worrying about your life?

301
00:44:40.129 --> 00:44:46.419
Don't you think I want to give you more? That's my whole purpose in life is to give you my kingdom.

302
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:56.260
Your inheritance is already there. You're not tapping into what I have for you. You think I don't

303
00:44:56.270 --> 00:45:04.820
want to give you more. My whole purpose is to make sure you have more so that you can not only do

304
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:15.100
more but be more. That's what I wanna do. And so in Matthew in chapter six and in verse 34 this is

305
00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:27.120
the same story told a little differently in this book and it ends differently and it says, I don't

306
00:45:27.129 --> 00:45:35.169
want you to worry about tomorrow because tomorrow will worry about its own things sufficient for the

307
00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:39.169
day is its own trouble. You cannot,

308
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.929
you cannot serve God and riches at the same time. That's what it's saying.

309
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.879
You can't serve God and riches at the same time

310
00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.979
because if you get concerned about one, you're not gonna lose sight of the other. So God says, why

311
00:46:01.989 --> 00:46:10.889
don't you just trust me for both of those things, trust me for today. Trust me for tomorrow, trust

312
00:46:10.899 --> 00:46:21.949
me with what you have and with what I have yet not given you and know that I will. And so in Matthew

313
00:46:21.959 --> 00:46:30.810
six and then in verse 24 he goes on to expand, expand on this. And he says, even before you, you

314
00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.840
read into this whole part where Jesus is saying, I don't want you to worry about tomorrow. This is

315
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:41.050
what he says. He says you cannot serve two masters because either you're going to hate the one and

316
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:46.830
you're going to love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot

317
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:55.020
serve God and money. And so what he's telling us in this passage is, is essentially that you can't

318
00:46:55.030 --> 00:47:03.370
serve God and riches at the same time. But our natural instinct when we worry is to default to fear

319
00:47:03.379 --> 00:47:08.250
instead of faith. And so what Jesus does is he has to address that because He knows that this is

320
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:14.239
what we're going to worry about. And so Jesus actually comprises his own list. And in the passages

321
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:18.419
that we just read, I'm gonna break it down for you, for you. And I'm going to put it up here on the

322
00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:24.250
screen that there are five things that we tend to worry about. And Jesus addresses each of these

323
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:32.810
things. He says that we worry about our finances, that we worry about our food. We worry about our

324
00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:38.989
fitness, which is our health we worry about clothing and what we wear and that's fashion, but we

325
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.250
also worry about our future. Now, when you see a list like this, you're going to see that you're

326
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:52.340
going to worry about some things more than others. And some of us should really start to worry about

327
00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.320
some things more than others.

328
00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:04.310
It's going to speak to, to both of us in this category a little differently. Maybe we don't worry

329
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.459
enough about those things and maybe we should do something about them. So God says, I want you to

330
00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:16.879
move away from a place of worry and instead into a place of and here's the key word concern.

331
00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:27.350
And so if we can transition away from worry, then we can eliminate anxiety because if we can become

332
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.719
concerned about these things, then what this does is that it moves us away from inaction towards

333
00:48:32.729 --> 00:48:41.590
action. And so the reason that Jesus addresses these things is because we look at this list and we

334
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:50.209
may see that we have action and inaction in these categories that are up on the screen. And God is

335
00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:57.850
saying which one is there action, in which one is their inaction in and in the areas where there's

336
00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:03.850
inaction, chances are we are worrying about those things but not necessarily doing anything about

337
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:04.189
them.

338
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:18.570
And that's why in Luke chapter 21 in verse 34 to 36 look how Jesus describes this. He says that this

339
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:24.830
is what's gonna happen to us if we're not careful. So he starts with the warning. Watch out. Now

340
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.699
when Jesus says, watch out, well, then what should we do? Watch out?

341
00:49:32.229 --> 00:49:40.149
Right. He doesn't say it often. But when he says watch out, then we should really watch out like we

342
00:49:40.159 --> 00:49:45.409
should really pay attention to what it is that he's about to tell us. And so what he's telling us is

343
00:49:45.419 --> 00:49:53.389
he says, don't let your heart look at this be dulled by carousing and drunkenness. And then adds,

344
00:49:54.239 --> 00:50:05.780
and by the worries of this life, don't let that day catch you unaware like a trap because for that

345
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:13.719
day will come upon everyone living on the earth, keep alert at all times and pray that you might be

346
00:50:13.729 --> 00:50:21.629
strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the son of man. And so he brings our

347
00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:29.810
attention to two things. The first thing he says is watch out for the worries of this life and then

348
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.649
watch out for the pleasures that it offers.

349
00:50:36.699 --> 00:50:44.060
And the thing that we sometimes don't realize is that worry leads us to a place where we just want

350
00:50:46.139 --> 00:50:46.989
to forget.

351
00:50:52.229 --> 00:50:57.739
And without realizing it, we're going to turn to the things that give us pleasure because the life

352
00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:05.830
that we're leading isn't accomplishing that. And instead of things getting better, they actually get

353
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.330
worse, but in a different way.

354
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.879
And so he says, you need to watch out because without realizing the things that you are worrying

355
00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:24.989
about are legitimate. But instead of handling it in the right way, you turn to the things that

356
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.810
actually help you deal with it, but bring about devastating effects both in you and those around.

357
00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:30.989
You

358
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:40.580
see, whenever God brings something into our life, it's not only going to make our life better, but

359
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:48.580
it's gonna make the lives of those around us better as well. That's how it works. If it blesses us

360
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.179
and destroys others, it isn't from God,

361
00:51:55.209 --> 00:52:00.800
it isn't good for us and it certainly isn't good for others. You see, it can never just be a

362
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:08.530
blessing to us and a curse to others. When something blesses it blesses everyone and everything.

363
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.250
That's how God operates. That's what blessing means. It's not just a blessing to me, but it's a

364
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:23.770
blessing now through me as well, it's a blessing to you and through you. And when we understand this,

365
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:32.010
then we understand that Jesus doesn't just tell us not to worry, but he shows us how not to worry

366
00:52:32.239 --> 00:52:42.030
because worry does this. It focuses on what's beyond our control and this will always result in

367
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:52.040
inaction. It will always do the same thing. And so if it paralyzes you, if it forces you to not make

368
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:58.110
a move, if it feels like if you make a move, it's going to be the wrong one. And so therefore you do

369
00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:06.020
nothing, then you know that you are worrying about this and it's in your hands, under your control

370
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:14.899
and not in God's hands and under his control. But what concern does is that it shifts the focus on

371
00:53:14.909 --> 00:53:23.879
what's within our control and puts it back into God's control because concern then points us back to

372
00:53:23.889 --> 00:53:31.139
who is most concerned about this and it's already our heavenly Father. See, I'm not the only one

373
00:53:31.149 --> 00:53:36.669
who's concerned about these things. I go back to the fact that God is already concerned about these

374
00:53:36.679 --> 00:53:45.570
things. And so what I do is that I say, God, I know you're concerned about these things. In fact, in

375
00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:53.889
your word, you say not to worry that you've got this, that you're able to give me your kingdom. You

376
00:53:53.899 --> 00:54:00.469
have given me an inheritance that I don't need to worry because you've got this under your control.

377
00:54:00.479 --> 00:54:07.800
And so these are not my words, they're yours. So bring them to pass in my life. Say I take God's

378
00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:13.570
word and I bring it back to him and I say I'm going to put my faith and trust in what you have said.

379
00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:19.810
I'm gonna start believing what you have already declared. So I'm gonna stop worrying about it

380
00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:27.760
because I know that I can be concerned to a point but know that it's not going to leave me in a

381
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:35.060
place of inaction, but action by putting my faith and trust in you. I like the fact that he mentions

382
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:46.080
birds in the story. I'm not a bird watcher. Although one of my favorite movies is, um, the big year.

383
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:52.739
Has anyone ever seen this with Jack Black? And it's a, it's a story of, of, um, I don't know why

384
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:56.750
it's important. I don't even know if I should tell you this. I don't even know if it matters.

385
00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:01.290
Probably doesn't anyways. Just look it up for yourselves. It's a, it's a funny movie. It's a good

386
00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:05.729
movie. It's about birds, It's about bird watching. It's about the honor system of finding as many

387
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:11.010
birds as you can in one year. And it's just having the, the, the, the ability to go around the world

388
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:16.949
saying that you are the best bird watcher in the world, aren't you? Aren't you fascinated by this

389
00:55:16.959 --> 00:55:26.909
movie? Now? Anyways, I'm such an idiot. Sorry about that. See, this is why don't deviate. You can,

390
00:55:26.919 --> 00:55:33.330
you know, this is what happens. But, but, but Jesus is talking about birds when he's talking about

391
00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:40.870
birds. This is what he's talking about. He says birds are not waiting for the food to be brought to

392
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:41.270
them.

393
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:52.100
And, and, and I, I had to think about that for a second because I realized that birds are also not

394
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:53.179
awake at night.

395
00:55:55.300 --> 00:56:00.229
You are never going to find a bird that is awake at night. Ok. Maybe there's a species of birds that

396
00:56:00.239 --> 00:56:07.939
I'm not aware of that. Maybe it's nocturnal. I get it. Let me just finish my point. Can always find

397
00:56:07.949 --> 00:56:14.649
a flaw in what I'm saying? Let me just finish. Birds are not awake at night, rubbing their little

398
00:56:14.659 --> 00:56:23.889
wings together, anxious and chirping all night wondering what are they going to eat when the sun

399
00:56:23.899 --> 00:56:31.360
comes up? Does that make sense? They're not doing that? They're sleeping unlike us who are awake?

400
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:40.270
And so what Jesus is saying is that birds are different because they understand that there will

401
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:48.510
always be food for them in the morning. Man. I want to go to bed every night believing that Jesus

402
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:56.260
has got my back that there is nothing I need to worry about because he's got it covered if he's

403
00:56:56.270 --> 00:57:02.010
going to take care of the fields and the birds and if their splendor is going to be even greater

404
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:11.530
than any of the clothes that Solomon could wear as the richest zillionaire in the world, then what

405
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:18.040
do I got to worry about the finances that maybe aren't coming in the way that I would expect him to

406
00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:25.719
Jesus saying, hey, what you worry about most reveals where you trust me the least.

407
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:33.030
And I, I, I need to go to the things that I'm worrying about and I need to say God, this is where

408
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:40.360
I'm trusting you the least. And maybe it isn't in one of those five categories, but probably is. But

409
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:45.030
it's gonna speak to me where I'm not trusting you or I'm not putting my faith in you where I'm not

410
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:51.189
believing that you can do things in my life where you can turn things around for me because what you

411
00:57:51.199 --> 00:57:57.010
worry most about reveals where your heart is. That's where your treasure is. That's what Jesus was

412
00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:03.129
saying. When he said that when we're worrying, we're basically saying, God, I don't really trust you

413
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:08.790
when we're worrying. We're saying God, I don't trust your plan when we're worrying. We're saying God,

414
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:14.719
I don't believe that you're with me when we're worrying, we're saying God, I'm not sure that you are

415
00:58:14.729 --> 00:58:27.050
really truly good. But when we move away from worry and we move instead to a place of trust that we

416
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:34.540
can put our faith and trust in a verse just like this in John 14 and verse 27. He says, I'm leaving

417
00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:42.429
you with a gift. He says, I'm gonna give you peace of mind and heart. And the peace that I give you

418
00:58:42.439 --> 00:58:51.090
is a gift that the world cannot give. So don't be troubled, don't worry, don't be afraid, don't be

419
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:56.639
anxious because He is our peace. Amen. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

420
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:08.179
And we've got an awesome opportunity to just come before God right now. And just to say God, you

421
00:59:08.189 --> 00:59:14.870
know where it is that we are anxious where we are worrying where it is that we find ourselves, you

422
00:59:14.879 --> 00:59:21.280
know, with too much inaction and not enough trust in you, not believing your word and your promises

423
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:26.340
for our lives. And, and I, I want you to just go to that place right now in your mind and your heart

424
00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:30.820
and I want you to just go to God. And I want to say God, I'm gonna trust you in this area of my life.

425
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:36.409
Like never before, I'm gonna trust you for my finances and for the right relationship. I'm gonna

426
00:59:36.419 --> 00:59:41.500
trust you for my health and I'm gonna trust you for my, for my food and I'm gonna trust you for my

427
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:49.100
from for every area of my life that I'm just not believing that you can turn things around it. I I

428
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:55.489
Lord, I want you to just give us that, that, that faith that can also be a spiritual gift to each of

429
00:59:55.500 --> 01:00:02.989
us just to move forward like never before. So we can leave our worry behind and on our anxiety that

430
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.389
paralyzes us forever in the past and move forward instead no longer with fear, but with faith,

431
01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:19.709
believing in your multiplying powers to take what we have and to do great things with it, not just

432
01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:26.070
for us, but for those that you are calling us to bless with it. And Lord, I pray that you would

433
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:32.260
change our minds and our hearts today that you would do what you just said here in this verse that

434
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:40.770
you would give us peace of mind and of heart. I pray lord that where it is that we are struggling

435
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.250
where it is that we are revealing that we don't trust you enough that Lord, that would be the area

436
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:53.020
that you would start with each of us. And as we commit this to you, lord, we pray for the victory in

437
01:00:53.030 --> 01:01:00.070
Jesus name, we pray for a breakthrough in Jesus name. We pray for our lives to be once and for all

438
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.790
transformed in Jesus name. Let me pray this in the name of the Father and of the Son of the Holy

439
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:14.290
Spirit, One God. Amen. Amen. I pray God blesses you and encourages you and helps you.

440
01:01:17.409 --> 01:01:24.120
And we're gonna do something that we don't do often. Here. We're gonna, we're actually gonna sing a

441
01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:31.110
hymn. I know you're shocked and you may not even know what a hymn is. But if you grew up like in a

442
01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.100
really old traditional church, then, then you know what a hymn is and, and this is it, this is a

443
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:42.739
hymn that it's gonna speak to us about trust. It's about trusting in the Lord. You ready to sing it

444
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:48.370
together. Well, I'm gonna ask you that you stand with me as you do that and that we would sing these

445
01:01:48.379 --> 01:01:55.649
words. And I want you to realize that as we're singing these words, we're, we're singing the

446
01:01:55.659 --> 01:02:04.120
scriptures, we're singing the truth that God has given to us through his word and that today our

447
01:02:04.129 --> 01:02:08.600
lives will be changed and transformed through it. All right, let's sing this song together. God

448
01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:18.489
bless you guys. Yeah, guys are just as we're singing, you know, hymns are so simple. They're so

449
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:24.790
simple and they don't have a ton of fluff and all, sometimes the fluff is great. But the simplicity

450
01:02:24.969 --> 01:02:31.909
of these words just can really cut straight to your heart. So I just encourage you as you're singing.

451
01:02:31.919 --> 01:02:39.969
Just really, really, um think about those places where you are starting to trust God and just let

452
01:02:39.979 --> 01:02:46.959
the simplicity of what you're singing be enough. Let it be enough to just give it to the Lord and

453
01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:53.540
just put it in his hands. So let's just, let's sing this together. That's a beautiful song
