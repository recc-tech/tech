00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:49.130
Hey, how's everyone doing? You guys are good. Can't believe it's the last week in August. Does that

2
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:55.280
make you just a little sad? Just a little. Well, we're about to restore some joy into your lives

3
00:09:55.289 --> 00:10:01.000
with this gathering. So why don't you guys just stand as we would open this up before God and open

4
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:06.270
up our minds and hearts before him as well. And as we find ourselves in his presence, whatever it is

5
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.559
that is on your mind, whatever is on your heart, whatever it is that you've been going through,

6
00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:15.119
whatever it is that's been troubling you, whatever it is that you have been also celebrating. This

7
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:22.469
is a moment for us to just be able to turn with gratitude towards a God who really sees us, hears us

8
00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:27.580
and is concerned about us. And today we're going to hear more about that as we look at the message

9
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.059
called the Journey of Transformation. It's gonna be the last message in our series getting there.

10
00:10:32.369 --> 00:10:39.469
And then we are going to hear some announcements and have a time of worship with our band right

11
00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:45.880
behind me. And we just want to encourage all the kids to go to kids church right now. It's at 10:30

12
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:52.419
a.m. and uh, youth meets every Sunday at 10 a.m. And so if, if you have any youth or are a youth

13
00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:58.909
person yourself, then you can join them every Sunday at 10 o'clock in the annex. Well, why don't we

14
00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:03.190
just open in a word of prayer? Father? I wanna thank you for every person that is here today for the

15
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.719
way that your hand of favor is already upon them for the way that you have brought them into a

16
00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:15.229
relationship with you for how you love them and care for them and for the way that you are going to

17
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:21.320
reveal yourself even more powerfully to them. Thank you for those that are watching online and for

18
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:28.020
those that are here in person. Lord, you have something for all of us and a something uniquely

19
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:36.270
designed for each of us. And today is a day in which we will be grateful to you even in anticipation

20
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:42.510
of the great things that are going to happen. We wanna believe in that. We wanna have faith for that.

21
00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:48.250
And today is a day in which we can also rejoice in that. And we pray these things in jesus' name.

22
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:55.729
Amen. Let's worship together. We're gonna sing a song called the one which is talking about our

23
00:11:55.739 --> 00:12:03.330
heavenly Father and that how he is the one for us. He knows us. He knows every uh hair on our head.

24
00:12:03.859 --> 00:12:09.770
And we just want to sing these words back to him and thank him for being the one in our lives.

80
00:27:55.609 --> 00:28:02.969
Thanks for your team. That was beautiful, wasn't it? Everything's all right. Good to see you guys.

81
00:28:02.979 --> 00:28:06.859
So glad you're with us. And uh we're just gonna share some quick announcements before we continue

82
00:28:06.869 --> 00:28:11.770
with our gathering today. We're gonna continue with our series and end it today called Getting There.

83
00:28:12.069 --> 00:28:17.229
And, uh, if you wanted to catch up on previous messages in this series, if you are in a transition

84
00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:22.369
in your life and, and these messages have been speaking to you about what God can do in the moments

85
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.920
of transitions, then you can just check out our website and you'll see that all the messages and the

87
00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:40.290
as well. Well, I wanted to just give a round of applause to our, uh women's leader, Patricia Godley

88
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.599
as well as her team for putting on such an incredible event for the ladies yesterday. Um What a,

89
00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:53.300

Unlikely Royalty Series and they taught on rehab and uh the booklets, the food, just, uh the

91
00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:06.000

94
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:28.010

95
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:35.260
time with the barbecue and a time of, of worship and hearing the speaker, uh Sean Van and uh so

96
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:43.260
appreciate uh the work that uh Paul uh Hana did in putting that event on. And uh man, next time, if

97
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:48.119
you get an opportunity, join us in the next event, it's gonna be happening soon. That was a great

98
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:53.819
one to, to be a part of. And uh if you guys want to see like uh pictures and videos and things like

99
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:57.819
that and you just have to follow us on the socials and you'll be able to catch up on all that stuff

100
00:29:57.829 --> 00:30:03.119
as well. And, uh, we just want to make an announcement with regards to our cafe team. Uh, we are

101
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.869
going to be ramping up uh for the fall. And so we need some new volunteers that can step in and just

102
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.040
help out. And if you can help out once a month or once every couple of months, then we'd love for

103
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.709
you to be part of the cafe team. There's a sign up sheet there and Richard's gonna just give you

104
00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:24.199
guys some information as you approach him at the cafe and there's a sign up sheet there, you can

105
00:30:24.209 --> 00:30:29.000
just put your name down and, uh, he'll tell you exactly what it takes to be a part of the team and

106
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:35.280
what kind of acts of service you'll be doing when you're on for the schedule. And, uh, we just

107
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:41.349
appreciate our cafe team. Uh, they've taken a break during the summer, we've had other people fill

108
00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:47.270
in and just provide some cold drinks. But that will come back on the second week of September. So

109
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.540
our cafe team is gonna be uh there on the second week of September, something else that we're

110
00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:57.380
launching and something that we've been working towards as we've been just relaunching our

111
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:03.530
ministries and our programs and getting volunteers is our prayer team. And so our prayer team is

112
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.520
going to be made available at the end of every gathering. And so if anyone just feels like they need

113
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:16.739
something to have someone else just pray for them and with them and over them, then at the end of

114
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:22.890
every gathering, we're gonna have a prayer team and that is launching on September the 10th. So in a

115
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:29.030
couple of weeks time, we're going to be having our prayer team back at River's edge. And uh can we

116
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.250
just give it up for our prayer team and those who have signed up for that

117
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:42.479
and also for uh Randall who's going to be leading that ministry, we pray his blessings on his life

118
00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:49.040
and uh and how he's just selected those people and, and now that those people who have agreed. And

119
00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.479
so we just pray that God would also send him more people so that we could have a great rotation

120
00:31:53.489 --> 00:31:59.540
there as well. And so the next thing that we're gonna be launching and, and working towards is our

121
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:04.640
connection team. And so if you'd like to be a part of that, just welcoming people connecting with

122
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:10.099
people that come on a week to week basis, as well as seeing the new people that are coming here

123
00:32:10.109 --> 00:32:16.170
every week. Um This church has hundreds of people that come to it. And as you know, you're not

124
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:22.579
always be able to be here every Sunday, but when you are here, it's important that people see you uh

125
00:32:22.589 --> 00:32:26.839
that they connect with you, that they help you with your next steps. And so that's what the

126
00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:30.880
connection team is going to do. And so we're gonna make some announcements in the weeks to come

127
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:36.719
about the connection team and about being a part of that team and uh is gonna be leading that team

128
00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:43.219
for us. And uh she's also gonna be uh presented to you at some point. So we'll just pray for all

129
00:32:43.229 --> 00:32:47.849
these things, all these ministries, all these activities, all the things that we have going on. And

130
00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:53.920
uh we just also want to give our condolences to, to Rosa for the passing away of your aunt last week.

131
00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:58.150
And we're just gonna take a moment to just pray for Rosa and her family father. I want to thank you

132
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:04.250
for Rosa for her life, for the passing of her aunt. We just pray that you comfort them and we thank

133
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:11.099
you that you have received Joanne into your presence. We are glad that today uh her suffering has

134
00:33:11.109 --> 00:33:17.209
ended, but we know it's so hard to lose someone that we love. And I just pray that you continue to

135
00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:23.900
be a comfort to Rosa and her family and to Joanne and his family as well. And we pray these things

136
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:31.520
in jesus' name. Amen. So if there's a way that you can contribute financially, we would love to take

137
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:37.270
that gift and put it into our ministries and activities for the way that we also tie back into our

138
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:44.020
community, but also tithe into organizations that are doing amazing work around the world. And so

139
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.550
that's what we do with the funds that you provide and we just want to thank you for your

140
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.119
faithfulness. Um We have two great apps that you can use with the Tide app as well as the Canada

141
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:58.099
helps app. You can also give in person at the P Os machines, but you can also send E transfers and

142
00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:04.109
then we get to keep 100% of that donation. And if you'd like a receipt, all you need to do is when

143
00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:08.389
you use the apps, you automatically get one, when you give through E transfers, it's automatically

144
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:13.600
recorded. But if you ever use the P OS machines, you need to use the envelopes, put down your name,

145
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:19.550
put the amount down and submit that. And then you will get a tax receipt at the end of the year and

146
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:26.040
then for your taxes, you can get up to 50% back of that donation that you have made. And so thank

147
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:31.148
you for, for that. So let's continue with the gathering. Let's watch this video when we get into the

148
00:34:31.158 --> 00:34:33.128
message called the Journey of Transformation.

149
00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:26.320
Well, if you've never felt completely yourself, you know that you're not always at your best when

150
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:32.149
that happens and when you sometimes are not at your best, that's when the people that you care about

151
00:35:32.159 --> 00:35:39.070
the most and maybe uh just want to impress the most see you at your worst. And when they make those

152
00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:45.379
determinations about you in the moment, they, they can really hurt and they can last and especially

153
00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:50.370
if they take that moment and then just share it with someone else, they can really devastate you. Uh

154
00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:56.739
It's a moment of vulnerability, uh a moment in which you weren't maybe at your best self. And yet

155
00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:03.639
that moment has now been just shared with someone else and you've lost your, your privacy. Um

156
00:36:03.649 --> 00:36:12.719
Something that you so so want to guard, you feel exposed. And when you experience that you

157
00:36:12.729 --> 00:36:19.060
experience a level of pain that can sometimes just kind of linger with, you can stay with you. And

158
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:24.939
it's not just because you're worried about how that person will continue to see you. But it's also

159
00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:31.330
about the way that you now see yourself and sometimes the person that is the hardest on you is is

160
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:38.709
you. And when we live with those moments, we can sometimes just always have a reason to, to not feel

161
00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:45.409
good about ourselves and, and our journey, uh about the transition that we're in the, the direction

162
00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:50.949
that we're headed, the things that we've lived and the things that we're living and we sometimes

163
00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:57.699
look to the future with uh a bleakness like we, we don't have a lot of hope and we don't think that

164
00:36:57.709 --> 00:37:02.520
things are going to be much different if you've ever struggled with any of these things. And you

165
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:11.239
understand what it's like to, to be even in a spiritual journey with God where God doesn't always um

166
00:37:12.439 --> 00:37:19.620
seemingly answer your prayers. And, and I say, seemingly because, because I know that because of

167
00:37:19.629 --> 00:37:30.260
Jesus, he hears your every prayer because of Jesus, every time you speak to God, God hears what you

168
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:38.159
say because Jesus makes sure that it's hurt. I, I say seemingly because every moment that you're

169
00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:44.540
going through that you think that God is absent from your life. It's impossible because Jesus is

170
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:54.750
always present. He's made that promise. The problem isn't with any of that. The problem is be

171
00:37:54.760 --> 00:38:03.370
believing it. You see the thing about belief and faith is that when, when something is proven, you

172
00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:04.000
believe it

173
00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:13.530
a and, and until it's proven it's hard to believe it. The thing about faith is is that I'm asked to

174
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.709
believe it even when it hasn't happened yet.

175
00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:28.250
And, and so we sometimes use faith and belief interchangeably. We, we use one to replace the other.

176
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:35.780
But they're two different things altogether. I, I believe because God has come through, he has

177
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:44.500
proven himself to be true and alive and a fulfill of his promises. But I also have faith in the

178
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:51.949
areas of my life where this has yet to come to pass. And I believe that when you make this

179
00:38:51.959 --> 00:38:59.110
distinction, we now have a clarity and our understanding that my problem here isn't one of belief.

180
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:05.969
It's one of faith. And when I'm in the transitions of my life, often, I, I'm in a wilderness

181
00:39:05.979 --> 00:39:15.830
experience where I'm, I'm talking about a dryness. I'm talking about a lack. I, I'm talking about

182
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:24.239
feeling like I'm on the verge of death where what I need to sustain myself and to propel myself

183
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:31.919
forward, feels like it's just not there and it's always missing and it may never come. And so when

184
00:39:31.929 --> 00:39:37.780
we're in the transitions of our life, we sometimes just feel bad about ourselves because we look at

185
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:43.679
ourselves and we say, I don't, I don't believe. Well, it's because it, it hasn't come to pass yet.

186
00:39:43.689 --> 00:39:50.399
But is there something that has come to pass? Is there something that you can anchor yourself too?

187
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:56.600
You see the problem with the Israelites in their transition out of Egypt and into can is that they

188
00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:05.199
kept forgetting what God had done. They had already seen things that should have anchored their

189
00:40:05.209 --> 00:40:12.530
belief, but it didn't seem to, to make a difference because when the next crisis took place, they,

190
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:19.080
they were back to complaining and they were back to being negative. I don't know if you're a person

191
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:25.030
who tends to be more optimistic or pessimistic, a person who tends to be more hopeful or someone

192
00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:31.250
who's devastated more by the circumstances of your life. And I know that sometimes it's a

193
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.330
personality thing. Sometimes it's been an upbringing type of thing. Sometimes we've, we've had so

194
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:42.889
much anxiety in our household, we don't know how to break free from that because it's just been

195
00:40:42.979 --> 00:40:50.810
constant in our minds and in our lives. And we've seen people around us always stressing that. Then

196
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:57.120
we become like that and, and then we come to faith and then we, we carry these things into our

197
00:40:57.129 --> 00:41:04.169
relationship with God and, and every time something happens, we, we, we tend to, to not act with

198
00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:13.689
faith. We, we tend to act out of fear. We, we tend to respond out of fear instead of responding with

199
00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:21.959
faith because our belief isn't strong enough and it isn't anchored in the things that God has

200
00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:29.909
already shown us. And you would say, well, that's not true. I, but I'm, I'm gonna argue with you on

201
00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:31.540
that. Uh It is true

202
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:40.500
because with everyone in this room, God has performed a miracle already in your life

203
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.959
and that brought you to a place where you believe.

204
00:41:50.439 --> 00:41:56.770
And so whenever you're faced with a crisis and, and you're in a wilderness and a transition in your

205
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:02.010
life. You have to say God in the same way that you were faithful

206
00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:10.760
and the lives of those that I never met that are in your scriptures and in the same way that you

207
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:19.760
were faithful in my life. In this instant, I will continue to put my faith in you because you will

208
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:27.270
get me out of this desert. You will get me out of this wilderness. You will fill me with wonder and

209
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:34.580
awe. I will stop fearing my weakness and I will start worshiping your strength.

210
00:42:37.189 --> 00:42:44.780
See, we need to make that kind of transition. So it's gotta be our journey of transformation that

211
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:55.100
happens because we're no longer just limiting ourselves to the strength of our faith. But we are

212
00:42:55.110 --> 00:43:03.689
anchoring it to our belief. And, and the people of Israel used to be able to say and needs to be

213
00:43:03.699 --> 00:43:12.620
able to pray. And to this day they continue to do it. And they say in the same way that you were

214
00:43:12.629 --> 00:43:23.739
with our father Abraham and you were with Jacob and Isaac. I know that you are with me.

215
00:43:26.219 --> 00:43:36.090
And so in numbers, in chapter 11, there's a moment even in moses' life where he's struggling with

216
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:44.729
this, like he, he doesn't know if he has the belief, let alone the faith to see God do what needs to

217
00:43:44.739 --> 00:43:55.459
be done. And so in numbers 11 and in verse 23 it says, then the Lord said to Moses has my arm lost

218
00:43:55.469 --> 00:44:04.310
power. Now, every time I get fearful and in my transitions, I'm facing a crisis and I look at my

219
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:09.979
circumstances and they're much larger than my resources whenever I look at the circumstances of my

220
00:44:09.989 --> 00:44:17.280
life and I feel like they're overwhelming me instead of me having mastery over them. I remember this

221
00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:23.850
story where Moses himself went through a crisis of faith and, and, and then he questioned God and

222
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:30.229
his ability and being able to provide for them in the desert. And God had to respond to Moses and

223
00:44:30.239 --> 00:44:38.540
say, has my arm lost its power. Now, you will see whether or not my word comes true. And I think

224
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:44.219
back to this moment, and I say God in the same way that Moses questioned you, I questioned too in

225
00:44:44.229 --> 00:44:50.100
this moment in the same way that He lost his footing and, and very much lost his faith that you

226
00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:56.790
could come through. I'm in the same place. But in the same way that you proved Moses wrong, prove me

227
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.699
wrong today,

228
00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:09.899
show me how wrong I am because I want to believe today that your arm has not lost its power that

229
00:45:09.909 --> 00:45:16.820
there is nowhere that you cannot reach. There is nothing that you cannot do. There is absolutely no

230
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:24.739
one and nothing that you cannot overcome. You can provide in every season of my life, including this

231
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:38.590
one. You see, that's where I take my faith. And I turn it into belief. I transition it and I make

232
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:47.820
sure that in the transition of my life, I reframe what's going on. I don't let that control me. I

233
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:57.860
let it bring confidence to me. You see, God doesn't want us to be controlled by things. He wants us

234
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.620
to gain confidence from them.

235
00:46:01.629 --> 00:46:08.699
And the only way that you can gain confidence is in the wilderness. It's in the transitions. It's

236
00:46:08.709 --> 00:46:15.419
going from one place to the next, from where you are to where you need to go. It is the only way

237
00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:24.639
that he can build you up and help you to remind yourself of what you have belief in, but also in how

238
00:46:24.649 --> 00:46:31.070
your faith can be strengthened. And so sometimes in the transitions of our life, it just feels like

239
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:38.060
we're just wandering and I've been lost before I, I probably get lost at least once a day, anybody

240
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:44.550
else. And just me, it, it happens. I think a lot of us got lost going up to the, to the men's

241
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:51.860
retreat. And, uh, you know, we were supposed to end up at a, uh at a, at a, at a guy's house and we

242
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:59.899
ended up at a cemetery. Uh We went to experience life and we were faced with uh imminent death

243
00:46:59.909 --> 00:47:08.080
instead. Uh It was just a weird thing. We weren't that far, you know, from where we were gonna

244
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:14.989
experience life, but the cemetery is actually right next to this guy's house. And so when you ended

245
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.199
up at the cemetery, you knew you were in the wrong place. And so you felt like maybe who knows,

246
00:47:19.209 --> 00:47:26.760
everything else was wrong too. And it just reminded me how, how close you could be to life when

247
00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:34.429
you're living an experience of death. And they were side by side, I mean, literally divided by just

248
00:47:34.439 --> 00:47:41.639
some, some hedges and some trees and a property line that wasn't really visible from the road. But,

249
00:47:41.649 --> 00:47:47.520
but here were tombstones declaring death and, and, and right next to it, there was a campfire that

250
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.510
was declaring life and food and sustenance and everything else that we would need.

251
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.590
And I think about how that we're often wandering and, and God is saying, I don't want this

252
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:07.330
transition in your life to be wasted and we waste the transitions, we waste them all the time

253
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:12.439
because we just want to get out of the transitions. I don't know about you. I don't wanna waste time

254
00:48:12.449 --> 00:48:17.899
in between. I just want to get to where I need to get to. I want God to just do it. I want to

255
00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:23.280
experience the promise. I don't want to go through the pain. Why do I have to go through the pain to

256
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:29.209
experience the promise? I'll tell you why because my belief isn't anchored and because my faith is

257
00:48:29.219 --> 00:48:30.350
still not strong enough.

258
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:39.389
And the only way that God is going to help me in those two areas of my life is in the transitions.

259
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:48.219
So I cannot curse the transition. I need to see that the transition is part of my life.

260
00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:59.830
And every time we curse the transition, we are wasting our wandering. And God is saying transitions

261
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:06.959
are meant instead to be opportunities for you to welcome worshiping.

262
00:49:09.239 --> 00:49:14.810
I don't know about you, but in the moments in which I'm lost, those are the moments where I'm the

263
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:22.729
most frustrated when I'm lost and I can't find my way and I've just missed my turn on the GPS or, or

264
00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:28.570
I feel like the GPS has let me down. How many have you been let down by your GPS? I, I've been let

265
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:35.489
down more times by my GPS than, than I feel like I've God has let me down. That's the truth. And,

266
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:41.739
and, and so when I miss a turn and I find myself wondering, I don't know about you, but my automatic

267
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:50.139
response is not to just start worshiping that right? I'm not going to tell you what actually happens

268
00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:58.379
because that's way too vulnerable. Um And private and you guys are maybe coming in a little judgy

269
00:49:58.389 --> 00:50:05.260
today so I, I can't trust you with that. Um But the truth of the matter is is that sometimes like, I

270
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:11.070
don't have my best moments when I'm wondering and, and maybe you don't either. Maybe the truth is

271
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.020
that when you're wandering, that's when you're the most frustrated or the most angry that's when you

272
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:24.949
are the most likely instead of spewing blessings, you're spewing curses in those moments, instead of

273
00:50:24.959 --> 00:50:33.300
worshiping, you are someone who is most likely spewing wickedness.

274
00:50:35.959 --> 00:50:45.629
And so I bring this up because the transition that needs to happen in my life is this Lord. When I

275
00:50:45.639 --> 00:50:53.409
find myself in the wilderness and I'm wandering, would you make me a worshiper

276
00:50:56.419 --> 00:51:06.479
in spirit and in truth because you know, the devil comes in the wilderness. We saw it with Jesus and

277
00:51:06.489 --> 00:51:11.449
that's when you're going to be your most vulnerable and, and then, and Satan is gonna come and he's

278
00:51:11.459 --> 00:51:18.219
gonna try to tempt you and give you a way out of the wilderness and give you a way to transition.

279
00:51:18.469 --> 00:51:21.780
And I want you to just tell you that when we are in our wilderness,

280
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.870
that is when we are going to get the worst advice.

281
00:51:29.399 --> 00:51:34.090
That's when the worst options of getting out of the wilderness are going to come

282
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:45.370
when we are in the wilderness. That is exactly where because of our wandering and our weakness.

283
00:51:45.379 --> 00:51:51.169
Satan is going to come and he's going to present a plan that's gonna make things worse

284
00:51:53.530 --> 00:52:00.760
and you need to be aware of that. And that is why when we see Jesus responding in the wilderness,

285
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:05.449
he was responding with worship,

286
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:18.370
he worshiped the word, he worshiped the faithfulness of his father, he worshiped his plan and his

287
00:52:18.379 --> 00:52:27.689
promise and he was convinced that there was nothing that Satan could offer him. That was better than

288
00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:29.540
what God had already declared over him.

289
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:39.790
You see, in the moments in which I am wondering, I have to be aware of my weakness,

290
00:52:42.419 --> 00:52:50.939
but Jesus is present when we worship and if he had victory over Satan in that moment, it's because

291
00:52:50.949 --> 00:52:58.889
he wants to give us that same victory in our own wilderness. You believe that for yourself? I guess

292
00:52:58.899 --> 00:53:06.100
nobody believes it. I mean, I, I, I'm ok with being a quiet person too. Really? I am. If I was

293
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:11.729
sitting there, I probably wouldn't be saying much. I'd be like, yeah, that was good. I'm hoping

294
00:53:11.739 --> 00:53:12.489
you're doing that,

295
00:53:14.679 --> 00:53:20.810
but it would be cool just, you know, just for everybody else, not for me. If you would be more

296
00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:29.649
responsive, can you be just a little bit more responsive? Ok. Come on. It's just gonna be more fun

297
00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:35.590
and you're not gonna be so heavy because this, this message is heavy. You feeling the heaviness of

298
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:46.159
it a little bit. I am. So transitions are meant to move us and, and, and here's the thing when I'm

299
00:53:46.169 --> 00:53:52.120
in a transition and I don't think of it this way, but this is how I have to see it. This is how God

300
00:53:52.129 --> 00:54:00.969
is teaching me to understand it. And I want you to catch this too. Transitions are meant to move us

301
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.530
through the wilderness.

302
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:13.300
And if we understand that this is what is meant by it then we're going to be able to, to believe in

303
00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:20.010
God so much more and trust him for what comes next. So every time I'm in a transition, I'm gonna say

304
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:29.030
God, I know what this is. This is a wilderness. I'm in a moment in which you're not trying to keep

305
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:38.199
me here. You're trying to build me up here. This is not a moment to destroy me, but this is meant to

306
00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:40.570
destroy the limitations that are in me.

307
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:50.639
You're here to build up my life, not to tear it down. You're here to show me so much more why I can

308
00:54:50.649 --> 00:54:58.270
believe in you so much more. Why I could put my faith in you in this transition of my life. You are

309
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:08.120
not here to destroy me. You are here to destroy death in me. And by belief that you cannot do what

310
00:55:08.129 --> 00:55:19.770
you have promised. Wow. You know, God, God sees your physical needs. He sees your emotional ones.

311
00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:29.080
He's aware of our spiritual limitations. He knows what we need materially. He knows what's happening

312
00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:37.979
in our lives relation and, and you have to understand that God wants to meet all of this together

313
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:44.840
for us in every way. I want to read a passage to you that proves that God sees what we are going

314
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:50.699
through in Exodus chapter three verses six and seven. It says I am the God of your father, the God

315
00:55:50.709 --> 00:55:57.090
of Abraham. I'm the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. And so what God does is that He identifies

316
00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:06.340
who He is and the faithfulness that we can trust. That's where our faith is built on. It is built on

317
00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:13.320
God's faithfulness for generations. And then he says, when Moses heard this, he covered his face

318
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:20.810
because he was afraid to look at God. And, and when God reveals himself, you know, often in our

319
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:26.459
wilderness experience, we just don't feel worthy and we're covering up our faces. We're, we're

320
00:56:26.469 --> 00:56:30.719
trying to hide from the presence of God. And God is saying, why are you hiding from me in the

321
00:56:30.729 --> 00:56:37.000
wilderness? When what I'm trying to do is reveal myself to you. See, God didn't tell Moses to cover

322
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:43.649
his face. Moses just did that automatically. And what I feel happens sometimes to us is that we are

323
00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:48.340
covering our face when God is revealing His faithfulness.

324
00:56:50.879 --> 00:56:56.649
And then the next thing that happens is that the Lord tells Him, I have seen the oppression of my

325
00:56:56.659 --> 00:57:05.199
people in Egypt. And then he says, I have heard their cries of distress because of their harsh slave

326
00:57:05.209 --> 00:57:11.030
drivers. Yes, I am aware of their suffering. And so there's three things that God says in this

327
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:20.620
passage that you need to just anchor yourselves too. And the first one is I have seen it. The second

328
00:57:20.629 --> 00:57:29.770
is I have heard it. And the third is I am concerned about it. And every time you are in your

329
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:39.879
wilderness experience and you are dealing with your self doubt and then you are dealing with your

330
00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:49.209
lack of faith in the moment. I want you to remember this because what God does is that he shows up

331
00:57:49.219 --> 00:57:55.219
in moses' life and he tells him, you may think that I haven't seen it. You may think that I haven't

332
00:57:55.229 --> 00:58:00.229
heard it and you may even think that I'm not concerned about it, but I want you to know that that

333
00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:06.560
has always been a lie. I've seen it. I've heard it and I'm concerned about it. Listen, I don't know

334
00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:13.330
about you. I don't know what your heart needs today, but I want you to hear this from God. I see

335
00:58:15.729 --> 00:58:17.419
what is in you.

336
00:58:20.399 --> 00:58:29.250
I have heard what you are going through and I am concerned about you

337
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:41.280
every day when I wake up. I see God. You see me, you hear me and I know you're concerned about me

338
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:50.229
and I will not let this transition and this wilderness experience keep me from worshiping you.

339
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.810
You need to do that for yourself. You need to believe what God is saying and you know what it isn't

340
00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:06.600
just moses' interaction. But I want you to know the one who replaced Moses Jesus and Jesus comes and

341
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:12.229
in Matthew chapter six and in verse 30 and this is what He declares and he declares it so that

342
00:59:12.239 --> 00:59:18.780
people will understand. Sometimes it feels like God cares about other things more than useful. Then

343
00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:26.209
Jesus says, and if God cares so wonderfully for wild flowers that are here today and they are thrown

344
00:59:26.219 --> 00:59:34.270
into the fire tomorrow, then he will certainly care for you. And then he says, why do you have so

345
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.149
little faith?

346
00:59:37.939 --> 00:59:45.610
Why do you have so little faith goes, put your faith in this I care and I am concerned about you.

347
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:51.959
I'm not just caring for those things around you. I care about you.

348
00:59:54.120 --> 01:00:01.010
And then we can just move beyond the moment of pain in our life. Because the moment of pain in our

349
01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:09.080
life, whatever it is that we are facing and living and going through, it is essential right now for

350
01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:14.340
it to bring us closer to the heart of God. And the reason we wanted to bring us to the heart of God

351
01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:22.760
is so that we can then just be stronger for what comes next, be better. So we stop wandering in the

352
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:31.689
wilderness, but instead experience the wonder of worshiping in the wilderness instead as it leads us

353
01:00:31.699 --> 01:00:37.129
to the miracles that He has promised us. How many of you want to get out of this transition that

354
01:00:37.139 --> 01:00:43.000
you're in? How many of you want to get out of this wilderness? How many of you are ready for the

355
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:50.889
next step? How many of you are ready for? The next thing that God has in store for you? I I always

356
01:00:50.899 --> 01:00:53.280
thought, you know, the problem was

357
01:00:55.639 --> 01:01:02.919
that God, you know, was just still working things together. You know, like, you know, he had to, he

358
01:01:02.929 --> 01:01:11.879
had to, he had to convince that person had to do a work in a way that I just felt, you know, things

359
01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:18.370
needed to come together for my good. But then I started to realize that the main reason why I'm

360
01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:27.399
wondering it is because of me, it isn't the work that God has to do in other people. It isn't the

361
01:01:27.409 --> 01:01:33.350
work that he needs to do in the city. It isn't the work that he needs to do on the planet. It's the

362
01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:41.090
work that he needs to do in me. See, the story of the wilderness isn't about seeing the problem

363
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:49.969
outside of our own heart. See Moses gets called out for believing that the arm of God was too short.

364
01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:56.709
I don't know about you where it is in your life that you believe that the arm of God is too short to

365
01:01:56.719 --> 01:02:02.709
work for you. But I believe today that that is the reason number one why we are still wandering in

366
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:09.270
the wilderness. I'd like to blame other people. I love it. I'm good at it. I don't know about you

367
01:02:10.179 --> 01:02:17.610
over my lifetime. I have become an expert of pointing out all the things that are wrong outside of

368
01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.739
me. Oh, it's, it's just me, right.

369
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:30.429
But when the arm of God is short, God is saying Moses, the problem isn't pharaoh. I'll take care of

370
01:02:30.439 --> 01:02:38.270
him and it's up to hundreds of years of slavery in Egypt. I'll take care of that. It isn't even a

371
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:46.100
distance between Egypt and Canaan - I can lead you through that. It isn't even a lack of water or food or

372
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:52.840
a problem with any of that. I don't care about the ocean. I don't care about anyone who's behind you

373
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:58.790
chasing you. I don't care what they have in terms of weaponry, horses, chariots and the ability to

374
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:05.219
wipe you out. None of that matters. What I care about is, do you believe that my arm is too short?

375
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.219
Because if you believe that my arm is too short, here's what's gonna happen. Three days is gonna

376
01:03:14.229 --> 01:03:15.550
turn into 40 years

377
01:03:19.919 --> 01:03:25.649
and you seeing the promise, that's all you're gonna be able to do. But I want you to experience the

378
01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:31.689
promise. I want you to experience the journey of transformation. So, hey, I don't know about you,

379
01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:39.719
but today is a day in which we say, Lord, I want to get out of this transition. Yes, absolutely. But

380
01:03:39.729 --> 01:03:47.760
I'm not gonna be the one who spends more time in it than I need to. So I'm gonna turn to you with

381
01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:57.149
belief and I'm gonna ask you work in my life so my faith can grow so I can get out of this desert

382
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:03.679
and experience your promise. Instead, God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

383
01:04:10.909 --> 01:04:19.790
You guys ready to pray. Um Can you think of like one thing. Just maybe two,

384
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:26.659
two areas of your life where you just know you're not trusting God enough

385
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:38.879
where you just keep wandering, wasting time in the wilderness instead of becoming a worshiper in it

386
01:04:39.719 --> 01:04:47.370
and letting God just build up your faith. Is there, is there an area that you can think of?

387
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:57.050
Can you just, when I'm praying for you, can you just give that to God and just say God just, just

388
01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.409
change my way of seeing things, the way of living things, the way of experiencing things, just

389
01:05:02.419 --> 01:05:07.879
change it, change it, change it. I don't want to waste any more time wandering. I don't want to be

390
01:05:07.889 --> 01:05:13.620
in this desert longer than I need to. I don't want to live in this wilderness anymore. I want, I

391
01:05:13.629 --> 01:05:23.439
want to become a worshiper in spirit and truth and I want your faith in me to grow. And so father,

392
01:05:23.449 --> 01:05:27.330
you see what it is that we're thinking, you see what it is that we're offering you. You see what it

393
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:32.770
is that we're praying. You see where it is that we've been struggling and where we have been

394
01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:38.580
wandering in our wilderness. I pray that today would be a day of, of transformation for everyone

395
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:45.879
here, that everyone that is a part of this moment that they would experience the, the victory that

396
01:05:45.889 --> 01:05:53.800
you have so already declared over all of our lives. Lord, you are the deliverer, you are the healer,

397
01:05:55.060 --> 01:06:02.209
you are the provider you are the one who protects and gives us peace in every situation and

398
01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:10.280
circumstance. We will not declare over our lives. That which we already know is, is our reality, but

399
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:17.520
we will declare over our lives. The promises that you have made. I see where things are wrong. I

400
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:25.429
know where things need your intervention. Iii I don't have to profess over my life and over my

401
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:33.479
future devastating outcome, Satan is already doing that. I pray Lord that you would just change my

402
01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:41.770
mind and my heart and you would give me words instead that I wouldn't declare the end, but I would

403
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:47.010
instead declare a new beginning.

404
01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:57.280
It's not the end of me. It's not the end of you, but it's the start of something new. Lord, you are

405
01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:05.459
able, you are capable, you have promised to make all things new. Would you do that in our lives

406
01:07:05.469 --> 01:07:11.659
today? Would you change the season in which we're in the steps that we need to take and we

407
01:07:11.669 --> 01:07:19.479
experience together just the, the miracle that you have in store for us? Thank you for that. And we

408
01:07:19.489 --> 01:07:25.919
give this to you the things that we've been thinking, the things that we've been praying, the things

409
01:07:25.929 --> 01:07:30.739
that have been holding us back, the things that have been keeping us wandering, we surrender them to

410
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:39.409
you, Lord, so we can finally leave the wilderness and enter into your promise and we pray this in

411
01:07:39.419 --> 01:07:46.909
Jesus name. Amen. Amen will you receive that over your life. We receive that over our lives. We

412
01:07:46.919 --> 01:07:53.679
believe that for ourselves. Let's not get stuck. Let's just keep moving forward. God's got something

413
01:07:53.689 --> 01:07:57.979
great in store for all of us. Let's sing this song together and we're gonna wrap up this gathering

414
01:07:57.989 --> 01:08:02.689
and we're gonna hang out at the after party and I hope to get to know you and see you and, and hear

415
01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:08.449
from you too. And um and just be able to, to convey the concern that God has for you and thank you

416
01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:13.750
for being a part of this and, and the events that are coming up or opportunities for us to connect

417
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:20.529
to get to know each other. And so um the next ones that I'll be up and making announcements for

418
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:26.870
those are gonna be the ones that are speaking to you about getting connected, about making friends

419
01:08:26.879 --> 01:08:32.689
about discovering community. We're gonna be talking about small groups as well. Um We already have

420
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:39.529
14 small groups that meet at River's Edge. They meet both at the church and they meet in homes and

421
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.729
we wanna increase that number and we want to be able to have them in every neighborhood that you're

422
01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.729
in, that you can then just meet other people like yourself who are on a spiritual journey. So you

423
01:08:50.738 --> 01:08:56.429
can just grow with others in your faith. If you feel like you can lead a group or host a group or

424
01:08:56.438 --> 01:09:00.679
want to be a part of group. Well, in the next weeks you're gonna hear more about that and there's

425
01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:06.588
gonna be some sign ups that you're gonna be able to put your name down for in uh areas that we can

426
01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:13.318
then contact you and we're gonna be able to just see even more people in community here at Rivers

427
01:09:13.329 --> 01:09:16.970
Edge. You excited about that. It's not just about the Sundays, right?

428
01:09:19.089 --> 01:09:28.700
Awesome. Let's sing this song together this so it just wraps up. He's message, it's talking about

429
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:36.629
God can do anything and he is doing everything in our life. He has brought us through the, the, the

430
01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:43.270
darkness. He can part every sea, he can move every mountain. He has done it and he will continue to

431
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:49.270
do it. And he is helping us in our transitions. Let's sing this song called "Yes He Can."

432
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Let's sing those words together.

458
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:28.580
We'll see you all at the after party. Lovely snacks and, and drinks. Have a great Sunday. Take care.
