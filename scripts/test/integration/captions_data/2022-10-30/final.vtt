107
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:46.840
we're really well, you've seen also the progress through the different weeks, so we're really

111
00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:16.360
I just want to remind you that there is four ways to give uh it's really important because that the

112
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:23.160
ministry that we're doing here, that the church, the building, everything that you're seeing here is

113
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:29.210
really funded through your generous donation. So we really appreciate everything that you're giving

114
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:37.200
to that community, as we mentioned last week. Um we are in the year end process, we're almost

115
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:43.180
meeting our budget almost. So please continue to be generous. We want to thank you as well, because

116
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:50.680
in the year end, typically sometimes it's a little bit difficult. We have a much bigger gap to close,

117
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:57.150
we have a smaller gap to close this year, so that's really amazing. And we wanna thank you for that.

118
00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:03.130
And as I mentioned also, and we mentioned you a couple of times, it's not only about giving of our

119
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:07.720
financial resources, there are plenty of ways to support what we're doing here and we want to thank

120
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:15.740
you for your many ways of supporting that community. So don't forget the after party. Ok, Especially

121

123
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.140

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.280
So please welcome with me or dear Pastor Lorenzo.

130
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.660
So we are concluding this series that we're in called Fresh Start. Have you guys enjoyed it? If it's

131
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:28.590
if your Sunday then you don't know what I'm talking about, but we're glad that you're here. Welcome.

132
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:36.200
And uh every week we've been looking at how in the scriptures, God has been leading all of us to

133
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:44.900
revisit the past and no one wants to do that. Not in the way that God sometimes challenges us to do.

134
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:51.560
I think we like to do that on our own terms. We like to do that according to our old habits and

135
00:30:51.560 --> 00:31:00.160
patterns and the things that we are comfortable with doing, but we are in a place right now where

136
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:09.930
God is speaking to us about how we can revisit the past and learn from it, be challenged by it, be

137
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:18.670
transformed from it and experience something else so that we can have the future that God has in

138
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:24.770
store for us. But one of the things I wanted to talk to you about is found in this story in the book

139
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:33.980
of genesis and it's called the story of Lot and his family and Lot was a nephew of Abraham who

140
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:43.530
became Abraham who became the holder of the promise God visited Abraham and told him that he would

141
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:50.870
make of him a great nation. But he would have to leave the nation that he was a part of. He would

142
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:58.860
have to leave the land of his ancestors for a land that he did not yet know but that God was telling

143
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:05.650
him that he would possess. He was telling him that he would have to leave his past to experience a

144
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:12.090
glorious future and he had to leave everything that he knew for that which was unknown. And that's

145
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:20.130
why Abraham is considered such a hero of the faith because he was someone who was worshiping the

146
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:31.380
idols of his people of his ancestors. And then God showed up, revealed himself and made himself

147
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:37.840
known. And when Abraham began to share the story of how God had made himself known to him and what

148
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:44.800
he was asking him to do as he shared this with his family, Lot was the only one who was willing to

149
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:53.860
do the same. And so they became incredibly close, so close that God prospered them both equally. And

150
00:32:53.860 --> 00:33:00.280
it got to the point where God had prospered them so greatly that a decision would one day have to be

151
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:07.190
made that neither one of them wanted to make or was prepared to make or actually they tried to avoid

152
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:17.490
to make. That is except for Lot because Lot was the one who brought it up. Lot was the one who

153
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:24.040
saw it as a solution. Lot was the one who said, hey why don't we go our separate ways. And when he

154
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:32.170
said that he saw how God had prospered him and he saw how God had prospered Abraham but now his

155
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:40.240
tribe, their tribes people were fighting, they were arguing over the resources and and Lord just

156
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:50.030
said you know, I put my eyes on this beautiful lot of land and I think I'm gonna go and settle there.

157
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:59.520
And so the story from there gets worse gets worse for Lot and it gets increasingly better for

158
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:07.160
Abraham and it was that decision that they made that day that really put everything else into motion

159
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.030
and I'm sure the same things happen to you. You you made a decision at some point in your life and

160
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:20.510
then you just saw your life go in a completely different direction. You envisioned something

161
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:26.140
completely different for yourself when you made that decision and you imagined that the blessing and

162
00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:32.160
the prosperity that you had experienced was going to continue. In fact you made the decision,

163
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:40.250
believing that things would get better for you, not worse. But in the case of Lot, there were then a

164
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:47.530
series of smaller decisions that he would make in a series of big decisions that he would make that

165
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:59.540
would then lead up to him taking up residence in a place that God never wanted for him or for his

166
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:09.620
family. So, let's take up the story here in Genesis 19. And today we're gonna talk about Being

167
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:17.930
rescued in Genesis 19. And in chapter 19 and verse 12, it says this that meanwhile the angels

168
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:26.540
questioned Lot. Do you have any other relatives here in the city? Because I want you to get them

169
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:34.930
out of this place? Your sons in law? Your sons, daughters? Anyone else? Because we're about to

170
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:41.530
destroy the city completely. Because the outcry against this place is so great that it has reached

171
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:49.500
the Lord and he has sent us to destroy it. And so Lot rushed out to tell his daughters fiancees

172
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:57.530
quick get out of the city because the Lord is about to destroy it. But the young man thought that he

173
00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:06.880
was only joking. And at dawn the next morning the angels became insistent hurry. They said to Lot:

174
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:15.850
take your wife and your two daughters who are here and get out right now or you will be swept away

175
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:27.200
in the destruction of the city. And when Lot still - it says it right here - hesitated. Then the angels

176
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:38.120
had to seize his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters and rushed them to safety

177
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:46.160
outside of the city. For the Lord was merciful. And when they were safely out of the city, one of

178
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:54.990
the angels ordered run for your lives and don't look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to

179
00:36:54.990 --> 00:37:02.560
the mountains or you will be swept away. Oh no, my Lord, Lot begged, you have been so gracious to me

180
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:09.990
and you have saved my life and you've shown such great kindness but I cannot go to the mountains

181
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.380
because disaster would catch up to me there and I would soon die. See there is a small village

182
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:27.370
nearby. Please let me go there Instead, don't you see how small it is? Then my life will be saved.

183
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:34.130
And alright, the Angel said, I will grant your request. I will not destroy the little village. But

184
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:43.150
hurry - escape to it for I can do nothing until you arrive there. And this explains why that village

185
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:50.350
was known as Zoar, which means little place. And then Lot reached the village just as the sun was

186
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:59.140
rising over the horizon and then the Lord rained down fire and burning sulfur from the sky on the

187
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:07.150
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and he utterly destroyed them. Along with the other cities and villages

188
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:15.600
of the plane, wiping out all the people and every bit a vegetation. But Lot's wife looked back as

189
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:25.570
she was following behind him and she turned into a pillar of salt historically. And interestingly

190
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:31.830
enough to this day, this area that we're talking about overlooks the dead sea and there's still no

191
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:43.670
vegetation that can grow there and that area is known for its salt. It's known for the sea itself

192
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:55.880
that creates at the lowest level this salt. That is a natural phenomenon where people go for its

193
00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:03.790
healing properties or just to be able to uh float in it. But it's not something that is utterly

194
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.560
enjoyable. It's just something that's more of an experience. But that can be quite actually

195
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:16.660
dangerous. Um if if you don't do it right. And when you look at the story, it's interesting to see

196
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:26.790
how something in the past still carries consequences even today. And that speaks to what God is

197
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:35.700
telling Lot. And all of us, not just in that story, but in the story of our own lives. There's a

198
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:44.430
passage In Genesis 13 that we're going to look at. It starts at verse 12. And it gives us a little

199
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:52.680
bit of an understanding of the story that I was reading to you earlier, Abraham settled in the land

200
00:39:52.690 --> 00:40:01.500
of Canaan And then you'll see that does something, he moves his tents to a place and I want you to

201
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:11.810
see that it is only near Sodom and he settled among the cities of the plane.

202
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:26.750
And then in verse 13. But the people of this area were extremely wicked and they constantly sinned

203
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:33.820
against the Lord and after Lot had gone, the Lord said to Abraham, look as far as you can see in

204
00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:39.690
every direction, north and south, east and west because I'm gonna give you all the land as far as

205
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:46.160
you can see to you and to your descendants as a permanent possession. And we see the difference

206
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:53.680
between the choices of Lot and Abraham. And you'll have to excuse me today, I'll do my best.

207
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:10.170
Everybody wants to run for the doors now because I think I have COVID, but it's not that. So what's

208
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:19.290
happening in the story is that when they split up, each going to their own section, Lot chooses a

209
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:26.020
place where he sets up camp and you can see that he doesn't go directly into Sodom at that point,

210
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:34.640
but he gets just close enough and that's what happens to us spiritually. We don't we don't just turn

211
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:43.900
away from God and his promises, we don't turn away from God fully, but we get close enough to that

212
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:59.260
which is sin so that we can just kind of have a place in both be faithful to God honor him, but

213
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:06.630
still have fun. Which we we call fun, but which what God is calling wickedness,

214
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:18.120
not really living for God, but somehow still attaching ourselves to the past. And so you see that Lot

215
00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:31.110
from the very beginning left with Abraham. But I don't think everything left Lot. And at

216
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:39.670
the first opportunity that he really gets to leave Abraham, he takes it. Like why do this at

217
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:46.800
this point And at this stage? Because at this point and at this stage he feels like he can do this

218
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:53.610
on his own. He doesn't need the blessing of Abraham and the promise of God given to Abraham, he

219
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:59.270
feels like he can, he can be blessed on his own and so he goes out on his own and when he goes out

220
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.070
on his own instead of experiencing the blessing of God, the way that Abraham was experiencing it, he

221
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:13.610
just found himself going back and back not to her where they were from, which would be modern day

222
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:23.790
Iraq, but going back, there's something that was similar enough and he puts his tent as close as he

223
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:33.250
can to it without fully outright, you know, renouncing God and I want you to think about where in

224
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:41.110
your life, you may have done something similar or where that may be happening in your life, like

225
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:51.170
right now, and the idea is that we want to get as close as we can to Sodom without actually having

226
00:43:51.170 --> 00:44:00.760
to live there and to be there and to remain there and and to and to live life there except

227
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:09.150
what ends up happening to Lot is what ends up happening to all of us when God calls us out of our

228
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:15.810
past and we try to find a way to kind of merge our two lives together again, where we try to merge

229
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:22.360
the past and the future, where we try to live in the present, but still hold on to segments of the

230
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:32.650
past. We try to set up our tent in our camp as close as we can to wickedness and then expect that

231
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:40.320
God would continue to bless us. Like when we were fully committed to him on our spiritual journey.

232
00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:50.700
And so Lot is living this life where he's tormented on the inside and now that that that torment is

233
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:59.550
revealing itself on the outside. And it's revealing itself through his decision making. First

234
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:05.080
his decision is to leave Abraham then his decision is to go into an area that was known for its

235
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:11.780
wickedness. He knew what it was for. But he goes there anyways and then he sets up his tent there

236
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:19.930
and he gets as close as he can to it and look at what happens in genesis 14 and verse 11 and 12, the

237
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:27.580
Bible says that by the time the story continues from him setting up his camp there. Look at how,

238
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:34.500
look at how things are getting worse for Lot. It says in verse 11 that the victorious invaders

239
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:41.110
then plundered sodom and gomorrah and they headed for home and and taking with them all the spoils

240
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:49.930
of war and the food supplies. And look at this, they also captured Lot, Abraham's nephew, who where

241
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:53.590
where does he live? He now lives in,

242
00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:02.380
he's not in a tent near it now. He's in it.

243
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:14.610
Man. When I read that when I saw that I said, God will convict me, Speak to me, where I'm setting up

244
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.310
my tent

245
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:25.410
knowing that there's wickedness there. But thinking that somehow I'm going to be better and stronger.

246
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.640
Somehow I'll be able to escape it.

247
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:36.730
And instead of that happening. Look what happens now. He's he's not near it anymore. He's right in

248
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:46.420
the city, he's right and Sodom. And and then what happens is that invaders come and they all get

249
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:54.560
captured and they get carried off and look what happens everything that they own. In the following

250
00:46:54.560 --> 00:47:00.360
verse. In the following verse carried off with everything,

251
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.200
everything he owned.

252
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:18.200
And it's interesting to me that sometimes we can lose everything and still not turn away from the

253
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:28.030
things of the past. Come on. Is that is that just me, is that someone else here who can relate even

254
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:37.590
after we've lost everything, we just keep doing the same thing. And what happens in the story is

255
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:46.340
that again, God wants to rescue Lot and he does it through Abraham. And in Genesis 14 verse 16, it

256
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.870
says this, that Abraham look at this, goes to war

257
00:47:53.190 --> 00:48:04.010
to save Lot and his family and he makes an alliance with other tribes and they go out and they

258
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:11.220
attacked the invaders and look at this. They brought back his nephew Lot with his possessions and

259
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:20.240
all the women and all the other captives. He he doesn't just free Lot, but he frees everybody. Can

260
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:29.440
we say amen to that? I mean, God makes it known that Lot was captured. Abraham hears this and he

261
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:39.660
goes to war because Abraham is not allowing Lot to be lost?

262
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:51.050
And I know that there are people in our lives who care about us? I know the Holy Spirit cares about

263
00:48:51.050 --> 00:49:02.800
us. There's a scripture that tells us that the Holy Spirit actually intercedes on our behalf and

264
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:11.260
that God is actually always interceding on our behalf, Jesus is always interceding on our behalf.

265
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:19.420
That even when you think you are alone in this world, I want you to know that the one who gave the

266
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:31.550
promise to Abraham has given it to you and he will not allow you to be lost. And I love the fact

267
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:42.190
that in this story, everything that had been lost, guess what happens? It gets restored. Lot is

268
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:52.460
rescued and is restored. But the problem is that Lot decides to return back to Sodom and Gomorrah.

269
00:49:55.870 --> 00:50:01.590
I don't know why he's so stubborn about this. And then I remember. Yeah, but that's that's who I am.

270
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:11.670
I'm really stubborn. What am I judging the dude for when When I do the same thing when God keeps

271
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:20.970
rescuing me only for me to return back to the place that he rescued me from? Come on, Are you guys

272
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:26.720
with me? Is this like you guys asleep on me? No. Mhm.

273
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:29.500
Thanks.

274
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:39.240
But I do see that in verse 32, the story continues

275
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:46.320
Finally, Abraham says, Lord, please don't be angry with me. But if I speak one more time. And what

276
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.910
he does, he starts at at like, Hey, can you find like 50 people. So you don't destroy the city of

277
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:59.070
Sodom and Maura, can you find 40? Can you find 30? And then he goes down all the way to 10 and then

278
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:04.930
he says speak one more time, suppose only 10 are found there. And then the Lord replied, then I will

279
00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:09.600
not destroy it for the sake of the 10. But we know how the story ends. You can't even find 10 people.

280
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:16.210
And the reason that Abraham goes all the way down to 10 is that he's thinking about Lot and his

281
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:25.990
family, he's thinking about God, please rescue him one more time. Don't let him die. And you can see

282
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:32.690
that that God is not out there to destroy, he's out there to save. And what he's looking for is for

283
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:39.830
people who are willing to say I'm worthy of you to be saved. Save me. Pick me. He's looking for

284
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:45.580
a response on our side so that he doesn't do any of that doesn't want to do that. But he's only

285
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:51.410
saying that if I could even find just 10 in the city, but he can't find them because not even his

286
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:58.130
daughters or his wife or his son in law's future ones at that are interested and following the God

287
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:06.660
that Lot believes in a city that is completely devoted to other gods and to themselves. And so in

288
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:15.540
the story we see that Abraham is still doing the intercession an intercession that rescues them from

289
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:21.920
certain destruction because God ends up sending his angels to rescue Lot and his family anyways.

290
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:29.340
So he can't follow through on the promise of not destroying the entire city. But he can still save

291
00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:35.360
Lot. And I think about that and I think God, wow, you're so amazing because what you're trying to do

292
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:42.920
and teach us in all of this is that you refuse to give up on any of us. Like your intention is to

293
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:51.400
make sure that none of us are lost, even the ones that are unwilling to be rescued. Because we

294
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:58.880
discovered that that Lot's wife - who we never find out her name by the way - or his daughters are not

295
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:07.210
interested in leaving. And you remember that even Lot hesitated and in that hesitation, the angels

296
00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:17.410
have to take them by the hand and lead them out of the city. Like it was forcefully done. The

297
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:27.280
intervention was really clearly done. So that they would not be lost. None of them would be. But

298
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:38.080
unfortunately, in verse 16 of Chapter 19, we read that Lot hesitated and the angel sees them and

299
00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:44.780
what it says, because the Lord was still merciful. Can we say amen to that. How many times has God

300
00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:52.170
just done that with us? Just just forcefully taken us by the hand and just God is out of a situation

301
00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:58.230
because we wouldn't do it like we were stuck in that city. We were we were comfortable there. We

302
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:02.790
were living our life there. We thought there's nothing wrong with this. There's nothing wrong. This

303
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.740
is how everybody else is living. This is how everybody else parties. This is how everybody else does

304
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:14.510
it. I can do this too. And I can still believe in God, I can still have my life in both places. I

305
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:21.030
can still do the same thing. But God is saying, no, you don't understand. You can't be like that. I

306
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:29.970
need you to be not like a Lot. I need you to be like Abraham in the story were shown both people

307
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:39.050
because God says, my blessing is with one, not the other. And so when Lot chose his land, he chose

308
00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:45.720
it. And then he chose it for its proximity to wickedness.

309
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:57.720
But when God gave Abraham the land, he told him, you can walk as far as you want in every direction

310
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:05.270
and because you're faithful to me, I'm gonna give it to you all. Can we say amen to that?

311
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:18.340
See? Lot keeps getting invaded, keeps losing everything. He keeps having to start over. Mhm. And his

312
00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:28.760
life and the life of his family gets worse. But not that of Abraham And I believe that God is here

313
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:37.110
to rescue us from our own hesitation. Yeah. So I know that we've got that hesitation in us just like

314
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:46.610
Lot had it. Like he knows that God is going to destroy the city. He's just warned him and he's seen

315
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:52.450
spiritual beings become physical and take on a physical form. He knows that they're angels and

316
00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:59.830
they're there and they're telling him what's going to happen. And yet he's still hesitating and I

317
00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:07.420
know that God has revealed himself to each of us. He has shown himself, he has made himself known.

318
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:16.180
And yet somehow there's still a hesitation in us. There isn't this complete commitment that God is

319
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:28.120
looking for from us. And so in Genesis 19 and verse 26, we see how that hesitation that was in Lot

320
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:41.270
is actually really pronounced in his wife and when Lot's wife looks back as she was following behind

321
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:49.790
her husband, the scripture says that she was turned into a pillar of salt and in the original

322
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:57.730
language, it wasn't just like a look back like this. It was a look back with yearning.

323
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:09.840
It was regarding the past with sorrow in her heart that she was leaving it behind. You understand

324
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:15.890
the difference. You know, we always think that it was just because she looked back. No, no. What was

325
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:23.570
happening in her heart was that she didn't, she didn't want to let it go at all. And what what Jesus

326
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:30.690
does is that when he comes and he starts teaching on on what it looks like to follow God and to live

327
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:39.130
for him and and to live in his kingdom and how the rest of the earthly kingdoms are under the power

328
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:46.720
and the sway of the evil one and and and under the authority of satan himself that in luke 17 in

329
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:56.480
verse 32 Jesus says these words remember what happened to Lots Wife.

330
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:08.550
And what Jesus does is that he takes a story of the old testament everybody knew and he relates it

331
00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:19.470
to his time. But more importantly, he reminds us that we are still living in those days. Yeah. And

332
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:26.250
when Jesus talks about the present, when he utters these words, he's also talking about a future

333
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:38.880
time and when he talks about this future time, he says remember Lot's wife, not just for today but

334
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:47.950
for tomorrow. And Jesus is telling us that it's it's it's something that's in all of us. This desire

335
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:55.550
to camp outside the city that we think that's as close as we're gonna get. But then we end up in the

336
00:58:55.550 --> 00:59:03.570
city and then after we've been taken out of the city and we have a choice now never to go back, what

337
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:10.740
do we do? We go back to the same city, we go back to the same way of living. And then then God says,

338
00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:16.120
but why would you go back to the same way of living? When I've been trying to get you out of there

339
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:24.290
all along and then all of a sudden the angels come and and God forcibly even sends them and reveals

340
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:30.420
himself and and and takes you by the hand and leads you out of that city. And then even then you

341
00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.440
still look back wanting it.

342
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.300
And then Jesus comes and says remember Lot's wife

343
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:54.260
and I know that I can't have the future God wants in my life if I take my decisions the way Lot did.

344
00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:04.270
But I thank God that there are Abrahams in my life who intercede from me

345
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:14.100
and when you're part of a community of faith, I want you to imagine it becomes your Abraham. I want

346
01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:19.190
you to imagine that that God is always your Abraham, no matter where you go. That that he's always

347
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:26.620
interceding for you. That he will come when the invaders have taken you and everything that you own

348
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:35.850
away from you, he will come and he will bring it back. He will restore it. I want you to believe in

349
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:43.380
that Jesus today, I don't know what it is that you've lost. I don't know what's been taken from you.

350
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:53.580
I don't know how it's been taken, but I do know that Jesus can bring it back. He can restore it just

351
01:00:53.580 --> 01:01:00.750
like he did for Lot and then we have to make a different decision not go back into Sodom, but go

352
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:08.870
where Abraham instead is going, can we say amen to that follow him out to the promised land and not

353
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:11.880
try to create our own promised land.

354
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Lot wanted his own promises fulfilled his way,

355
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:33.570
but we can only see it fulfilled and experience blessing God's way. And God is offering us that

356
01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:37.310
right now. Can we pray together? We're good.

357
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:49.150
And so Father, as you see us and know us. You see exactly what we're camped, how close we are. Or if

358
01:01:49.150 --> 01:02:00.490
we're in the midst of it, you see us lost in our brokenness and you are ready to rescue us and

359
01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:05.550
deliver us just like you did over and over again for Lot

360
01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:12.870
and you delivered him from certain destruction. And I know that your heart, your desire is to do the

361
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:20.850
same. And then you also give us a warning. A warning of Lot's wife who wasn't saved, who wasn't

362
01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:29.430
rescued, who like the rest of the citizens of those cities perished that day. You don't want us to

363
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:37.380
perish. You want us to experience the power of your presence that brings the fulfillment of your

364
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:45.580
promises. That leads to the blessings that you have in store for us so that we can walk in every

365
01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:52.020
direction and believe that you are not only with us, but that you are blessing us to experience the

366
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:59.810
fulfillment of all that you have for us. Thank you for every person that is here. Thank you for the

367
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:05.830
struggles that were able to identify in your presence to bring them before you and to say, God

368
01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:14.820
deliver me from them. Set me free from these weaknesses. Set me free from these traps of wickedness.

369
01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:24.200
Set me free, deliver me just like you came time and time again to deliver Lot, deliver me rescue

370
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:33.870
me and we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank you everybody. God bless you. Thank you so much.

371
01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.110
And I'm glad that we have an opportunity to just close out this gathering with this song that's

372
01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:44.830
called Not Afraid. And I would invite you to just stand as we would just do that together. And um

373
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:53.120
and I know that it's it's the kind of heavy um message that we sometimes you know it gets us to

374
01:03:53.120 --> 01:04:02.140
really reflect upon where we are and where God wants to bring us. But I need you to remember that

375
01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:09.500
God is the rescuer. He is the intercessor, He is the deliverer. He is the one that wants to bless

376
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:17.160
your life with his promises and give you all that he has desired in his heart for you. But there are

377
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:24.870
decisions that we need to make and if we will make decisions differently, it will release the

378
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:33.540
blessing of God in our lives. We're ready to receive that. And so father, thank you for that. Thank

379
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:39.460
you for that. And so let's sing this song together and then we'll have a great opportunity to just

380
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.820
hang out and just talk at the after party. We'll see you there, okay?

407
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.890
Thank you Lord. We're not afraid. Praise God.

408
01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:42.210
Wow. Thank you, worship team. That's amazing. It's me, T-RECC, again with my awesome roar. [Awesome roar] I'm
