11
00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:30.704

12
00:08:30.714 --> 00:08:37.424
there is some room also uh in, in the in uh there's some space in our room this morning. So it's

13
00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:43.364
time for trying a little bit of stretching. OK? Just making sure everything is working properly. OK?

14
00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:48.164
Uh And, and let's just start by some hand clapping. OK? Just making sure everything works. OK. Let's

15
00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:48.984
try that. OK.

16
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.880
Let's let's clap more like if we want to congratulate Jesus and God for everything that he has done

17
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:04.530
for us or will OK. Yeah, that's better. Yeah, exactly. Excellent. Excellent, perfect. So now let's,

18
00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:09.989
let's go a little bit further. OK? With just like some stretching like this. OK. Let's try this. OK.

19
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.979
Perfect. The other end if it's still working. Yeah, exactly. So it will be better for bigger hang

20
00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:21.349
hand clapping. Excellent. So now the last exercise that I want to do with you this morning and as I

21
00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:27.840
already explained uh in the past because if we want to do some dancing move, uh I'm really known for

22
00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:35.190
uh extreme dancing move. Uh I'm a two by four dance specialist. So that's the kind of flexibility

23
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.679
that I have. So that right now I'm really intense right now. OK. So I'm just in the mood. So just

24
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:46.169
try a little bit some flexibility with this like this. OK. Try this, but you need to go a little bit

25
00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:50.640
outside of your rank. OK? Just say don't be, don't, don't, don't be worried. There's a lot of space

26
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:56.409
in the room. OK, perfect. Yeah. Is it working properly? Yeah, good. OK. So now we're coming back to

27
00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:59.340
the hand clapping to welcome our worship team. OK, guys.

28
00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:06.989
Good morning, good morning, everyone. So wonderful to see you here.

29
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:15.239
The first song we're gonna start with is called Forever and through your trials, through your celebrations,

30
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:24.000
through the hard times, through the good times. He is with us. He's faithful. He's strong. God is forever. Amen.

66
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:53.540
So good morning again. What a wonderful time we had this morning with the worship team. And now

67
00:28:53.550 --> 00:29:00.520
it's time for kids to uh go in their classroom. So your moment has come. Uh Thanks for being with us.

68
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:07.000
Uh Right now. So there's a wonderful uh program prepared for you in the annex um about announcement

69
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:16.535
this week. Uh Let's start first with uh our new girls ministry. The women Ministry for Girls of all

70
00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:25.135
ages. You are welcome to attend that first event. Unlikely royalty. With our dear Patricia, which is

71
00:29:25.145 --> 00:29:27.994
the new ministry leader for that ministry.

72
00:29:30.849 --> 00:29:39.689
So if you want uh take a look at your right, my left Patricia is there uh with the sign up sheet. So

73
00:29:39.699 --> 00:29:45.239
don't forget to sign up with her. Uh She's the one holding the paper and that's really important to

74
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:52.099
register on that paper. Please mention as well if you need child care for that day because child

75
00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:59.503
care will be offered. Uh So we want to know exactly the kind of support that will be needed for the

76
00:29:59.512 --> 00:30:07.182
child. So please mention that to her as well. And the same thing also for the bakery and all the

77
00:30:07.192 --> 00:30:14.062
treats that will be prepared by her. Just know that she is a former. She owned our bakery for 10

78
00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:22.276
years. So please subscribe in mass to that event. I've asked if men were allowed to that event to

79
00:30:22.286 --> 00:30:30.276
taste those bakeries and she specifically mentioned me that we were excluded. So uh as an answer to

80
00:30:30.286 --> 00:30:37.156
that, we launched the guy's ministry. OK. So that's really how it works. It's, it's always that it's

81
00:30:37.166 --> 00:30:43.206
really peaceful in a community like us. And so there was competition and then obviously we inserted

82
00:30:43.215 --> 00:30:48.985
that competition. So guys, I don't know what we were gonna bake probably bacon, but uh

83
00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:56.030
we probably have a lot of cook that are experimented in the bacon cookery.

84
00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:04.300
Coming back to something really important about the guys ministry and one of the most important

85
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:13.510
holidays in, uh, a Christian legacy after Easter and, uh, Christmas, which are really, uh, top

86
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:21.880
priority. There's obviously, uh, Father's Day. Ok. Uh, and this is next Sunday. Ok. For those of you

87
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:29.069
who aren't knowing me well, sometimes I'm doing some kind of irony. Uh, so, so, so don't take, uh,

88
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:36.089
each words for truth. Uh, but basically the dates are good but the rest you need to really filter

89
00:31:36.099 --> 00:31:44.160
what I'm saying. OK. Uh Coming back to next week, Father's Day. Yes. Uh You will have also more

90
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:51.290
information about the um the uh men's ministry that we will share with you. Uh There will be a

91
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.310
brunch also by the community kitchen. So brunch time with,

92
00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:03.574
I don't know, but uh a little scoop for you this morning, there will be hamburger and chili as well.

93
00:32:03.584 --> 00:32:10.844
So I don't miss that special Sunday with uh Father's Day. Uh And there will be a lot of surprises in

94
00:32:10.854 --> 00:32:20.510
that uh wonderful Sunday. So be there uh to attend that wonderful uh event next Sunday. Also, there

95
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.469
is our uh U T C event. Unite the church worship night coming. That's really important. And please

96
00:32:26.479 --> 00:32:32.599
note the T and not the F OK? Because if you're attending to a U F C event, you're not at the good

97
00:32:32.609 --> 00:32:40.130
place. OK. So that's similar to a fighting, ultimate fighting combat, but we're fighting with song,

98
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:47.130
OK? And we're celebrating a wonderful fighter who fight death. And uh fight for us, which is Jesus

99
00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:54.109
and God. But that's another thematic. So don't expect a ring here, our fathers, but we will be with

100
00:32:54.119 --> 00:33:00.760
guitar and the piano and all of the wonderful voices of Rivers Edge and other churches that will

101
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:08.810
join us for that wonderful event. So U F C worship night, OK. Next announcement this morning that we

102
00:33:08.819 --> 00:33:14.739
wanted to share with you uh the tech team. So if you want to join a wonderful team, uh that's a

103
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.479
pretty young team. And we had a problem with that internally because we need to manage the average

104
00:33:19.829 --> 00:33:26.300
of each group. OK. Age average of each group. So that team is really young. OK. So we need more

105
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:32.530
experienced people in that. So we're not saying old because old is obviously uh banned from uh the

106
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:39.719
church and the world today. So we're, we're not doing ageism, segregation by ages. So right now, if

107
00:33:39.729 --> 00:33:45.859
you're uh I'm kidding. OK. If you're old or young, you can join the tech team. OK, guys. So, but

108
00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:50.439
seriously, that's a wonderful dynamic team. They want, they're gonna teach you if you don't know

109
00:33:50.449 --> 00:33:58.104
nothing about tech, they will teach you a really patient team. So guaranteed. Uh And they just gonna

110
00:33:58.114 --> 00:34:03.435
help you acquire some new, new skill and you will have the opportunity to serve that community. So,

111
00:34:03.444 --> 00:34:10.435
does that make sense? I don't Yeah, perfect. So tech team don't miss these guys ask them. Uh uh And

112
00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:16.039
please mention them your interest for that team. Uh four ways to give, that's something really

113
00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:21.858
important that we, we want to uh share with you. So if you want to support that community, obviously

114
00:34:21.868 --> 00:34:26.829
by serving the tech team or any other ministry, that's awesome. We really appreciate you serving.

115
00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:32.188
That's the only way to keep alive that community if we're all pitching in, in terms of effort and

116
00:34:32.198 --> 00:34:37.438
contributing to what is happening here at Rivers Edge. But there's another way also to supporting us

117
00:34:37.448 --> 00:34:44.030
and it is financially. So, if you wanna support us, please consider one of these four ways to give

118
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:50.719
and to uh sustain everything that is done here. And we wanna mention and also uh underline and

119
00:34:50.729 --> 00:34:55.020
highlight this morning, the fact that we're really thankful and we wanna thank you for your

120
00:34:55.030 --> 00:35:01.389
generosity, Sunday after Sunday, uh week after week. That's uh the way that we can honor our

121
00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:08.310
different uh engagements. So please welcome this morning. Uh our dear Pastor Lorenzo as he will teach

122
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.899
us the God's word this morning. Thanks.

123
00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:25.879
Awesome. So thanks Johan. Uh You never know what Johan is gonna say during announcement time. That's

124
00:35:25.889 --> 00:35:31.409
what makes it so much fun. Um So glad that you guys could be here as we wrap up this series called

125
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:37.419
uh Unlocking New Levels of Peace. We're gonna be actually transitioning into a new series in two

126
00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:42.419
weeks time. Next week, of course, is Father's Day. And so we're gonna be talking about redefining

127
00:35:42.429 --> 00:35:48.610
fatherhood as understood through our Heavenly Father. And uh the week after that, we're gonna start

128
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.679
a new series called Getting There. And I'll tell you more about that next week. But today, we're

129
00:35:53.689 --> 00:36:00.770
gonna focus on how we can experience peace of mind uh through presence. And of course, when we are

130
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:09.219
present, um it means that we have given all of our attention and focus to the moment in which we're

131
00:36:09.229 --> 00:36:17.919
in. And I believe that that's how God relates with us. He not only invites us into his presence, but

132
00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:28.260
he always gives himself entirely to us. He gives his full attention to each of us. That's who God is.

133
00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:36.389
And I know that when we find someone who gives us even just a fraction of that, we gravitate to them

134
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:43.169
and we sometimes give them attributes like this person is more than a friend there. They're like a

135
00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:51.360
brother, they're like a sister to me. Sometimes those people can feel closer than our own family

136
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:59.050
members because of the level of presence that they offer us. And when it's spoken of Jesus, it's

137
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:07.189
made clear in the scriptures that He is someone who sits closer to us than a brother. And that is

138
00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:14.629
the kind of presence that Jesus is offering each and every one of us today. And so no matter where

139
00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:25.020
we may feel unsettled in the area of peace in our lives, where we may be struggling with our mental

140
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:34.360
health and maybe have serious worries and concerns as well as anxieties and maybe depression. And I

141
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:41.239
want us to understand that the story that we're going to look at isn't a solution to all of that.

142
00:37:42.149 --> 00:37:47.800
What God does is that He gives us principles. He points us in a direction through his wisdom so that

143
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:55.709
we can begin to take the steps to becoming whole, to becoming healthy, to becoming thing that he

144
00:37:55.719 --> 00:38:03.320
always knew we would be if we would turn to His presence. And so what the presence of God does is

145
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:10.780
that it impacts us in ways that we haven't even fully understood yet. Because the more you practice

146
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:18.290
the presence of God, the more you realize what needed healing. And sometimes the area where God goes

147
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.199
is in an area where you felt fine. You, you didn't see that as the issue. You didn't see that as the

148
00:38:23.209 --> 00:38:30.530
problem. But, but what God's presence does is that it reveals what the problem is at the root level

149
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.909
and it exposes things within us that we sometimes are just not ready to deal with. And interestingly

150
00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:45.000
enough, sometimes that happens through external circumstances, we get pushed into things and maybe

151
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:54.840
sometimes even cornered into something. Sometimes we, we feel like, well, there's nowhere else to go

152
00:38:54.850 --> 00:39:03.870
but to retreat from this. And other times we realize that what God is doing is pushing us out of

153
00:39:03.879 --> 00:39:12.889
that corner to face the very thing that is really the root issue of why we cannot have peace. And so

154
00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:20.659
today, I pray that the word that we hear today is not the words of a man, but the words of God and

155
00:39:20.669 --> 00:39:27.260
that His wisdom would be what we would hear today, not mine because I, I have no wisdom to offer you

156
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:34.929
other than what the scriptures are offering. All of us. The wisdom of God is what we need to have

157
00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:35.590
breakthroughs.

158
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:44.389
That's what's going to bring the real healing in our lives. And so this moment is like for me, every

159
00:39:44.399 --> 00:39:50.040
other moment before it, it's always about making sure that we focus on how we can have that

160
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:55.719
breakthrough. And I'll tell you why, because if we don't have breakthroughs, then what we experience

161
00:39:55.729 --> 00:40:05.310
are levels of burnout that cripple and paralyze us and keep us from experiencing the fullness of the

162
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:11.320
power that God has always had there waiting for us to experience that breakthrough.

163
00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:17.669
And if you've ever been through a burnout or if you've ever used that word, and if you've ever

164
00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:24.810
described the situation that you were in with the word burnout like I have, then you know that what

165
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:32.590
has happened, if you're a spiritual person is that you have lost sight of the presence of God. Uh We,

166
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:38.629
we wouldn't label it like that because we would think that. Well, no, I mean, I never stopped

167
00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:44.250
believing in God. I never stopped believing in God. I never stopped believing in Jesus. I never

168
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.959
stopped serving him even in the context of a community of faith and giving myself to the study of

169
00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:57.879
His scriptures. And, but there's something that happens without even realizing is that we are

170
00:40:57.889 --> 00:40:58.800
leaking

171
00:41:00.939 --> 00:41:04.129
and we sometimes don't know where the hole is

172
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:11.320
and what God does with his presence is that he shows you where you're leaking so that you can

173
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.580
experience your healing.

174
00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:26.060
And so I, I don't want you um to be like 50% of us massively in this room because that's what

175
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.760
statistics tell us that are on the verge of burnout.

176
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:39.159
I want us all 100% of us to be on the verge of a breakout.

177
00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:50.100
I want us to have a breakthrough but better, I want us to have a breakout out of the prison that

178
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:58.820
we're in so we can experience the power that Jesus has for us. Yeah. Clap. That's good. Yeah.

179
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.830
And here's what I've been able to identify in my own life. OK. So there's a difference between being

180
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:15.060
stressed out and, and being burnt out and when we talk about being stressed out, when we talk about

181
00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:21.719
being burnt out. Um I want you to see that stress is generally short lived and it's related to a

182
00:42:21.729 --> 00:42:29.449
temporary project or event. And so we know that this has like an end date. It's just a season, it's

183
00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:34.219
a period of time and so it can stress us, but we know that it's not going to last forever. It may

184
00:42:34.229 --> 00:42:42.300
feel like that, but we also know that it sometimes can have a clear end date and sometimes it's a

185
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:47.679
little bit more vague, but there is one nonetheless. And so we have to know that this is coming to

186
00:42:47.689 --> 00:42:54.020
an end and, and, and that, you know, still produces stress in us, but burnout on the other hand,

187
00:42:54.030 --> 00:43:02.090
that's chronic, it's, it's something that feels like it's never ending. And I want us to see that in

188
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:07.889
the story that we're in that, that this is exactly what happens to the, to the main character in the

189
00:43:07.899 --> 00:43:14.590
story. Because what happens in the story happens to anyone who's ever experienced either stress or,

190
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:22.919
or even burnout because our body responds to this stress and burnout in a physical manner, in a

191
00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:31.540
mental manner and also in, in a emotional manner. In fact, when we think about how this has an

192
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:38.469
impact, it always has an impact on us first physically and we don't realize it. But, but that's

193
00:43:38.479 --> 00:43:45.679
where it's starting, it's starting physically, even though we cannot always identify it in the

194
00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:53.260
physical, we first identify it often in the mental and we sometimes can even just notice it first,

195
00:43:53.270 --> 00:44:00.739
of course, in the emotional because that's how we kind of let out what's happening on the inside.

196
00:44:00.929 --> 00:44:12.629
And so emotional is what we often reveal. And then we start to see that it's having an even deeper

197
00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:19.739
impact on us mentally. And then we tend to look at how it's impacting us physically. But I just need

198
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.719
you to understand that it's actually happening in reverse.

199
00:44:24.899 --> 00:44:32.250
And when you understand this, then you understand that, that what is actually happening to us is not

200
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:39.179
getting progressively better, it's getting progressively worse and, and it gets to the point where

201
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:47.340
your, your mental is so broken down. But it's because you're physically unable to sustain the mental.

202
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:57.750
I know physiologically the, the mind is what guides all things, but physically is where you're gonna

203
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:07.709
feel it first. And so Elijah is the story that we're in the character that we're looking at. And

204
00:45:07.719 --> 00:45:16.370
it's a story in which Elijah is afraid and he runs for his life. And the scripture that we're

205
00:45:16.379 --> 00:45:24.250
looking at is in first kings, 19 verses 3 to 5. And it says that Elijah was afraid and he ran for

206
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:31.689
his life. And when he came to Beersheba in Judah, that he left his servant there. And while he

207
00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:39.350
himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, he came to a broom bush and he sat down under it

208
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:46.800
and he prayed that he might die. And he actually said these words, I've had enough Lord take my life.

209
00:45:48.389 --> 00:45:49.280
And um

210
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:58.219
he says, I'm no better than my ancestors. And the reason he says that is because prior to this, his

211
00:45:58.229 --> 00:46:05.949
people had experienced a great miracle on Mount Carmel and fire. Actually physically came from the

212
00:46:05.959 --> 00:46:15.409
heavens and burnt up an offering that the prophets of bail could not light. And on this altar and

213
00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:24.879
upon which there was a sacrifice, Elijah's simple prayer brought the fire that consumed not just the

214
00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:31.989
sacrifice but its altar and all the gallons of water that had been poured over it. And then after

215
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.370
all of this, he looked for support in terms of destroying, not only all the remnants of this false

216
00:46:40.379 --> 00:46:48.870
God called bail, but he took it one step further and, and killed its prophets. The Bible says that

217
00:46:48.879 --> 00:46:55.449
he oversaw this personally and it gives us the impression that he may have been the one who was

218
00:46:55.459 --> 00:47:01.179
actually doing all the killing and there was 450 of them.

219
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:11.659
I've never even killed one person. I don't know what it looks like to kill 450. But anyone who's

220
00:47:11.669 --> 00:47:19.850
ever done that or witnessed that or been in the presence of that has experienced incredible trauma

221
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:27.250
from that. And I want you to imagine how physically drained uh Elijah is in this moment, but he's,

222
00:47:27.439 --> 00:47:33.840
he's also like mentally drained and he's emotionally drained and, and the whole time that there's

223
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:39.530
this massive build up of these prophets circling this altar and cutting themselves and, and for

224
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:45.870
hours they prayed and, and, and you can imagine how exhausted he was just after that, that, that he

225
00:47:45.879 --> 00:47:53.370
would then have to then proceed to have to uh take the life of 450 prophets so that they could

226
00:47:53.379 --> 00:48:00.330
strike out this, this falsehood from among them, the lies and the deception that came at the hands

227
00:48:00.439 --> 00:48:07.010
of these servants of Satan as opposed to him being the one who stood in the gap as a servant of God.

228
00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:15.189
And because of all that pressure that was on him, all that responsibility that he had to carry, you

229
00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:21.949
can imagine the weight that was upon him and how he felt crushed by that. I mean, he, he, he

230
00:48:21.959 --> 00:48:28.060
obviously was elated by what happened. But, but you know how you can have such a, a high that it

231
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:34.389
just can sometimes just keep soaring to the point where, well, you can't maintain that anymore. That,

232
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.500
that the, the, the further you've gone up,

233
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:49.050
the crash that follows, going down is so incredibly devastating. I want you to imagine that this is

234
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:55.209
what's happened to Elijah. And if you've ever gone through anything like this where you've just felt

235
00:48:55.219 --> 00:49:01.669
like you were on the pinnacle of success. Only to then just in a moment's breath later, just lose it.

236
00:49:02.419 --> 00:49:07.899
Maybe you felt that in your business and you felt that as an employee, you felt that having overseen

237
00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:15.000
a project and then everyone's cheering you one moment and then they're all speaking badly about you

238
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.449
in the lunchroom. The next,

239
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:24.159
maybe you've fallen in love and you think that it's reciprocated at the same level only to discover

240
00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:28.689
that um, they've had someone on the side the whole time.

241
00:49:32.229 --> 00:49:38.159
There are so many things that can happen to us in the moments of life that can just make us feel

242
00:49:38.169 --> 00:49:41.979
like we're on top of the world. And then the next moment, it just feels like we're just underneath

243
00:49:41.989 --> 00:49:48.340
it and, and, and that's what happens. It's like you, you don't even know you're in a stressful

244
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:53.979
moment. But, but all of a sudden you, you, you realize I'm not in just a stressful moment. I'm in

245
00:49:53.989 --> 00:49:59.909
actually a moment of burnout now because I don't know how to rebuild from here

246
00:50:02.129 --> 00:50:07.739
and, and, and here in the story that we're in, he says, I'm no better than my ancestors. And the

247
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:13.270
reason he says that is because he, he looks at himself and he feels like even though all he's done

248
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:19.610
is obey God because the people haven't turned away from bail, even though he's destroyed their

249
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:24.659
altars and destroyed their idols and he's destroyed their prophets. They still don't want to follow

250
00:50:24.669 --> 00:50:33.770
God. And he feels like a complete failure even though he had the most amazing moment of his ministry

251
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.360
life.

252
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:40.659
And so here are some of the mistakes that we can sometimes make

253
00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.820
when we are trying to outrun

254
00:50:48.239 --> 00:50:54.899
the things that are happening in our lives in the moment that we're in the first mistake. And we

255
00:50:54.909 --> 00:51:03.610
learned this from Elijah is that we can run away, but we can also run ourselves into the ground

256
00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:13.550
and, and what Elijah does is that he was so afraid that he ran for his life. But when you run from

257
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:22.000
your life, instead of offering up your life, when you try to hold on to your life, instead of

258
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:28.939
surrendering it to God, you're actually putting yourself in a position where you are gonna run

259
00:51:28.949 --> 00:51:35.419
yourself right into the ground. You see, he tried to run, not just from God's people, but he tried

260
00:51:35.429 --> 00:51:42.000
to run from his purpose, his calling. He tried to run from God that in that moment, he's basically

261
00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:50.389
saying, I'm done with all of this in the moment that we say things like that just like Elijah did is,

262
00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:59.959
is us manifesting the actual burnout and us bringing ourselves to burying us ourselves in the ground

263
00:51:59.969 --> 00:52:07.739
just like he wants to be, he wants to be dead. He wants to be buried. He wants his life to be over.

264
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:14.709
The second mistake that he makes in this is that he tries to do this all along. And the Bible says

265
00:52:14.719 --> 00:52:20.739
that when he came to Beersheba in Judah, that he actually left his servant there. And, and what we

266
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.929
often do is when we're going through something like this is that we make sure that no one comes with

267
00:52:25.939 --> 00:52:34.449
us. We just want to do it by ourselves because we are so broken by the burnout that we just make the

268
00:52:34.459 --> 00:52:42.280
stupidest decision to go it alone instead of going to people that can actually help us and heal us

269
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:48.969
and who can help us rethink what it is that we're talking about and getting a different perspective

270
00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:55.870
on things and showing us the wisdom of God that can lead us out of this situation that we're in. We

271
00:52:55.879 --> 00:53:06.649
just abandon everyone and we run away and we leave the people that can actually help us behind.

272
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:18.149
The third mistake that he makes is that he says that he is going to keep dwelling on the negative

273
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:26.399
that he's not intentionally doing this. Of course, right? But we're learning from Elijah's mistakes.

274
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:33.139
So we don't repeat them ourselves. But what he does is that he dwells on the negative and he instead

275
00:53:33.149 --> 00:53:37.770
of looking at the positive and all the great things that have happened, he's only seen the negative

276
00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:49.080
and he says, take my life, I'm no better than my ancestors. And then this is what he sees nothing

277
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:55.959
else. This isn't the whole story. But when you're in a burnout, that's the whole story.

278
00:53:59.199 --> 00:54:08.530
When you're not well, physically, mentally, emotionally, that's the whole story and you cannot trust

279
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.340
your version of the story.

280
00:54:12.629 --> 00:54:19.600
Your version of the story is coming out of a place of burn up. So your version of the story is

281
00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:30.409
completely wrong. It's not a little bit right. It is 100% wrong. You cannot trust it. And what we

282
00:54:30.419 --> 00:54:38.370
often do is we keep dwelling on the negative because that's the narrative we've believed and we keep

283
00:54:38.379 --> 00:54:45.489
repeating that narrative and we keep reinforcing that narrative. And that's why people often can't

284
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:51.989
forgive other people because they've been listening to their own negative version of the events of

285
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:52.659
the story

286
00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:02.179
and they are stuck and they don't know how to get unstuck because they just would rather hold on to

287
00:55:02.189 --> 00:55:09.530
the negative version of the story. And without realizing it taking steps towards a burnout.

288
00:55:14.429 --> 00:55:21.159
But sometimes the most spiritual thing that we can do in a moment like this is rest.

289
00:55:23.729 --> 00:55:33.280
And what God does with Elijah is that he leads him to a place of rest. I believe that he's with him

290
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:40.729
all along, but he's also guiding him. I mean, when you're traveling in the desert, you may not know

291
00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:46.110
where the trees are, but you can probably see them from a distance and, and he sees it from a

292
00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:52.989
distance and he makes his way over there. But the thing that Elijah is doing in this moment is he's

293
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.870
picking a good place to die. But what God sees is a good place to make him alive.

294
00:56:02.129 --> 00:56:08.600
And I want you to understand that every time we are thinking death, Jesus is thinking life that

295
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:18.129
every time we are taking steps towards our doom, Jesus is leading us to the depths of his living

296
00:56:18.139 --> 00:56:18.629
water.

297
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:29.790
And, and when all we see is desert, he sees an oasis and he's leading us to that very place where he

298
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:35.370
is going to refresh us. And so sometimes the best thing that we can do in a situation like that when

299
00:56:35.379 --> 00:56:41.370
we can't seem to break the patterns in which we're in. And we are in this anguished position and

300
00:56:41.379 --> 00:56:46.010
state when we are determined to see ourselves die and everything that we have just burn to the

301
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:53.679
ground, then that's when we just need to step back and rest because when we do and we turn to God in

302
00:56:53.689 --> 00:56:54.379
doing it

303
00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:06.840
because as great as the vacation is, it cannot heal your Brokenness. The only thing that can heal

304
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:14.510
your Brokenness is the presence of God. And the rest that you need isn't a vacation. The rest that

305
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.229
you need is to be found in the presence of the healer.

306
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:26.149
And we're always looking for ways to pleasure ourselves and entertain ourselves and to provide rest

307
00:57:26.949 --> 00:57:32.300
and relaxation for ourselves. But we don't realize that what we're missing in all this is actually

308
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:39.110
the presence of God. And because we're people of means and because we have more money now and more

309
00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:44.919
opportunity to travel the world than, than any generation before us, then that's how we imagine and

310
00:57:44.929 --> 00:57:50.479
envision that our rest and our peace is going to come. And we couldn't be further from the truth

311
00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:55.899
because the only place that you can experience true peace and true rest is in the presence of God

312
00:57:58.419 --> 00:58:01.620
and Jesus all along is trying to lead you to that place.

313
00:58:03.729 --> 00:58:09.929
And and I know this because in the scriptures, it tells us this in the way that, that Jesus comes

314
00:58:09.939 --> 00:58:16.600
alongside Elijah and, and, and in the form of an angel, this is what we see in First Kings chapter

315
00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:24.370
five, verse six, all the way down to nine. Let's read it together because what Elijah does is that

316
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:32.679
he lays down and he sleeps under the broom tree and I don't know about you. But sometimes like we

317
00:58:32.689 --> 00:58:40.379
escape through sleep, sometimes sleep doesn't even come to us even though we desperately want it

318
00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:46.389
because we just can't seem to shut off our, our brain and we're so anxious and worried that it keeps

319
00:58:46.399 --> 00:58:53.469
us up. Right? And then we just go through this cycle of, of just restlessness that, that, that rest

320
00:58:53.479 --> 00:58:59.489
is no longer a part of our lives in the way that we need it and even sleep eludes us. And, but, but

321
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:04.239
sometimes you get to a place where, where you're so depressed. All you can do is sleep. Have you

322
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:10.969
ever experienced that all you want to do is just sleep just to escape, having to be awake and to

323
00:59:10.979 --> 00:59:18.580
feel and, and, and to be reminded of everything that has gone wrong. And this is what Elijah does.

324
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:27.120
He just, he lays down to sleep because for him, sleep isn't just sleep like he doesn't, he doesn't

325
00:59:27.129 --> 00:59:34.540
want to wake up from a good nap. You know, God bless my, my afternoon naps sometimes when I get an

326
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.010
afternoon nap, it just, mm,

327
00:59:39.439 --> 00:59:45.689
like I, I just love it. I, I, I'm Italian. Italians need to nap.

328
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:56.060
It's in my DNA when, when I, when I studied in Italy and, and, and, and I, I lived there, I go. What

329
00:59:56.070 --> 01:00:00.260
is this foreign land that understands the power of a nap

330
01:00:02.389 --> 01:00:10.570
in the afternoon? Everything just shuts down just because people need to sleep a little. I love that.

331
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:19.209
It's not the only culture that does it. But, but it's where I, I experienced it. I'm like, if

332
01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:23.709
there's anything I'm gonna learn from this country and carry on for the rest of my life, it's this

333
01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:27.179
nap. And I have been faithful to that lesson.

334
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:43.820
But when Elijah lays down to sleep, here's what happens. He's actually laying down to die like he's,

335
01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:50.909
he doesn't want to wake up ever. And God knows how serious he is about this. And so this is what he

336
01:00:50.919 --> 01:01:03.629
does as he was sleeping, he sends an angel to touch him, wakes him up and then serves them food,

337
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:14.189
gives him food and water and gives him what he needs. Like he just does that for him. And then in

338
01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:19.479
verse six, he looks around and, and there beside his head, there's like bread baked on hot stones

339
01:01:19.489 --> 01:01:25.330
and, and a jar of water and he ate and he drank and then he's like that was nice. But you know what?

340
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:32.449
I still want to die and So he goes back to sleep and then the angel of the Lord lets him sleep for a

341
01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:37.719
little while and then he comes again and he touches him and he says, I need you to get up and I need

342
01:01:37.729 --> 01:01:45.719
you to eat more because there was a journey ahead of you that will be too much for you if you don't

343
01:01:45.729 --> 01:01:53.969
take what I have to offer. And the Bible says that Elijah gets up and he eats and he drinks and he's

344
01:01:53.979 --> 01:02:01.580
not so rebellious in his spirit that he doesn't obey God's instructions and the help of the angel he

345
01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:12.000
could have, but he doesn't, not from what we can tell. And the food that is given to him is enough

346
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:20.129
for him to travel. And here's the journey that's ahead of him. It's 40 days and 40 nights, but it's

347
01:02:20.139 --> 01:02:27.139
to Mount Sinai where the tablets were given to Moses and, and it's, that's why it's called the

348
01:02:27.149 --> 01:02:36.229
mountain of God because that's where he met with his greatest prophet. And now Elijah is being sent

349
01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:44.080
to that same place. And the Bible says that he does the journey of having to travel for 40 days and

350
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:54.860
40 nights. And I don't know about you. But um, I've, I, I've fasted before. I've never done a 40 day

351
01:02:54.870 --> 01:03:06.340
fast, but my brother did and he was going through some things and he went to a camp one day and, and

352
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:13.360
I brought him there and he says I'm going to stay here for 40 plus days. And the only thing I'm

353
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:16.330
gonna do is I'm gonna fast and pray because

354
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.250
my mind is just not right.

355
01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.530
And I remember trying to talk him out of it, you know, just like, no, it's just like too much. It's

356
01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:37.949
crazy. Like, it's not a good idea. And he's like, no, and you can't, you can't like call the camp

357
01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:44.260
and ask how I'm doing. You just, just trust that I'm going to be ok. And, and so I ended up talking

358
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:51.979
to the camp, you know, people that were in charge. And I said, hey, you know, like my brother is

359
01:03:51.989 --> 01:03:58.500
like, not in a good place. So he's gonna give you instructions and he's given me the same ones and

360
01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:05.949
just look out for his personal safety and just make sure he's ok. And um like please every day just,

361
01:04:05.959 --> 01:04:10.370
just check in on him on the cabin and just make sure that he's ok and if anything happens, you know,

362
01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:17.739
just let me know and, and I'll come down, uh, but please like, just do that. And so we had a, a

363
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:26.580
secret pact and didn't tell my brother about any of that and let my brother do his thing and, and 40

364
01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:28.409
days came up and I went to pick him up

365
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.510
and, you know, my brother is like my height, my size. I mean, except for the fact that he's got a

366
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:44.120
beard like we look like brothers. And when I went to pick him up after 40 days of having seen him

367
01:04:44.129 --> 01:04:46.739
fast, I did not recognize my brother.

368
01:04:49.459 --> 01:04:56.270
I mean, he was just literally skin and bones. So if, if you've never seen someone fast for 40 days,

369
01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:04.090
40 nights, it is horrendous. What happens to them? You have an image of someone in a concentration

370
01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:14.989
camp. That's what it looks like. That, that kind of deprivation where you're only drinking water and

371
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.709
no food, that's what it looks like.

372
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:25.080
And so when you picture Elijah in this moment, I don't want you to picture him healthy, looking

373
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:30.800
strong and vibrant. I don't want you to think of him as someone who hasn't come out of something.

374
01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:35.169
He's come out of something and now he's just coming out of something else. And this thing that he's

375
01:05:35.179 --> 01:05:40.649
just come out of is worse than the first thing. And, and sometimes what we fail to understand is

376
01:05:40.659 --> 01:05:47.129
that the journey that we're on, we imagine that when God is with us, that that things are just going

377
01:05:47.139 --> 01:05:53.520
to automatically get better. And I want you to know that, that, that strategically and in terms of

378
01:05:53.530 --> 01:06:02.689
what we see in the scriptures before we have our breakthroughs, we go through what is clearly an

379
01:06:02.699 --> 01:06:12.800
extreme type of burnout that before we can have that mountain top experience again where God is

380
01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:19.739
leading Elijah to, I want you to know that you're going to go through a lot more difficulty before

381
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:28.899
you actually experience that. But here's the good news is that when he comes to the cave where he

382
01:06:28.909 --> 01:06:38.340
spends the night, God then gives him instructions to stand up. And I want you to imagine how weak he

383
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:45.699
must have been. Here's a guy that up until now, all he wants to do is lie down and sleep. Here's a

384
01:06:45.709 --> 01:06:52.219
guy that all he wanted to do was just simply die. And, and not only that, but for the last 40 days,

385
01:06:52.820 --> 01:07:00.120
he has been going without any food and just a little bit of water and it somehow has sustained him

386
01:07:00.129 --> 01:07:06.620
to the, to the point where he may not have even had any water. We don't even know if he had any for

387
01:07:06.629 --> 01:07:13.310
the journey. It, it seems like the angel provided everything that he needed before he went on the

388
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:21.669
journey. And what we know is that scientifically, you cannot go three days without water because

389
01:07:21.679 --> 01:07:29.860
we're mainly water. Our, our physical composition is mainly water. And so if you don't have water

390
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:40.120
beyond three days, you die. And so I believe that God is somehow miraculously sustaining and

391
01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:46.449
preventing Elijah's death all the way till he gets to the mouth of the cave. And then when he gets

392
01:07:46.459 --> 01:07:53.439
there, can you just imagine the collapse that is just in his mind and in his body, how he felt

393
01:07:53.449 --> 01:07:58.790
emotionally and spiritually completely drained and then he gets one more instruction and this

394
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:08.659
instruction is for him to stand in the mouth of the cave. And, and what he's being asked to do here

395
01:08:09.399 --> 01:08:16.669
is he's being asked to stand in the presence of the Lord. I, you know, when someone is seating and

396
01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:26.120
is seated, excuse me. And, and um, it's like almost disrespectful, you know, in, in, in specific

397
01:08:26.129 --> 01:08:33.609
moments and, and sometimes to show honor, we, we stand up when someone walks over to us, we don't

398
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:39.740
stay seated because it's disrespectful to stay seated when someone is standing. So you stand and

399
01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:48.080
then you invite the person to sit with you because you're equals because you want relationship

400
01:08:48.849 --> 01:08:56.350
because you want to look into another person's eyes. It's because you want to tell them that you're

401
01:08:56.359 --> 01:09:04.758
the same. And, and what, what God does is that he tells Elijah a person who only wants to lie down

402
01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:13.399
and only wants to sleep, that he's now going to have a personal encounter with him and what he wants

403
01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:20.119
to do. And this is such a beautiful moment is tell Elijah, Elijah, I don't want you to be on the

404
01:09:20.128 --> 01:09:30.298
ground. Like when I sent my angel to feed you and to give you something to drink, I want you to

405
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:43.409
stand up so I can deal with you face to face. So when I walk by you, you can sense

406
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.290
and you can see my presence

407
01:09:53.169 --> 01:09:59.500
because this is what the Lord says. I want you to go out and I want you to stand on the mountain in

408
01:09:59.509 --> 01:10:06.879
the presence of the Lord. For the Lord is about to pass by and then a great and powerful wind just

409
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:15.390
tore the mountains apart and, and, and shattered the rocks before the Lord. But the Lord was not in

410
01:10:15.399 --> 01:10:23.000
the wind. And then after the wind, there was an earthquake but but the Lord wasn't in the earthquake

411
01:10:24.509 --> 01:10:29.080
and after the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord just wasn't in the fire.

412
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:37.229
And then after the fire came a gentle whisper, can we say amen to that?

413
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:45.330
And, and, and I've often reflected on this passage, but I feel like I just, you know, sometimes you

414
01:10:45.339 --> 01:10:50.339
understand things a little more differently and sometimes a little deeper. And um

415
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.870
and I feel like in the story that we're in that God knew exactly what Elijah needed

416
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.450
and he had already experienced the fire, you know,

417
01:11:04.399 --> 01:11:06.770
and it's not what Elijah needed again.

418
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.310
Like he knows exactly what it is that you need in the moment that you need it.

419
01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:22.859
And he may have shown up and revealed himself by fire. But, but he knows that in the moment that he

420
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:28.080
revealed himself by fire was because you needed that fire. That was what you needed for the moment

421
01:11:28.089 --> 01:11:32.740
that you were in. And so can you trust God for every moment that you're in that he's going to reveal

422
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.700
himself the way that you need him

423
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:44.700
you see, he knew exactly what Elijah needed. The second thing is that God reveals his tender nature

424
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:52.120
because up until now, Elijah doesn't even know that God can be tender. We learn about God's

425
01:11:52.129 --> 01:11:58.959
tenderness because of Elijah's Brokenness because of his burnout. We get to discover what it looks

426
01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:05.229
like to be in a relationship with a tender God. We don't have to worry about the wind and the

427
01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.790
earthquake and the fire because God is able to come to us in a gentle whisper. And, and if you're

428
01:12:11.799 --> 01:12:16.180
looking for healing in your life, that's important, right? Like you don't need someone aggressive in

429
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:21.890
your life, telling you all the things that you've done wrong. I mean, you know what you've done

430
01:12:21.899 --> 01:12:26.970
wrong. There's no one harder on yourself than you. That's why you're gonna burn out for goodness

431
01:12:26.979 --> 01:12:33.399
sake. You don't need someone to point out what it is that you need to do different. You know,

432
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.020
everything needs to be different. You just don't even know where to start. So the last thing you

433
01:12:37.029 --> 01:12:45.419
need is instruction in how to do life better. You don't need the steps. Now, what you need is

434
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:53.870
tenderness. You need the gentle whisper of God. And that's what God reveals to Elijah is that God is

435
01:12:53.879 --> 01:13:02.959
able to speak to us with a gentle whisper. When everybody else is shouting, God is whispering

436
01:13:06.089 --> 01:13:15.520
and let me ask you to consider this. If you feel that God is shouting at you in your moment of

437
01:13:15.529 --> 01:13:21.759
burnout and Brokenness. I want you to know that the person who's shouting is Satan. It isn't God

438
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:29.160
because when we are burnt out and broken and we need healing and we need to be restored and we need

439
01:13:29.169 --> 01:13:34.240
to be made. Well, because of the scriptures, we can rely on this wisdom and this truth and this

440
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:39.120
principle. And I want you to know that God in that moment isn't going to shout. He's going to

441
01:13:39.129 --> 01:13:39.819
whisper

442
01:13:41.899 --> 01:13:48.859
and that's how you're going to know. That's God and not anyone else other than Him. And God's not

443
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:55.000
gonna ask you to lay on the ground and keep trying to die. He's going to tell you to stand up

444
01:13:55.009 --> 01:14:03.080
because He wants to look you in the eye and tenderly bring you back to a place of healing and

445
01:14:03.089 --> 01:14:03.870
restoration.

446
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:08.490
That's where we're going to find God's presence

447
01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:16.910
is standing up before Him and everywhere in the scriptures. What's amazing is that people always had

448
01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:25.009
to literally just bow before God like no one could stand in His presence like it was, it was just a

449
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:31.490
thing you, how do you stand in the presence of glory? You just can't. And yet God is saying in the

450
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:41.979
presence of my glory, I want you to stand. That's how much He loves you. And Jesus said this in John

451
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:47.830
15 15. He said I no longer call you servants. I call you friends

452
01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.830
today. Know this, you are a friend of God.

453
01:14:57.229 --> 01:15:08.200
And in Jesus, we have a friend who sticks closer that any brother and in Matthew 11, look at what it

454
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:15.580
says from the version of the message it says, are you tired? Are you worn out?

455
01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:27.200
Are you burnt out on religion? And Jesus says, come to me, get away with me and you'll recover your

456
01:15:27.209 --> 01:15:40.040
life. I'll show you how to take a real rest, walk with me and work with me. Watch how I do it. Learn

457
01:15:40.049 --> 01:15:49.149
the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill fitting on. You, keep company with

458
01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:56.939
me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

459
01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:11.089
And now I'm gonna ask you to stand and now you know what that means, it's enough sitting.

460
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:22.209
Hey, I hope uh as heavy as this message was, I hope you feel uplifted at the end of it and, and that

461
01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:28.000
you feel like you've gotten some, some, some good words of wisdom from the Lord and uh to guide you

462
01:16:28.009 --> 01:16:35.779
in the next steps of your journey. Um Spending time with God is simply just asking him to come into

463
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:40.439
your life. And if you've never done that, it's the best decision I've ever made in my life. And I'll

464
01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:41.870
never look back from that as the,

465
01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:49.109
it is the most powerful and most meaningful day of my existence.

466
01:16:52.299 --> 01:16:58.419
And the beautiful thing about, you know, inviting Jesus into our life. It's, it's, it's about saying,

467
01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:02.589
you know, I, I'm not going to do this life without you. That's what it means.

468
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:14.379
And so if you're ready to say that face to face with God in his presence, as he just, you know,

469
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:17.729
makes his way across your presence,

470
01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.069
how about you? Just let him know

471
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:26.240
you want them in your life like never before

472
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.649
can we do that together?

473
01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:38.689
And so father, as you walk by us, as we get to call you daddy,

474
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:53.500
as we acknowledge and recognize that you're so much more for us than just a savior of sin. But you

475
01:17:53.509 --> 01:17:56.390
are the savior of our life.

476
01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:03.819
And I just pray that as you walk by us, that we would experience your presence like never before.

477
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:12.919
And so we invite you into our life and we ask you to lead us so we can learn from you, so we can

478
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:23.870
practice your presence and experience the power of what it means to be sons and daughters of the

479
01:18:23.879 --> 01:18:29.799
almighty king. All that you have at your disposal

480
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:34.319
is at our availability.

481
01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:46.689
You give it to us as an inheritance. And today we claim that we received that and we walk in the

482
01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:59.029
faith of the promise of that. And we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thanks guys. God

483
01:18:59.040 --> 01:18:59.649
bless you.

484
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:08.089
We're just gonna wrap up this gathering with another song. It's called Holy Spirit. I think it's a

485
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:13.490
beautiful song that I think is gonna remind us of the presence of God and, and then uh Johan is

486
01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:19.229
gonna come out and say something funny. So laugh and um, and I know it's gonna be natural when you

487
01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.029
do. And then we got an after party hanging out and I, I get, I look forward to getting to say hi to

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.189
you and to meet with you. And um, and thank you for just being a part of this gathering. Don't

The song is about the Holy Spirit and to invite him into our life.

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:43.049

521
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:49.310
taking back your kid after church services and leaving them a night there, it's really bad for their

522
01:25:49.319 --> 01:25:56.180
health and mental health as well. So please take them back. We don't want to demonstrate that here.

523

532
01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:00.500
good impact on my accent, so I'll keep doing that. But there's, my mind is like running on steroid
