WEBVTT

1
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:40.090
recognize who he is and what he has done, but also what he is about to do in our lives today, we're

2
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.770
gonna worship together and we're gonna hear a wonderful message from Pastor Yvonne called

3
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:53.810
"Reposition to Rise" and it's gonna be a message that I know is going to deeply impact our lives.

4
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.300
We also want you to know that this is a place where you can come in as you are and just allow

5
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.840
yourself to be welcomed by the ever welcoming presence of Jesus, Let him do the work in your life,

6
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:17.380
no one is going to tell you what you need to change more than the Holy Spirit can do so much better

7
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:24.510
than any person. And he is going to just speak directly to that area of your life that you know, God

8
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:33.530
is telling you directly specifically uniquely that this is the place in your life that he needs to

9
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:40.850
have access to and that will be up to us to surrender ourselves to offer up our life to him in that

10
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.560
area of our life that we've been somehow and for whatever reason, holding back well this is not a

11
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.030
time to hold back any longer, this is a time to just be relaxed in his presence, to be free in his

12
00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:01.650
presence to let him have access in our presence and each of us, I know God can work deeply for us

13
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:08.050
and within us. So right now we're gonna pray and we're gonna begin to worship God together. We've

14
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:15.500
got a wonderful worship set that our team has put together for us and each song is going to speak to

15
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:22.300
us about something different and I pray that something in what we will sing today will speak to you

16
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:28.040
in a very unique and powerful way. And so father, we thank you for welcoming us into your presence

17
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.190
for the way that you receive us, the way we are. But you lead us to a place of change and

18
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:41.260
transformation. I thank you for all that you have done for us and all that you desire to do for the

19
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:48.400
way that you are helping us to reach the next levels, not only in our lives spiritually but also

20
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:56.420
relational e and professionally, the Lord, you are always moving us forward and when we see

21
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:04.650
ourselves regressing you speak to us about how we need to let go of something that is anchoring us

22
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:13.300
or dragging us away from your purpose and for the outcome that you have for us today we surrender to

23
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.390
you Lord and we thank you for all that you're going to reveal through the worship and through the

24
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:26.290
message and all that you have in store for the days and weeks to come. We ask these things in Jesus

25
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:31.990
name, Amen Amen, let's worship together, Would you welcome the worship team as they lead us?

26
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:41.970
We're gonna get going and clap our hands, we're gonna sing, I know who I am so that we are declaring

27
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.870
that we know who we are in Christ, Jesus and no, why

28
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.170

from your hearts, everyone

79
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:37.180
Wow, thank you worship team that was amazing, we really appreciate you so much for what you do week

80
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:44.270
after week and uh I'm really glad to be back with you wanna thank Yohan for speaking last Sunday.

81
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:51.440
If you were here, would you give it up to Yohan for the message that he gave on renewal and for our

82
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.110
thanksgiving Sunday. And we just want to thank our community kitchen team that did such a phenomenal

83
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:03.090
job of preparing that hot meal and serving that and 110 meals were served that day. Can we

84
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.040
give it up for the community kitchen team

85
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:15.490
and we are so blessed to have that team together and they're going to just do the monthly events

86
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:20.490
till the end of the year and then we're gonna start to see if we can increase that in the new year.

87
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:27.090
And so the next one is going to be again in November. So mid November, I think it's the 13th. Um,

88
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:33.520
but we'll be announcing that in the next few weeks, uh just to remind everyone that will be doing

89
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:40.140
another community kitchen food distribution as well as clothing and any other items that would be of

90
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:45.880
helping a benefit to those in our community and those that would be visiting our community. We also

91
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.960
want to make you aware of a worship night that we have been planning, it's called unite the church

92
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.980
and we want to thank our young adult ministry here at River's Edge for putting this together and for

93
00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:03.580
collaborating with other churches where they're going to be providing musicians as well and it'll be

94
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:10.820
an opportunity for us to gather as a church. And so it isn't, uh, just for young adults, it's open

95
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:17.180
to everyone and we want to encourage you to come out for this event that's coming up in November and

96
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:25.630
it's called, unite the church worship night. We also want to encourage you to think about how we can

97
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:32.620
get involved here at River's Edge and we have so many wonderful community groups that are already

98
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.920
meeting and some of them are meeting here at the church, others are meeting in homes. And if you

99
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:44.410
haven't found a community that you would like to be a part of this might be an incredible way for

100
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:51.010
you to do that in one of our belong groups. And so a lot of people are already in a group and they

101
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.450
are loving it. And sometimes it's just you got to get past yourself past some of that awkwardness

102
00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:03.220
that we sometimes feel, sometimes we're worried about not knowing people and not sure if we're going

103
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:10.030
to fit in with the group that were assigned to or may be encouraged to attend. But I want you to

104
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.710
know that if the group isn't right for you, there's nothing that obligates you to keep going to it.

105
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:21.570
It's just something that you feel when you walk in, if this is right for you or not and you'll never

106
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:27.820
know if you don't take that step. And what I've seen from so many people is that once they've gone,

107
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:32.430
they've immediately fallen in love with the group that they're a part of. And so groups are meeting

108
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:38.040
online in person and even here at the church. And so if you want to know more than just email us at

109
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:44.650
belong groups and we will get back to you and assign you to a group. The other announcement I have

110
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:50.650
for you is with regards to giving and we have four ways that you can do that. So pick the one that

111
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:56.670
is the best option for you. Thank you for doing that today, even in person and for those of you that

112
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:03.300
are online for the method that you choose and for supporting us. And it's unfortunate that we have

113
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:10.540
so many people still Watching us online. I want this place full. Um, when we look at the numbers

114
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:17.310
week to week, we still have about 385 people on average that watches online. Isen't that terrible.

115
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:27.210
It's terrible. I don't want to shut it down because we have so many people watching. But what's

116
00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:33.400
what's terrible is that it's gotten so easy and so comfortable to just stay home uh that people

117
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:40.240
don't come out and and I don't know what to do. I mean this like really weird space where I want to

118
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.890
shut it down, but then I don't want to affect the people that are watching. I surely don't want to

119
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:50.150
shut it down. People who are watching from other places in the world, but you know locally that the

120
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:57.190
our largest numbers are local and so I I don't know what to do. So pray for me. I don't know what to

121
00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:02.180
do to get people to come back, but I'm thankful you're still there watching online. You're probably

122
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:09.070
already just like, like just like whatever got rid of me right now for saying that you just okay,

123
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:16.400
bye see you. Um, but the after party is something that we love to do each week. And I want to thank

124
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:23.340
Richard and the team where every Sunday they are on and on point and just like creating such a

125
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:28.880
welcome environment and community of faith for us. Um, it's just so great

126
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:39.440
and it's a great way to meet people and, and, and create friendships. And just a few weeks ago we

127
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.090
had one of our uh, you know, cafe team members. Farah moved back to California. And so far if you're

128
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:51.200
watching, we just want to say we love you were praying for you and we want you to know that we will

129
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:58.790
continue to support you in prayer. And, and it's just wonderful how we never would have really

130
00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:04.920
gotten to know Farrah had she not made a decision to also step out and get involved and and attend a

131
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:12.810
small group and join a survey team. And so now she's um, in California. And so we want to pray

132
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:17.250
blessings upon her life. We had hoped to have had the opportunity to pray with her before she left.

133
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:21.800
We didn't get that. So we're just gonna mention it right here right now. And the other thing I'd

134
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:28.300
like to make known to you is that we have a great kids program that we've been working on and

135
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:34.370
relaunching and improving week to week. And that is made possible by the volunteers. And so if you'd

136
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:41.580
like to volunteer in a ministry, then consider ministry for a kid. And we have also a youth ministry

137
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:47.220
that happens right now twice a month. And we're looking to increase that as we increase our

138
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.890
volunteers. So we'd like to go from twice a month to every week. So before we dismiss the kids,

139
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:59.360
let's just watch this video and then kids are gonna be dismissed as we would take the time for me to

140
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.850
introduce to you our speaker for today. Pastor Yvonne.

141
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.750
Alright, so kids, you're dismissed. Thank you so much. There's no youth today. It'll be on next

142
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:50.990
Sunday. And I just wanted to give you a quick recap of my time away. I was with um, the church in

143
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.620
Los Angeles called Mosaic that we are a part of and I was able to meet with the pastors there and

144
00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:04.750
take in a conference with them. It was such an inspiring and meaningful and powerful time of

145
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:11.370
connecting. I want to thank, um, you know, Peter and Brian who also came with me Brian and Peter

146
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:17.910
were great guys to have on the trip. And Peter made it possible for us to fly down and

147
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.590
accompanied us and we all received something so meaningful, so powerful out of that experience. And,

148
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:29.140
and I hope that in the future we'll be able to increase our numbers and be able to go down and

149
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:35.210
experience that together and to also have them come up and I think in the next little while we're

150
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:41.910
gonna be having the pastors from these different communities of faith, whether they be in Mexico or

151
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:49.420
Ecuador or Los Angeles, um, and others like Malaysia, they're gonna come here and and speak and so

152
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.640
it'll be an opportunity for us to get to know this community of faith that this tribe that we are a

153
00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.770
part of and to hear from those pastors and to have them come and minister to us. And so I'm looking

154
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:06.690
forward to that as well. Aren't you excited that that's gonna be part of our reality and part of our

155
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:07.630
experience?

156
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:17.870
They're amazing communicators of God's word, they are anointed. And there got a special way of just

157
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:26.840
bringing forth uh insights into his beautiful story that can really impact our lives. And so today

158
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:34.180
we have Pastor Yvonne who was with us for so many years, has now transitioned to South Africa but

159
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:41.350
comes back um every six months or so does ministry here in the city and has been quite active during

160
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:49.290
her time here in Montreal and today we are privileged to be able to have her speak on reposition

161
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:55.660
this reposition to rise is the theme. And so would you welcome pastor even as she speaks today,

162
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:26.290
so much part of my life for forever. I found in the River's Edge was part of my story, I grew up

163
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:30.920
here like emotionally and spiritually and I've been given the opportunity to really step into my

164
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:38.430
purpose on this platform. So I'm coming back from Cape Town, South Africa and when they introduced

165
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:45.180
me in South Africa, they tell me that I'm a global speaker from Canada. So, so so when I'm here in,

166
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:51.360
in, in years, so Lorenzo will say I'm from South Africa. So I had a bit of a identity crisis, you

167
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.250
know when I whether I'm here or there, but I think God is okay with me with that. I'm still, I'm

168
00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.660
still dealing with that in my life. But you know, one thing I want to say to you this morning is

169
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:07.020
that it's always an honor for me to share God's word and so with this in South Africa, with its in

170
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:13.460
Canada, with it in England, I'm privileged and honored to be able to be his vessel And today this is

171
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:18.690
my heart, I'm going to speak to you heart to heart. I'm not going to speak too much to your head,

172
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:24.500
but I really want to speak to your heart because I believe that we are in a season where God is

173
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:30.070
putting his finger on his people and I want to bring greetings from South Africa, from Cape Town.

174
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:35.620
I have a beautiful picture for you from Cape Town. I thought I'll give you a little taste because the

175
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:42.100
idea is that next year you will be coming to South Africa in April 2023? I'm inviting all of you

176
00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:47.950
so to come and we're gonna have a conference there and just enjoy Cape Town. So there you go, you

177
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:53.460
will have those beaches, you will have mountains and you will have the best food ever. Is that a

178
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.120
good deal?

179
00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:05.790
Yeah. And I've been helping church in Cape Town and they did tell me that I'm gonna send their love

180
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:12.610
and greetings to you. So today, I'm gonna not take a lot of time with other stuff. I just want to go

181
00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:18.390
directly into the word of the Lord and you know, we are in the series. So I'm fitting myself into

182
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:24.960
the new series that you have called Fresh Start and I find that it's such an appropriate theme for

183
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.790
what I believe God has placed on my heart all year. Actually, I've been for a year in undercover. I

184
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:35.270
feel like I've been like Moses where God sometimes take us out of public space and it just sort of

185
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.810
resets us or he will do some excavation work on your heart and your mind because he wants to

186
00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:46.530
reposition you so that you can actually come forth uh to a different space with him and about

187
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:53.210
yourself and also the work that God has for us. So I think that is a good theme for me. And so what

188
00:36:53.210 --> 00:37:01.710
I want you to think about before I even go into my message is um do you have a vision of your fresh

189
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:08.840
start? Like, do you know where you want to go? Do you have an image, like a visual image of what a

190
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:14.960
fresh start for you would look like, and I want you to hold that image in your mind and in your

191
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:22.020
heart, because this is this is what it's all about, because I don't think we can speak in a vacuum.

192
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:28.470
I don't think I can motivate you and help you put you on a path without you knowing where you're

193
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:34.240
going? I think we all need that. Am I right? You can speak to me? Yeah. Yes. So we all need that. So,

194
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.400
I would like, because I've been listening to a few messages on Fresh Start and I found it has

195
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.670
been very deep and powerful and I I'm gonna revisit all of that because I believe that each message

196
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:50.950
actually builds on the other. So, a fresh start for me is always you are starting over, you're

197
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:57.350
beginning, but it's on the next level. Okay, so you're not starting from scratch everything that

198
00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.560
you've gone through everything that you've experienced, whether it's the blessings or the pain or

199
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:07.890
the confusion, they all packaged together and God can mix it into something beautiful to push you to

200
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:14.120
another level. And so within the disappointment, within the pain, there are seeds to your destiny,

201
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:22.120
okay, there ceased your future. And so I am excited because I speak this from my own heart. I know

202
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.900
that, you know, for me, I'm going to speak a little bit about my story? Not too much, but just to

203
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:32.610
make some of the points. But I am in the season now where I had to identify like a year and a half

204
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:39.880
ago is God. I need you to reposition me. I've exhausted a level with him and I just needed to know

205
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:44.430
God, what are you doing with me? I need you to speak to me. I don't want to just go forth and do my

206
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:50.490
stuff and just speak to people like from my head, I want my heart to be engaged. I want to know that

207
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:55.610
you love me at a deeper level. I want to know that you have purpose for me and I need to understand

208
00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:00.410
that, speak to me, Jesus. You know, those are the kind of conversations I had this last year and

209
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:05.660
it's been one of my most difficult seasons, I would say, absolute date. Uh, no. Lorenzo asked me,

210
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:10.520
how was a year, Like last year? It was, it was I know my family is most probably watching me, but it

211
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:17.560
was painful. It was it was really hard because I've been taken out from a space that was comfortable

212
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:24.400
and then put into a place of origin and I needed to revisit my story, my roots. And then I asked

213
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.400
myself in the presence of Jesus, who am I? If I take off all my labels, all my titles, all my

214
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:38.320
experiences. Am I comfortable with myself and am I still on the path that God asked for me? Or am I

215
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.430
holding onto something like an old song in the cold season? And God is pushing me to a new season.

216
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:51.030
And so those are things that I have for us. So I'm gonna start with a beautiful story that I want to

217
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.970
that I want to, you can, you can accompany, you know, he's, he's my, he's gonna help me today. So

218
00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:00.830
I'm blessed always to have musicians. Can we just support dearly beloved?

219
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.700
And so there's a beautiful story in the book of John chapter 21. And I want to ask you even as you

220
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.950
turn and as you put it on the screens

221
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:23.250
that you would ask God in this moment that he would open your heart to receive what he has to say

222
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:33.570
and that you would expand your capacity to receive. Because when we have closed hearts and when we

223
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:39.470
have limited capacity, even if God wants to pour great things into us. If I only have a little cup

224
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:45.300
and he has a whole gallon of oil that he wants to give to me, I cannot hold it. So may God enlarge

225
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:51.940
our capacity to receive from him. And may he open May you open your hearts to God, I don't want to

226
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:59.270
listen to a person, but I want to listen to you this morning? I want you to speak to me because I

227
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:04.200
believe that God has placed each one of us so the message is not just for you as a, as a corporate,

228
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:09.570
it is for us as a corporate body, but it's also custom made for you personally and this is the

229
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:15.040
beauty that Jesus can do, you can translate a message and it can speak to you and it has words

230
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.560
exactly just for you,

231
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:31.550
so God, I give you this time, we love you, we honor you were hungry for you speak clearly beyond my

232
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:37.380
words, in the name of the father, in the name of Jesus, in the name of Holy Spirit and all the

233
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:46.400
people says amen. John 21 it's a familiar story, but I want to just use a story to illustrate what I

234
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.830
would like to say. Now later, now the issue here, the portrait here is that the disciples follow,

235
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:58.420
Jesus, Jesus died, they don't understand what is happening and now they are confused, despondent and

236
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.190
Peter says, I'm going back to where I, what I'm familiar with, I'm gonna go back fishing and so

237
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:08.100
later Jesus appeared again to disciples beside the sea of Galilee and this is how it happens,

238
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:17.380
I think okay, let me read my, I think the versus several of the disciples were there, Simon, Peter,

239
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:23.410
Thomas, Nathaniel from Cana and all of them and to the other disciples, Simon Peter and he said I'm gonna

240
00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:30.000
go fishing. So they said okay we all come. So they all went into the boat but they caught nothing

241
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.400
all night and these are these are professional fishermen, they toil all night and they didn't catch

242
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:40.720
anything and then someone appears on the beach like you saw the Cape Town beach, that's why I showed

243
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:49.320
you that beach picture and then someone appears and he says guys did you have anything? Um and he

244
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.360
said well come just I think it's over there, well come to the all said so they went out into the

245
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.700
boat but they caught nothing all night, I don't, Jesus was standing on the beach but disciples

246
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:04.600
couldn't see who he was and he called out, he says fellows have you caught any fish? And they

247
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:05.380
replied

248
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:13.920
no and Jesus now says and this is the key word, he says throw your nets on the other side on the

249
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.590
right side, gives him specific instructions. Now he says I want you to shift your position, I want

250
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:24.100
you to throw it on the other side and then we'll get some and so they did that and they couldn't

251
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.960
haul in the net because there were so many fish and so that was where the harvest was. Then the

252
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.590
disciples whom Jesus loved said to Peter it is the Lord and when Simon Peter heard that it was the

253
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:42.390
lord, he jumped, put on his studio and he jumped into the water and headed to the shore, the other

254
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:47.460
stayed with the boat and pulled in the load to the net for they were only about 100 yards from the

255
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:54.090
show when they got there they found breakfast on the beach with Jesus fishing, cooking over a

256
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.760
charcoal fire and some bread and I'm just gonna end there and then he said you know bring some of

257
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:06.250
the fish uh today had to retreat a couple of weeks ago and I was telling the ladies that there's

258
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.740
there's a feminine and nurturing part of Jesus. I like the fact that he can make us be, you know,

259
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:18.380
breakfast on the beach and that is fish and so he comes and he tells them that I know that you're

260
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:24.610
struggling and so my point is I'm just speak today about repositioned to rise, Jesus had to

261
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:30.240
challenge them to reposition themselves and it was when they repositioned themselves they were able

262
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:36.950
to get the harvest and so this is just really like I want to use it as a backdrop. But sometimes you

263
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:43.920
know we do things the same old way and we skill people, we have capacity, those people, those guys

264
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.790
were like capacity like high capacity people but they couldn't have the fruit and the harvest that

265
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:55.480
they needed until they met Jesus and Jesus saw them, I just need you to shift and go to another side

266
00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:01.860
and to go into a deeper place because that is where your harvest is. And so today I just want us to

267
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:09.920
think about how and what do we need to reposition so that we can harvest the new that God has for us

268
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:15.850
so that we can step into the fresh start that he has for us because we all know that we can go into

269
00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:23.260
a new story or a new chapter with the old narrative, we can go into a new future with mind sets and

270
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:29.070
belief systems and behavior patterns or hearts that are hardened and still stuck in the old story.

271
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.610
And so this is a little bit what we talked about that the fresh start needs to look at what happened

272
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:40.980
before before we can go forward. And so I'm presuming that as you, as you tracked with the messages,

273
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:48.350
you have now already understood that you need to put something in your heart, a way that is blocking

274
00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:55.810
you the pain, the hurt and to revisit that because you need closure and until we find closure for

275
00:45:55.810 --> 00:46:02.120
emotional pain for our wounded Nous, we cannot move into the new And so I'm going to do a lot of the

276
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.690
psychological stuff. I think I was quite impressed already with the speaker. You did a good job last

277
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.920
week and Lorenza spoke about reparation work, but I just want to touch on it just from just to make

278
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.990
my point here is that when we reposition ourselves, because I'm going to talk about number one, we

279
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:24.160
need to reposition the way we think and our mindsets are connected to our hearts because when my,

280
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:29.680
when I'm hurt, my thinking patterns are connected to the pain that I've experienced, it doesn't have

281
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.910
to be just pain because someone betrayed you or someone left you or someone abandoned you, but it

282
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:39.630
can just be pain of lost dreams of things that didn't work out of regret of all those things that

283
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:44.890
happened to us in our story that we just say God I did know, what are you doing with me? But this

284
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:50.060
doesn't really find or feel good. Like the disciples, I was trying to put myself in their shoes, is

285
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:54.790
that most people felt that they were scammed, Jesus said, okay, follow me and they gave up

286
00:46:54.790 --> 00:47:00.550
everything and now he dies and it looks like the story doesn't look that good until Jesus had to

287
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:06.540
come and reveal himself to them. And this is what I love about Jesus when I was reading it again,

288
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:13.840
that he has a tender heart and he has strength and courage and tenderness. So, wherever you are

289
00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.700
right now today, in your story, I want to invite you into a space where you can have a conversation

290
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:27.340
with him as honest as you can because Jesus is now coming to your heart's today to say, I want you

291
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:33.580
to reposition yourself, I want you to take yourself out of an old story and I want to take yourself

292
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:39.740
out of an old mindset and I want to embrace something new that I have because the results that I

293
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:47.920
have for you are different than your current are you with me? So the next level that you're going to,

294
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:54.260
what however you want to call your next level, your fresh start requires a new version of who you

295
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:54.960
are.

296
00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:05.310
Sometimes the very things I realize that I'm looking for is also looking for me, but not for the for

297
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:10.200
the version that I am right now, I can handle some of the stuff. And so I had to realize and I said,

298
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:19.930
God shift me, restore me, restore me, revive me, make me a new so that I can receive what you have

299
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:27.730
for me because often, and this is where I really want to encourage you that stay and stay and don't

300
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:35.750
give up. But be intentional and be deliberate and be very courageous to press in. I'm just here this

301
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:40.590
morning because I know that I'm gonna be I'm leaving in two weeks so I can say basically what I want

302
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:49.840
to say, right? So I want to bless like my heart and I was saying to God, I love God's people love

303
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:57.220
this community of faith. My desire, my prayer is for us to rise to new levels of influence and

304
00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:04.290
impact. But the blueprint that Jesus showed me over this last year was you cannot go high if you

305
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:09.430
haven't looked at restoration and if you haven't repositioned yourselves and then you can rise, We

306
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:15.490
don't jump seasons. So please understand the season that you are in. Because the season that you are

307
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:23.630
in will equal the training that you need. I felt this last year that I knew the guy was training me

308
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:28.960
something for something different, but it was painful because I had to just be intentional in my

309
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:34.860
prayer life, I said, God put new fire on my prayer altar and give me a new hunger for your word. And

310
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:39.710
I believe those are key things that we need to reposition in. But that's just what I that's my

311
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:48.350
backdrop. So, life beliefs are, life beliefs and ... You can just dance with me here because

312
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:55.150
I'm going a little bit jumpy. Our limited beliefs sabotage our success and our liberating beliefs,

313
00:49:55.160 --> 00:50:02.030
liberate and position us for the next. And I know that you had I think Lorenzo spoke I think earlier

314
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.780
about belief. So I'm not gonna massage that too much. And he spoke about Moses you know, like we're

315
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.820
reluctant. I'm like a reluctant leader too. And God gives me something. I said no, I don't want to

316
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:15.280
do and let someone else do it until it shakes you and said no, you have to take your place and

317
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.620
confront the beliefs that keep us stuck. So I just want us to really for this part for my story

318
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:27.550
today is understand your belief system. Write it down in your journal, write it down on your phone.

319
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.400
What are the, what are the beliefs that you have that is keeping you stuck? Because it's those

320
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:39.020
belief systems and it's those patterns, thinking patterns that will sabotage your future. Am I right?

321
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:46.330
You can say hi or no, because I don't see eyes, but I'd like to just say yes or no. Yeah, it keeps

322
00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:53.210
us and and and so what, what my limiting belief is not yours. Remember when God was challenging me

323
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:59.330
to do like a project that I'm working on and I said, no, I don't want to do that, like who am I? You know?

324
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:05.180
And I was catching myself saying the same thing that I was teaching. And so when God takes you to

325
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:10.840
another level, you're going to feel like you cannot do it. But that's the tension that is beautiful,

326
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:16.420
that we need to live in that tension. We need to live in the tension where we feel like, yes, I can

327
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:22.490
do and change the world. But God, I'm also afraid I have so much faith, but I fear I didn't know

328
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:26.880
those two things could exist. But this is the beauty of this new journey that God is taking us to.

329
00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:33.460
We need to live in the tension. And so today with your heart is saying, you know, I cannot do this,

330
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:39.560
I cannot start my business. I cannot I cannot be a speaker, a preacher or I cannot leave Montreal

331
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:45.820
and go to another country? Go to south africa? Yes, God is going to be with because what are we

332
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:54.470
gonna experience is that we're going to find God in the middle of the tension. And so I I want us to

333
00:51:54.470 --> 00:52:01.610
understand really today that when our thinking patterns are not aligned and sponsored by the God of

334
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:09.100
the universe, we're living and serving something other than God Romans. Chapter 12: verses one and 2

335
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:09.780
it says.

336
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:17.800
And so dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because all of this

337
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:25.770
has done for what he has done for us. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice, the kind that he will

338
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:32.130
find acceptable because this truly is your worship. Isn't it amazing when you commit yourself fully

339
00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:37.960
to God and surrender to him. That's your worship. That's what he wants. So we continue to worship,

340
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:43.300
we just don't stop when we sing songs, don't copy the behavior and the customs of this world. But

341
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:53.020
let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn and know

342
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:58.970
remember it's when he changes the way we think then we will learn and know God's will for you which

343
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:09.160
is good and pleasing and perfect. I love that because God's will is pleasing and perfect. It's not

344
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.080
like like horrible and then we go through pain but it's there's something life giving. There's

345
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:20.270
something beautiful beautiful about us just honoring him and being represent being an ambassador for

346
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:27.740
God. So your reformation, you're repositioning is What is it about my thinking pattern that I need

347
00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:34.800
to change? What is it that I need to understand that? I don't need to equip myself. What are the new

348
00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:43.170
liberating beliefs that I have that I need to embrace so that I can move forward? So I used the in

349
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:50.180
our teaching. I was saying if you say God, I'm not enough, what is the liberating belief? Anyone

350
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:58.610
I am enough? Okay, so when I say I am enough. So now it's not just saying and so this is where I

351
00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:05.170
have my issue with our world that we live in now because I'm trained as a counselor and I'm also

352
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:11.280
into theology. So I have the merging of the two. What happens in our modern psychology is it says,

353
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.850
OK, hey, just say every day that you're enough, you're enough. You're enough. That's not how it's

354
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:19.660
gonna work. You're not going to be transformed by just shifting and declaring the opposite. You are

355
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:24.930
being transformed by something so much deeper inside of you because you need to listen to yourself.

356
00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:30.880
Where did that belief come from? Maybe your parents told you that your teachers told you that your

357
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:36.140
your oversight people saying you're not enough. So you need to be able to go there? What is the pain?

358
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:41.970
What is the root of that? And then ask God to heal that and then listen to his voice. may we have

359
00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:47.260
eyes and ears eyes to see and ears to hear? What is the truth that is saying to us? So there's a

360
00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:52.890
process. So I just want you like practically to write down a column. These are my limiting beliefs.

361
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:57.630
I'm not enough, where is it coming from? God says that I'm not the tail by the head, he says I'm the

362
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:03.090
beloved. He says I can do all things through Christ Yes, you have all those declarations, but God, I

363
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:10.580
bring you my heart, I bring the soil of my heart to you. I bring my heart to say where are the stony

364
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:16.270
places in my heart that I need to tilt and take away because I don't want it to be hardened because

365
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:21.290
when God comes in and wants to pour out stuff onto you, it becomes hard and can't hold the water

366
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:29.510
cannot seep into those places and so may do that for us today. And so transformation happens and I'm

367
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:33.010
just gonna go a little bit quick with these these things because you can look at on your own

368
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:38.090
transformation in your mental capacity, I believe I want to propose to you today that we are

369
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:48.130
transformed by light and were transformed by love, Light and love The word of God says to me that

370
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:55.480
your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. People who there's one word that I have,

371
00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:00.850
that was my word for 2022 is light. I didn't know that that word was so simple. God gave me that

372
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:06.070
word light and I said what is light? I said God was saying to me this is exactly what you've been

373
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:12.240
asking me for. I want a deeper understanding of kingdom, I wanted a deeper understanding of who God

374
00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:19.920
is and what he's doing and light is understanding. Light is thinking differently. Light is wisdom

375
00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:25.590
understanding. So when light comes, you know when you always says that, may my mind be illuminated.

376
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:32.000
So light for us as we are being transformed is that we need to have superior spiritual intelligence

377
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:37.510
for this world that you're living in. You know, we're living in an age and I heard Lorenzo saying

378
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:41.150
earlier, all these people staying at home, I just want to say to all of you, whether you're

379
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:47.750
listening to me South Africa all over is that it's time for us to come home. Okay, I don't think I

380
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:52.960
don't want to, I said to God, I'm gonna miss a move from God, am I gonna miss what God is doing in

381
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:59.060
the earth and from Africa, I just want to say God is doing something crazy things in Africa. I've

382
00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:05.160
been a student of my, my continent, my soil for the last year and these moves and really beautiful

383
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:11.670
moves, not like really smart, like extra all the things that God is doing and I said God, I want to

384
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:17.780
be part of this. And so there's no place for us to be participants anymore like like this participle

385
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:24.010
taters, I mean you have to be actively if you're a follower of Jesus, I want to invite you people

386
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:32.260
speak to me, you have to take your place, we need your voice, Why am I speaking? This is because the

387
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:37.480
restoration is needed because our voices have been shut down by our own pain and by our own

388
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:43.610
difficulties. We have a mindset that keep us closed down and it's nothing is a mindset that is not

389
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:49.480
in the line with kingdom thinking and so we cannot really fully do already has for us. And so I pray

390
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:55.240
this over this church that God would shift you that God would shift environment that our hearts

391
00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:01.420
would be really a blaze and a flame for God and that we would start there. And so that when we are

392
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:10.250
transformed by light, he says that my word is a lamp unto my faith. So may God give each one of us a

393
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:15.280
deep passion for his word. I've discovered in South Africa, I told all of them, I discovered that

394
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:22.160
they don't, a lot of people don't read the word and so I was telling them and we were talking, I was

395
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.830
talking to this team and I said let's make it a goal this year. God gives you one year to dig,

396
00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:34.220
there's a beautiful story. Give me one year dig my soil. I want to be a student of the word. Read

397
00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:39.730
his word, shut down your social media. Give yourself a plan and say only 30 minutes a day or

398
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:46.900
whatever limit yourself because we cannot you cannot afford to just waste our lives because the city

399
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:55.760
of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the world, waiting for the church after this pandemic. It cannot be the

400
00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:01.350
same people. We have to be repositioned, we're repositioning because we want the fire and the light

401
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:08.130
of God in our hearts so that we can shine forth and so people can come to Jesus. And so this is just

402
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:12.690
an invitation to all those people who feel that they can still sit at home adam, I'm not talking

403
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:16.870
about just coming back to River's Edge. I'm saying go back to any place where you know that you're

404
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:23.030
gonna be a blaze for God, You're not just gonna come in and be like, okay, I'm just gonna gather,

405
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:30.400
speaking to those of you who are seasoned believers. If you are curious about Jesus this morning, I

406
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:37.160
want to invite you into that space that he wants your heart and he wants your voice. And so I just

407
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:43.340
wanted to leave us with that, that God cares about us so deeply that he wants that. And the second

408
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:50.620
part is that we are transformed by love. There's a beautiful verse in Zephaniah 3:17 and we sang

409
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:57.390
beautifully. Zephaniah 3:17 says: "For the Lord, your God is strong and living and is a mighty

410
00:59:57.390 --> 01:00:03.970
savior. He will take delight in you." I want you to eat those words. Eat it into your spirit. Let it

411
01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:10.860
seep into your heart. And any place where that word is not going in, that is a limiting belief. It's

412
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:17.040
a lie. So listen to this, imagine the God of the universe coming into the space individually over

413
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:27.790
all of you saying I am mighty, I take delight in you with gladness, I love you. I sing over you and I want

414
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:35.030
to calm all of your fears. I will rejoice over you. You can't imagine a god who sings over you. What does

415
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:41.970
that feel like? Eh? What does it feel like to know that there's a God of the universe who's strong in

416
01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:46.970
this place right now and he sings over you and he believes and he delights in it. This is our God.

417
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:52.530
This is what he wants to do for you today. This is how he wants to transform your mind so that this

418
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:59.600
mindset, that all the things that came into you that are not from the Lord, he said, I want to

419
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:05.540
sponsor your mindset no longer. Those lies no longer those things that are not true, but and he

420
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.690
loves and I believe that for me that's the most powerful thing and there's so many other words,

421
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:15.350
other verses, but the Bible is full of loving and I think that this is I've discovered in my own

422
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:20.970
life and the life of God's dear people is that we are very low level understanding how to love each

423
01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:26.500
other and how to receive God's love. And so the reason why we talk about the heart is when my

424
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.820
emotions, when I'm frustrated and I'm hurt and angry and bitter, it's hard for me to receive love

425
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:39.430
and so what he's saying today is I want to calm your heart, I want you to know that I care about

426
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:46.890
that and so open your capacity to that. Alright, light, the beauty of God, this truth will disrupt

427
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:52.480
your limiting beliefs and will lead into freedom and into truth. And those are the things that I

428
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.390
just wanted to leave with you that you are being transformed by love and light. And the second part

429
01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:06.460
under reposition is that God wants to expand your capacity capacity is expanded, I said by actually

430
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:13.330
creating attention. So when you are going to do more things that you know that you cannot do in your

431
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:17.810
own strength, you're gonna feel attention, but you're gonna be expanded, you're gonna have more

432
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:24.740
perseverance, more resilience, more, more, more strength to go forward. So capacity building is also

433
01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:32.520
capacity building in our in our, in the spiritual world because when you pray, I know today, a lot

434
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:38.080
of people don't really believe in prayer, but you cannot not believe in prayer and be powerful in

435
01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.810
God's presence and his work. So when it's difficult, all that the only point that I'm going to make

436
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:52.820
under here is that don't give up stand when everything goes wrong in your life and you believed and

437
01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:58.820
you've prayed and said God where are you? Keep standing, keep believing, don't give up, don't give

438
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:04.890
up too soon, he's building capacity whenever, whenever there's something that you don't understand,

439
01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:12.450
keep standing, keep believing, keep hoping, just say God, I believe God understanding, no matter who

440
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:18.300
turns against you, no matter what you cannot understand to stand, don't give up

441
01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:27.880
because God is in your life and is doing something that you will only know maybe two years from now

442
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:33.920
or a year from now is building capacity inside of you and I was saying that I was actually using an

443
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.060
example, I was asked to speak, I didn't speak a lot in in South Africa, but I was asking until the

444
01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:43.540
worship team, I said to them what if God is gonna give you five worship teams, do you have the

445
01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:50.180
capacity to hold it? He said no, so I said, but that is what God would like to do, so why am I being

446
01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:55.610
about expanding and all this stuff is because God wants to do the fresh start, but will we recognize

447
01:03:55.610 --> 01:04:02.710
the fresh start, will we have the capacity to hold it all to steward it when it comes. So this is

448
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:10.100
the season, your season of preparation has to be more than a season of expansion because of harvest,

449
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:16.800
Jesus spent all of his life for only three years. So don't under undermine do not underestimate your

450
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:23.520
season of preparation because God is repositioning is expanding, you is making you into a character

451
01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:28.270
that and stand withstand all the difficulties when people hate you. When people don't love you. When

452
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:33.470
people reject you, when people abandon you, then you can say God, but you with me, you stand and God

453
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:38.590
is always always there with you because he wants to give you because people, I'm gonna go to my last

454
01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:49.580
point and this is a part rise, God is calling all of us to rise and shine. I believe I can use that

455
01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:57.810
word. I know sometimes we're afraid of the word prophetically, but okay, futuristically. All over the

456
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:03.350
world, God is calling his church to rise and shine for your light has come. Although the darkness,

457
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:08.400
I'm going to read the chapter, you can just put the verse, this is my verse 61 and to arise and

458
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:14.550
shine for your light has come. The glory of the Lord is risen upon you. Darkness as black as night

459
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.520
covers all the earth, but all the nations will come to your glory because the Lord has risen over

460
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.330
you and when you go further down it says, your eyes are filled with light and your heart is full of

461
01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:27.380
joy. This is our moment people,

462
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:36.650
this is your moment to rise. And even if you crawl a bit, even if you stumble, I was just showing

463
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:43.190
people that like two little little nephews, like a little sister, one year old twins. And for the

464
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.900
first time she was running in the big ocean like on the on the seashore and she was falling and she

465
01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.750
had to balance ourselves because the wind was blowing because it was the first time that she was

466
01:05:51.750 --> 01:06:00.080
free. So God is crap for us when we are standing up and rising, even if we fall and stumble, just

467
01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.620
remember that you are a new level. So on new levels you will have to activate new strength, new

468
01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:12.670
capacity. And so just remember that your season today and I'm speaking this to each one of you can

469
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:18.830
use your names. Your season is to rise and shine your light has come and when we rise, what does

470
01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:25.540
that mean? We take responsibility. We take responsibility for our future and for our fresh start. So

471
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:32.210
in your journal, write down what is the responsibility today that you are going to take? What is the

472
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:40.430
responsibility that you're gonna take today? What is it that I can contribute to my future? You have

473
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.700
it inside of you.

474
01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.940
You know, I always said that a couple of years ago, I said don't cheat us by not taking your place

475
01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:55.130
in this world because it's something that only you can give. There's something about God that only

476
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:59.770
you can reflect that I cannot reflect, therefore we don't need to compare one another and be jealous

477
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:08.870
about each other stand. And so my message today is we confront all those things that keep us stuck

478
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:14.630
and we're repositioning ourselves with new mindsets with new habits, with new priorities, with new

479
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:19.210
understanding. And the way we do this is we are being transformed by his love and by his

480
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:26.660
understanding because he wants to take us to new levels to rise with greater impact. You know, we

481
01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:33.860
talk about the Seven Mountains, you know, education, film, art, sports, God wants you to take take

482
01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:40.440
your place, all those, all those fears, the Church of God needs to think Kingdom God is calling us

483
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.750
to an excellent mind. You have an excellent mind. Remember Adam when God created Adam and didn't

484
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:50.760
tell Adam you name the animals. Adam didn't think twice to name them and call them like all

485
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.270
these names that we have today. Like I said, look, I don't think God created all those other animals

486
01:07:56.270 --> 01:08:00.610
that are always those mosquitoes. I don't believe that those things that bothered me, I just said no,

487
01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:06.950
I don't think I can create those things. Maybe Adam just mixed up that. But anyway, God gave him an

488
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:13.510
excellent mind. So when the fall came, we lost that capacity. And guess what Adam did. The very

489
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:20.060
first question that God asked a human being was... What is the very first question? I always ask this. "Where

490
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:27.800
are you?" Where are you Ask Adam, where are you? And then he said, I'm hiding. And the first issue

491
01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:35.670
here is he hides because it was ashamed. And then God says, come out of hiding, you had an excellent

492
01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:40.870
mind and now you have a defeated mindset. Now you're like a victim now you blame your wife and we

493
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:46.580
all ever since start doing the blame game. Let's forget about blaming each other right now. Can we

494
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:51.450
just repent and just give it to Jesus today and said no more. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna blame

495
01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:59.620
anyone anymore. I have capacity. I have the capacity now to take responsibility and ownership for

496
01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:03.860
the life that God has given to me, I had to do that because guess what? No one is going to do it for

497
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.250
me and I'm gonna live and and miss out on what he has for you. But let's do this as a body as a as a

498
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:15.650
community of faith, as people of God. Where we stand and rise and shine and you know, there's

499
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:20.770
another part where I just I was saying this, I always use this as an example that God is a

500
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:25.780
dressmaker. You know, we as women, we like, I think men too, we like clothing things need to really

501
01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.610
fit as well. The first when Adam sinned and he was covering themselves with fig leaves. Do you know

502
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:39.970
that God actually made clothing for him and dressed him and so tonight, today, this morning wherever

503
01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:46.860
you are, whenever you can listen to this, May God address us today with light with understanding

504
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:54.400
with his love with this capacity, May you know, maybe gives you that may the Lord of the universe

505
01:09:54.410 --> 01:10:00.620
come over and change your narrative. Sing a new song, put a new song in your heart. People, we're

506
01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:06.100
never too big or too high to receive from God because their levels that he says, he says the path of

507
01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:12.820
the Righteous is like the shining light shining ever brighter. So we always go higher. I believe

508
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.690
that we all have to be, I think after the pandemic we all just need to be on our knees and say God

509
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.750
teach us, teach us what we need to do because like we don't know now like it's new, everything is

510
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:27.760
new. I don't want to borrow old stuff, I don't want to go back. And so the only place that you're

511
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.080
gonna get the new is in the presence of God. The only place that we're going to receive the

512
01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:40.650
strategies and the capacity is when we're gonna have ears to hear and eyes to see and that, my

513
01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:50.820
dear friends, is when we can be activated and rise to build communities like this spaces wherever of

514
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:56.320
people who love God with full of passion and fire and we can love the altar of prayer and of his

515
01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:03.060
word and full of fire and we can spend time in his presence and say God, what are you saying to me?

516
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:07.060
I don't know if I should take this job. I don't even make this choice. If I should marry this person.

517
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:12.780
I don't know if I, if I should write this book or not. I don't know how to say my yes or my no. Guide

518
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:20.830
me in my decision making process. God is here. He's inviting you today to do that and show. So maybe

519
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:28.290
rise to become, maybe rise to build and maybe rise to influence and I'm just going to leave you

520
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:32.660
there. I'm gonna finish all that I wanted to say, but I just want to leave that with you that God is

521
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:37.600
calling us today and I want to speak blessings over you this morning. I want to speak blessings that

522
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:45.790
God wants to bless you today. God cares about you in a restoration is a kingdom advantage. You know,

523
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:50.250
if you messed up your life and you feel okay, I don't know it's too late or after all, whatever God

524
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:55.590
says no. Today can be like the beginning of a brand new day. I said to them. God can take seven

525
01:11:55.590 --> 01:12:01.440
years of your life and put into one year. He can speed up your restoration process. God is a God who

526
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:07.210
is so extraordinary. Don't limit him to a past season that you've gone through. Be like a little kid

527
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:12.320
like running on the beach like wide eyed and curious. They're not afraid of the waves. God come

528
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:17.760
catch me, I'm running, I'm not, I'm afraid, but I'm going to go forward. May God bless you. May you

529
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:24.020
rise in the workplace where you are. May wherever you go, May God give you that presence that he

530
01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:28.720
would be a person who will really love him so much that when you come into a space you will shift

531
01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.370
the environment when people come to you because they know this light inside of you and the light is

532
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:40.820
Jesus, the light of the world, Jesus how Jesus who loves you so deeply lives inside of you. He said

533
01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:47.150
may you have the eyes to see the deep love that it has for you and out of that love, May you be

534
01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:54.020
empowered. So only the love of God, only his presence empowers us to rise. And so I want to invite

535
01:12:54.020 --> 01:13:02.370
you to stand as a as I pray for us and as I have a few moments just for us to respond to his word

536
01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.550
and

537
01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.530
I want you to make your own declarations in your heart today,

538
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.920
even this very moment, you can pray in your own heart and say Jesus, I give you access to my life.

539
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:27.940
If you someone who said I've never even thought about Jesus, I don't know him to say Jesus, I give

540
01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.550
you access and permission and he will take you and it will guide you step by step

541
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:43.060
and I want to invite you just to say Jesus, I'm saying yes to you, I'm gonna do this. I don't know

542
01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:47.000
how, I don't know exactly know everything but I know that you're there because you're lying to your

543
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.640
word, your love will reposition me and I refuse to settle for A level that is not equal to my D. N.

544
01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:02.900
A. My D. N. A. Is connected to a kingdom mindset. I have a royal D. N. A. The visit I was reading

545
01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.500
and I'm going to read while you're praying, he says that

546
01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:15.970
we are a royal priesthood, holy nation, the people belonging to God.

547
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:31.660
So God calls us both priests and kings and as God ushers us into that into our future may give us a

548
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:37.310
deep thirst for him. Holy Spirit. I pray that you would come and just make your word, translate your

549
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:44.750
word into each heart here and made them know that you celebrate them no matter what the story may,

550
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:48.820
they know that you have something so much extraordinary, so much more for them

551
01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:56.240
and whatever comes in between that truth I pray that you would break down those altars, those

552
01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:02.770
strongholds that are keeping us stuck. They're robbing us every day of the beauty and the life that

553
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:09.540
you have for us. And so I speak for God that you love each one of us and that you think of us highly

554
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:15.090
and that you're calling us the greater things than ever before. That you don't do a bad patch up job

555
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:23.140
in our lives but you breathe new life, you breathe resurrection and you redeem us with quality, you

556
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:28.730
restore us to a place not where we've been before, but to a higher place, a place that we've never

557
01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:35.550
ever experienced before. And so I pray for this blessing of our people. Your people pray that you

558
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:42.170
would expand our capacity to receive today that we would hold fast that we would have energy and the

559
01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:48.180
courage and the determination to press through. And also God, I pray for blessings on every person's

560
01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:54.570
finances and every person who needs jobs, who needs a home and who feels like God, I serve you. But

561
01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:58.960
I don't see anything that you're doing for me. So I must I serve you anything of that God. I just

562
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:06.840
pray that you would do your people good and we love you so much and father would take for that

563
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.650
commandment when he said arise

564
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:18.220
the rise and shine for our moment has come and we don't want to miss this moment. So we bless you in

565
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:24.810
the name of the Father, in the name of the son and in the name of your Holy Spirit, Amen God bless

566
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:30.040
you. God bless you. And I think was

567
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:47.910
yeah. Mhm. This gathering out with another song and I believe that God definitely used Pastor Yvonne

568
01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.820
and his word to speak to our hearts today, Amen it was a beautiful message and we're so glad that

569
01:16:53.820 --> 01:17:00.510
she was able to share that with us and so as we would take this opportunity right now to sing this

570
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:09.270
song together, it's a reminder of how we can take what we've heard and apply it to our lives and ask

571
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:15.730
God to show us where we need to apply it. And so let's sing this song together and then I'll be back

572
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.710
to close this out. Amen

573
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.380
we're gonna sing the song how beautiful take the words to heart

574
01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:42.960
because you

575
01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.640

576
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.030
