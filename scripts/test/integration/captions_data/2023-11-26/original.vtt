1
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.690
Am seeking,

2
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:14.679
searching for the things this world has rejected, the things that are broken that are flawed, thrown

3
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.599
away and discarded.

4
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:27.580
I seek the lost, the damaged, the forgotten things, the overlooked and the neglected,

5
00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:34.000
the things that have been pushed aside and left behind.

6
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.619
Why? Why do I do this?

7
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.309
Why? Chase after that, which is despised by so many.

8
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:04.260
It is because I have chosen to reject it. I bring restoration to the rob. I see beyond the flaws and

9
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:12.179
the imperfections and I bring new life to the loss. This world has called them useless and garbage,

10
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.539
hopeless and unwanted.

11
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:27.869
They have been scarred, abused, ignored and unloved, but I, I have reclaimed them and they belong to

12
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:36.969
me now. They are my masterpiece and I have a plan and a future for every single one

13
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:48.090
for. I am crafting these dissonant and discarded pieces into something beautiful

14
00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:11.750
rivers edge. We are so blessed that you could join us in person today. For this gathering. We are

15
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:20.260
here to welcome and accept you the way you are and, and, and to help you live an authentic life of

16
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:28.469
faith, love and hope. Let's also welcome our online community. Joining us from various platforms

17
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:38.239

18
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:47.979

19
00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:55.419
for you. We are continuing with our series called Rejected. And today's message is called Rejected

20
00:11:55.429 --> 00:12:03.419
by God. Please stand and let's welcome the River's Edge worship team as we sing the first song today.

21
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:12.099
Welcome, welcome. We're gonna sing King of all because we want to worship the king of all, all of

22
00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:17.109
our worries, all of our troubles. We're just gonna put it all to him. He is the king over all of it.

23
00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:17.820
Hallelujah.

24
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.640
Good morning. You are the lips every morning. Mm

25
00:12:42.609 --> 00:12:53.200
Because you are faithful in every way. That's right. And I will declare that your love lasts forever.

26
00:12:57.369 --> 00:13:11.210
No need to worry. My eyes fixed on you. You have my heart of my heart, my life. Now

27
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.359
I you are my strength. Hallelujah.

28
00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:22.140
The

29
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:27.700
I was three

30
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:53.530
through every desert. Your love makes a riff, right?

31
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.200
Bringing new,

32
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.000
not feel the wind of your spear

33
00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:14.119
and I'm chasing I go,

34
00:14:16.219 --> 00:14:16.549

35
00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:36.010
the

36
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.510
good three

37
00:14:50.309 --> 00:14:54.919
to you. We will follow only you. We will follow.

38
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:30.989
Oh

39
00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:38.440
oh, let's all sing that together.

40
00:16:39.429 --> 00:16:39.450
I

41
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.810
all three sides poison.

42
00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:18.359
Let's give thanks. Get back God

43
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.630
with a man and I was stretched on

44
00:18:48.239 --> 00:18:48.510
and,

45
00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:53.900
and on. Just

46
00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:31.859
the ride the setting

47
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.109
and great carry

48
00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:20.189
body in space,

49
00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:09.989
things.

50
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:56.660
You

51
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:00.819
are you.

52
00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:01.150
Hm Thank you God, thank you that you're here. Thank you that you love us and you're for us and you

53
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:09.410
see us, you see every heart in this room, God, you see every heart, you know what they need. God, I

54
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:16.430
just thank you that as we behold you, we become you. We see you as who you are in all your splendor.

55
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:26.939
And this is how we become more like you. And I just thank you God that as we worship, we remind our

56
00:23:26.949 --> 00:23:34.680
souls who you are. We tell our circumstances who you are. We don't let our circumstances tell us who

57
00:23:34.689 --> 00:23:45.479
you are. We call our circumstances up to you, God. You are higher. I just pray for each and every

58
00:23:45.489 --> 00:23:53.890
heart in this room to receive what they need as we worship you. That your presence is the safest

59
00:23:53.900 --> 00:24:00.770
most precious place. It's the only place we want to be. And I thank you that you are in us. You are

60
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:07.390
around us. You are for us. You're not against us. You go for us. You follow us behind God. You just

61
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.430
cover us.

62
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:16.969
I pray for that awareness and guys, I just wanted to encourage you whatever you're going through.

63
00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:25.729
When we worship, we speak to our souls and we speak to God and something shifts when you speak that

64
00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:35.359
out who He is. He loves you. And I know it's not always easy. Sometimes we get comfy, but I wanna

65
00:24:35.369 --> 00:24:41.260
call us up and I wanna encourage you to lift your hands. Maybe it's like here, maybe it's here. The

66
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:48.650
Bible says to lift holy hands and it's just an act of surrender. It's a response, a heart response

67
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:56.000
to who he is. And it tells your body to come up to what your spirit, what he's doing says, yeah,

68
00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:02.469
we're going to lay it down now. We're going to give us our all. We're gonna lay it down now because

69
00:25:02.479 --> 00:25:08.579
he is so worthy and you can, you can do as much as you're comfortable. Sometimes it's up here,

70
00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:13.119
sometimes it's down here, sometimes it's here. Whatever you feel today is comfortable for you. I

71
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:21.160
just encourage you to do that. Let's let's push ourselves and let's, let's just behold him and let

72
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:26.819
ourselves respond to that because he's so worthy. I'm gonna sing this song and it's very simple.

73
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:35.660
It's simple and it's slow but it's so powerful. So let's sing this together. Focus on him

74
00:25:38.199 --> 00:25:41.689
a whole of my heart.

75
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:51.670
Open the eyes of my bye. I want,

76
00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.609
I want to

77
00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:03.280
sing that again. Open the eyes.

78
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.290
We are,

79
00:26:13.329 --> 00:26:14.099
we are.

80
00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.829

81
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.530

you. So for our serve team, this is for our kids ministry. We are still looking for volunteers as we

175
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:40.020
there. So now for our four ways to give, we want to thank all of you for your financial generosity.

176
00:41:40.189 --> 00:41:48.020
We appreciate it very much and there are several ways to give um as you can see up on the screen and

177
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:55.590
we encourage you to choose the best option. Um And then any amount that you give will help us so

178
00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:02.989
much in continuing the church and in continuing our ministries. So once again, thank you. So let us

179
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.030
go now to the message. Please welcome our one and only pastor, Pastor Zo DellaForesta

180
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:41.889
I, I really didn't expect that to happen um because it hadn't happened for 13 years and for as long

181
00:42:41.899 --> 00:42:49.709
as I've been the chaplain, they were losing. So the previous chaplain had won three times. So it

182
00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:56.899
kind of tells you the difference maybe in ministry too. Um But it, it was just an unexpected event

183
00:42:56.909 --> 00:43:04.570
uh for me, uh they had to win eight games in a row to do this and they did it. And every time II, I

184
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.199
felt like because, um I don't think I've shared this, I'm gonna share it really quickly. I've been

185
00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:15.100
preparing an assistant um to help me uh in this ministry that I do to the pro sports team. So I take

186
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:19.780
care of the is of West a lot of people don't know that I also take care of CF Montreal, the soccer

187
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:25.689
team and I'm also the chaplain for the Montreal Canadians and the, the Rocket. And on top of that, I

188
00:43:25.699 --> 00:43:31.919
take care of the two basketball teams that we have here, the tundra and as well as the Alliance. And

189
00:43:31.929 --> 00:43:38.669
so it's a lot of teams and, um, it adds a lot to my schedule to my ministry. Um, but it's something

190
00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:44.899
that I really feel called to. So I do it and, but in the last few years, it's been a struggle for me

191
00:43:44.909 --> 00:43:52.229
to keep doing it because um, the ministry kept expanding. But I, I'm still the one guy doing it. And

192
00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:56.419
so I kept praying God bring someone so that they can take on the Alouettes, which is the most time

193
00:43:56.429 --> 00:44:03.520
consuming. Um, and, and God did exactly that he brought someone, um, a young man by the name of Jake.

194
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:10.550
um he was already the chaplain for the Bishop Gaitors and in uh Lennoxville and he was on campus

195
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.810
there for, for a few years and I've been preparing him to take on the role of being the chaplain for

196
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:23.350
the Montreal West, so I could step away and focus on those other teams, but as well as um give more

197
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.959
time, of course to river's edge. Um And so, and God prepared that. And so it was amazing that I felt

198
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:38.219
that God was telling me, um it's gonna be, you know, his, his first grade cup. Um, and it's gonna be

199
00:44:38.229 --> 00:44:44.189
yours as well. And it was just weird. It was just a weird feeling. Um, he was starting and I was, um,

200
00:44:44.199 --> 00:44:49.040
ending, you know, and, and I, I didn't want to believe it, you know, sometimes you get a word and

201
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:53.169
you're like, ah, it's still good to be true. It's crazy. Like, the team is not good enough to go all

202
00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:59.550
the way and they won eight times and God did exactly what he said he would do. He did the impossible.

203
00:45:00.679 --> 00:45:05.800
And sometimes God like, wants to do the impossible. We just, we just, we're just not there to

204
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:11.379
believe it. You know, I just want you to know that I wasn't there either because I had gotten so

205
00:45:11.389 --> 00:45:12.179
used to losing.

206
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:20.669
Does that make sense? I, I did, I just got used to losing and, and even in the big games, I just

207
00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.840
expected, anticipated that we would lose. And so today, I want to speak to you about that because

208
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:33.669
sometimes we can get comfortable in our losing that we just don't expect things to be any different.

209
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.850
And so the, the message that we're in today is really talking about being rejected by God. And I

210
00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:47.429
want to read this story um in John chapter five and in John chapter five, it says this in verse one,

211
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:54.419
that after these things, there was a feast uh to the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and, and

212
00:45:54.429 --> 00:46:02.129
now in Jerusalem, by the sheet gate, there is a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda. And it had

213
00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:11.379
five porticos. And in these porticos lay a multitude of those who were sick, they were blind, they

214
00:46:11.389 --> 00:46:22.469
were limping or paralyzed. And now there was a man there who had been ill for 38 years. And Jesus

215
00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:28.429
upon seeing this man lying there and knowing that he had already been in that condition for a long

216
00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:36.040
time, said to him, do you want to get well? And then the sick man answered him and said, sir, I have

217
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:43.419
no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up because they believed that it was being

218
00:46:43.429 --> 00:46:52.040
stirred up by, by angels. And while I am coming, making his way to the pool, another steps down

219
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:58.620
before me. And so that they received the healing instead of me. And so Jesus just looks at the man

220
00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:09.580
and he says, get up, pick up your mat and walk and immediately the man became well and he picked up

221
00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:18.949
his mat and he began to walk and immediately the man became well and he picked up his mat and began

222
00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:25.500
to walk and it was the Sabbath on that day. And the scriptures tell us in verse 10, that the Jews

223
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.560
were saying to the man

224
00:47:30.229 --> 00:47:40.479
who was cured, it is a Sabbath and it is not permissible for you to carry your man. But he answered

225
00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:47.709
them, he who made me well was the one who said to me, pick up your mat and walk. And they asked him

226
00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:55.020
who is the man who said to you pick it up and walk? But the man who was healed did not know who it

227
00:47:55.030 --> 00:48:03.570
was because Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place. And afterward, Jesus found

228
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:16.459
him in the temple and said to him, behold, you have become well. So stop sinning so that nothing

229
00:48:16.469 --> 00:48:22.989
worse happens to you. And the man went away and informed the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him

230
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:30.770
well. And for this reason, the Jews were persecuting Jesus because he was doing things on the

231
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:39.729
Sabbath, but he answered them, my father is always working and so am I,

232
00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:47.469
you see, God doesn't need to take the Sabbath. Um And so Jesus says, neither do I,

233
00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:54.739
I want to start off by saying that there was a party, there was a festival. And so I don't know

234
00:48:54.750 --> 00:49:00.139
about you, but this past weekend, uh you know, for a lot of people, it was American Thanksgiving.

235
00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:08.030
And um we celebrated Thanksgiving earlier in October and now we're entering into a season of feasts

236
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:14.020
and festivals as we approach Christmas. We're just, I can't believe we're just four weeks away. Um

237
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:20.739
And here we are like there was a festival even during this time and yet Jesus isn't like, you know,

238
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:27.760
with the people you would expect him to be with at a feast or a festival. Uh Jesus is, is, is at a

239
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:33.489
place where the marginalized are all the people that don't get to celebrate the feast in the

240
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:40.379
festivals. That's where Jesus is. And he goes to the very place where people are just without hope,

241
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:48.830
they're without being able to be festive. Everyone else is celebrating but not those that are under

242
00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.270
these five porticos

243
00:49:52.879 --> 00:50:01.820
and the pool of Bethesda is important because it's an Aramaic word, meaning the house of mercy. And

244
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:07.159
yet this is a place where no one is experiencing mercy. This is a place where everyone feels they

245
00:50:07.169 --> 00:50:12.770
are without mercy. It is a place where everyone believes that they are cursed by God, not blessed by

246
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:18.020
Him. It's not a place where they are being restored. It's a place where they feel that they're

247
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:28.330
abandoned. And sometimes that's the place we feel we're in. And it was important to note that this

248
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:38.239
pool of Bethesda, this house of mercy, it always needed fresh water to feed this poor. It wasn't

249
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:42.949
water, that was stagnant. And so people believed that because it was fresh water continuously coming

250
00:50:42.959 --> 00:50:49.669
into it, it had healing properties. And on top of that, a superstition had been built over time

251
00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:57.370
where they believed that angels actually came down and stirred it. Now, I I believe that it was a

252
00:50:57.379 --> 00:51:02.169
superstition. There are those who will contest that. And many people preach this passage saying and

253
00:51:02.179 --> 00:51:07.659
speak on this and teach on this saying that um it was angels who were stirring the waters. But I

254
00:51:07.669 --> 00:51:12.979
believe the reason Jesus goes there is because he's there to confront superstition and religion.

255
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:22.479
I believe he's there to set the record straight. I believe he's there to show everyone that instead

256
00:51:22.489 --> 00:51:27.830
of waiting on angels, you need to be believing on Jesus,

257
00:51:30.969 --> 00:51:36.979
Instead of waiting for someone to come and help your help has already come.

258
00:51:39.389 --> 00:51:43.860
And, and sometimes we're, we're in a place where we're just waiting for something to happen. And I

259
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:50.409
believe this man just got so used to waiting that he just didn't know when the waiting should end.

260
00:51:52.629 --> 00:51:56.290
It was a place that people went for healing but never found it.

261
00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:04.100
And so from his perspective, people are, are, are receiving a healing and a blessing. But he's the

262
00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:09.270
one that's always being left out and it gets to the point where he just continuously feels abandoned

263
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:16.379
and rejected by God. And Jesus needs to confront that. And I believe that when he asks this question,

264
00:52:16.389 --> 00:52:20.760
it's, it's, it's the most important question that he can ask. And I think that when he asks this in

265
00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:30.250
this story, I believe he's asking us and he's asking us this question. Do you want to get well? Now

266
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:36.110
the thing is that when I hear this question, I think the obvious reason is come on like that just

267
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:42.570
gets me more frustrated. It gets me a little bit more angry. It makes me feel more disappointment.

268
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:49.260
It feels like God, you're just playing with me now, like you show up and then you tell me this. But

269
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:55.870
remember this man doesn't know who Jesus is and he doesn't know what Jesus is capable of. So when he

270
00:52:55.879 --> 00:53:02.989
asks this question, this man believes that this man warrants a response because he doesn't know who

271
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.169
it is that he's in front of. But there's something else that is happening in the story and, and it's

272
00:53:09.179 --> 00:53:15.250
something that we may have missed before. And that is the reason Jesus asks him, do you want to get

273
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.320
well is because it's been 38 years.

274
00:53:22.189 --> 00:53:29.020
And I think what Jesus does is that he points out in this man's heart that he has just accepted

275
00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:36.360
that things are not going to change how many of us in this room have made that same decision in some

276
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:42.889
area of our life. We, we just accepted it like we're just saying, it's not gonna be any different.

277
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.429
It's been like this for one year. It's been like this for 38 years. I am no longer expecting and

278
00:53:49.439 --> 00:53:56.500
anticipating things to be different. And so Jesus needs to confront that. The first thing he needs

279
00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:04.770
to do is he needs to wake us up and say, do you want to get well? Like is that desire still in there?

280
00:54:07.129 --> 00:54:16.489
Or, or have you just lied down on your mat and gotten comfortable to the point where year after year

281
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:23.820
you just accept that things are not gonna be any different. Are you paralyzed where you are? Instead

282
00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:28.330
of getting up and going to where God is sending you?

283
00:54:30.679 --> 00:54:41.850
Well, Jesus understands that when our desire to be healed is gone, he needs to ask the question.

284
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:52.120
I see people who are just living with their condition, just living with their situation and their

285
00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:57.370
circumstances. And can I just speak into that for a second? Now, maybe you, you're gonna find this

286
00:54:57.379 --> 00:54:57.959
harsh,

287
00:55:00.389 --> 00:55:06.899
but I need you to hear me. I need you to see this when you stop living. It means that you have died.

288
00:55:10.239 --> 00:55:17.060
When you stop believing for greater, it means that you've given up and you know what people do.

289
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:24.110
People who, who, who, who respond to that are the people who take their lives and they commit

290
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:31.250
suicide and they do it because they really don't believe there's any way for things to be different.

291
00:55:31.949 --> 00:55:37.560
They'd rather end the suffering than keep living that way one more moment. And you know what a lot

292
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:46.030
of us have just committed suicide and, but we're still alive, we're still awake, we still have a

293
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:51.449
chance and an opportunity and this man is just waiting for his life to end and I don't want you to

294
00:55:51.459 --> 00:55:58.060
be that person. And so what Jesus does is that when he confronts him and he says to him, do you want

295
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:05.620
to get well? Do you want to succeed in your life? Do you want to still remain single? Do you still

296
00:56:05.629 --> 00:56:11.800
want your business to succeed? Do you still want your marriage to get better? Do you want your child

297
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:17.600
to come back to serving the Lord? Do you want to see change in your life? Like never before? Do you

298
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:24.489
want to see the breakthroughs? God is saying, do you want to get well, what is your answer? What

299
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:29.949
comes from the innermost part of your being? Or do you find yourself just paralyzed lying on that

300
00:56:29.959 --> 00:56:32.280
mat? You see the difference.

301
00:56:34.399 --> 00:56:42.120
And what God does is that he confronts that. And what the man does is that he starts to complain and

302
00:56:42.129 --> 00:56:44.040
he starts giving reasons.

303
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:51.790
And the funny thing is is that he doesn't know that he's giving reasons to the one who can heal him.

304
00:56:53.919 --> 00:56:59.669
And, and I feel like we do that with God, like we're giving him all the reasons why things are the

305
00:56:59.679 --> 00:57:07.909
same, why things haven't changed, why things have not improved. And you see when our focus is on

306
00:57:07.919 --> 00:57:19.610
another solution instead of Jesus, then we enter into a pattern of complaint. But when our focus

307
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:27.209
remains on Jesus, who is the healer, then our focus is still hopeful. Our focus is on the

308
00:57:27.219 --> 00:57:36.439
breakthrough. Our focus is on the miracle. It's on the impossible being possible. But when it's not

309
00:57:36.449 --> 00:57:46.479
on Jesus. This is what happens. We become people who just complain. And when we complain, it keeps

310
00:57:46.489 --> 00:57:47.379
us on the mat,

311
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.219
it keeps us paralyzed.

312
00:57:54.229 --> 00:58:02.969
Because what he does is that he begins to go through all of his excuses and he believes that his

313
00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:10.959
healer is someone and something else. But when you believe you're rejected by God, here's what

314
00:58:10.969 --> 00:58:15.600
happens. All of your reasons become your only reality.

315
00:58:18.479 --> 00:58:30.429
That's all you see. That's all you can focus on. That's all you can share your reasons. Here's the

316
00:58:30.439 --> 00:58:37.000
reason, here's the reason, this is the reason this is why this happened to me. They did this to me.

317
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:42.610
This is why they rejected me. This is how I'm rejected by God. This is how I'm cursed instead of

318
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:48.290
blessed. This is why I'm paralyzed. This is why I've been stuck all these years. This is why I'm not

319
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:52.310
healed. This is why I haven't had my breakthrough and this is what we do.

320
00:58:56.969 --> 00:59:04.600
And this man is just saying over and over again, I'm rejected by God. He says I'm paralyzed and I

321
00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:13.189
can't get in on my own. There's no one to help me. There's always someone else who steps in before

322
00:59:13.199 --> 00:59:21.379
me and takes the miracle away from me. Does that sound familiar? Just a little bit. It's been

323
00:59:21.389 --> 00:59:25.429
moments in your life where you felt that way where you've said those things where you've believed

324
00:59:25.439 --> 00:59:33.169
them even just for a moment. I think the answer is. Yes. If I'm honest, the answer is yes. If I'm

325
00:59:33.179 --> 00:59:40.169
being truthful right now, the answer is yes, I've been there, I've done this and that's why it's so

326
00:59:40.179 --> 00:59:46.030
important for us to, to be able to move beyond this point. So what God does is that he interrupts

327
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:46.750
his cycle,

328
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:56.649
he interrupts what has been happening for 38 years. I don't know how old you are. I don't know how

329
00:59:56.659 --> 01:00:03.590
long you've been in your cycle. But I want you to say to God right now, God interrupt my cycle.

330
01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:09.520
Oh, that, that was good for a few of you.

331
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.620
Maybe we need to do it differently.

332
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:25.330
Turn to the person next to you and tell them break the cycle.

333
01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:29.530
Oh, you see, that was easier

334
01:00:33.149 --> 01:00:40.719
telling other people what to do is always easier

335
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:55.139
than telling ourselves, isn't it true? Right. Like let's break the cycle for sure. And I, I know

336
01:00:55.149 --> 01:00:59.760
that it's not easy guys. Listen, I, I, I've been here, I've been there. II, I know what you're going

337
01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:06.469
through. I really do in many ways, more ways than, you know, but I know that God is trying to break

338
01:01:06.479 --> 01:01:17.560
this cycle that we're in. And so that's why Jesus tells him first to get up and, and I, I always

339
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:23.179
bothered me, how do you tell a paralyzed person to get up? Makes no sense? Like that's not the first

340
01:01:23.189 --> 01:01:29.929
thing you tell them. The first thing you tell them is that. Hey, God loves you.

341
01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:37.179
Right? The second thing you tell him is like, you can do it.

342
01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:46.439
I know it's hard. I know you've got your reasons but you can do it right. There's a, there's so many

343
01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:54.149
other places to go first. The first thing Jesus goes and he just says, get up and, and he speaks

344
01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:59.870
with command and with authority when the man I believe is shook in that moment where he just looks

345
01:01:59.879 --> 01:02:05.649
at himself and he hears those words and he's like, I don't know where this power is coming from. But

346
01:02:05.659 --> 01:02:06.830
I feel like I can,

347
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:15.169
I feel like I must, you see when God speaks into you and tells you to get up. He doesn't just tell

348
01:02:15.179 --> 01:02:23.010
you the words, but he gives you the power to do it. Oh Come on. It isn't just words, it's power.

349
01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:32.010
It's not just a motivational phrase, it's his presence all of a sudden you feel strength in the

350
01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:38.739
parts of your body that you have always been weak in. See, that's what happens in the moment because

351
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.739
God did not create you

352
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.629
to lie down, but he created you to get up and walk.

353
01:02:49.919 --> 01:02:58.300
God has created you to get up and walk. So when we lie down, God needs to speak into that and tell

354
01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:07.110
us get up why. Because right now, he knows that all of us in this room, we just want to lie down in

355
01:03:07.169 --> 01:03:15.260
disappointment and defeat. We just like we've done this church thing. We've done this God thing.

356
01:03:15.689 --> 01:03:20.520
We've done this, trying to be a community thing. We've done this, trying to be friends with other

357
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:25.790
believers. They just, we're just gonna get disappointed. We're just gonna get frustrated and hurt.

358
01:03:26.189 --> 01:03:33.229
We're just gonna be the ones who, who feel the pain all over again. Come on. Isn't that us? And we

359
01:03:33.239 --> 01:03:41.290
just give up and we, we go back to a place of, of just being paralyzed because the disappointment

360
01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:48.169
and defeat is just so real and so powerful in our life that we can't even hear his command to get up

361
01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:53.629
and walk because we are just so accustomed to just lying down and waiting.

362
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.850
And so Jesus gives an impossible command to obey.

363
01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:10.870
And the reason He gives you this impossible command is because it's going to take a breakthrough in

364
01:04:10.879 --> 01:04:17.989
your life for you to believe that the impossible is possible. You see if God doesn't tell you get up,

365
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.389
you never know that the impossible is possible. You never know that things can change. You never

366
01:04:25.399 --> 01:04:31.020
know that things can be different. You, you want to believe it. But it's hard for you to trust that

367
01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:39.649
because you're going through so many things. This man lied down for 38 years. I want you to know

368
01:04:39.659 --> 01:04:48.590
that in 38 years, things changed for him as much as they would change for us. If we go back 38 years,

369
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:59.350
we are in 1985. Can you imagine that? Ok. In 1985 Microsoft Windows released 1.0

370
01:05:04.689 --> 01:05:06.310
and it had glitches. Even then

371
01:05:12.969 --> 01:05:18.719
in 1985 Sony Discman and C DS came out. Anybody have one of those.

372
01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:27.949
It was crazy. It was such an innovation in being able to listen to music.

373
01:05:29.989 --> 01:05:36.689
There are so many things that happened technologically, the world changed. I could go on, you know,

374
01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.489
there's so many things that happened in 1985.

375
01:05:41.709 --> 01:05:50.419
But I want you to think of all those things happen without this guy and a lot of things just happen

376
01:05:50.429 --> 01:05:59.310
without us. See, the world didn't stop because we stopped because we got disappointed because we

377
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:10.669
felt defeated because we lied down. See, God kept working. God never took a break and he moved on to

378
01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:16.800
other people who, when he said get up, they got up

379
01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:23.489
when he told them take up your mat and walk, they did it.

380
01:06:26.679 --> 01:06:35.110
And I believe that God is giving us a word today where he has told us before, get up. He has told us

381
01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:42.649
before, take up our mat and walk and we haven't done it. We've stayed where we were and time has

382
01:06:42.659 --> 01:06:49.899
passed and technology is advanced. The world kept changing and we stayed the same.

383
01:06:53.350 --> 01:07:00.189
Anybody else fed up with that. Anybody else want a different outcome, a different life, a different

384
01:07:00.199 --> 01:07:09.389
future, a different possibility. You know, there was a time when as an athlete, I was always

385
01:07:09.399 --> 01:07:18.030
competing against this one particular person who, um, he was always better than me and, uh, and he'd

386
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.870
be first and I'd be second and, and on the teams that we played on and the, the things that we did,

387
01:07:22.899 --> 01:07:26.540
he was always first and I was second. You know, I got used to being second

388
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:34.030
and I got content with being second because he was always first and except one day, I don't know

389
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:42.110
what came over me. But I just said, I, I'm just tired of being second today. I want to be first. And,

390
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.510
and, and I, and I worked at it and I worked at it and I worked at it. I worked at it and I worked

391
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.669
and I kept working at it and it got to the point where we went into a competition. I finally was

392
01:07:52.679 --> 01:08:00.639
first. But you know what happened, even though I had become first, we both got registered for the

393
01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:07.780
Quebec Provincials. But because I was the reserve, that's how he registered us. Even though I had

394
01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:16.528
beaten him. Life was still telling me I was second. But here's what happened that day when we were

395
01:08:16.539 --> 01:08:24.089
at the provincials and I couldn't compete as the number one person on the team. I walked around like

396
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:33.560
I was number one because I knew I had beaten the best guy. You see a lot of us in this room. We

397
01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:38.459
don't even know what that feeling. Is like, we don't know what it feels like to be number one in

398
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:46.240
anything. We just know what it looks like to have a participation medal if you're lucky and maybe

399
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:51.890
most likely just a ribbon. Those suck. They really do. Nobody wants the ribbon

400
01:08:55.569 --> 01:09:02.459
and I think God is trying to tell you and listen to this and excuse the sports analogy, but that's

401
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:14.990
what I do. You are his number one. You see that day Jesus went to find the one guy who for 38 years

402
01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:24.738
felt he could never be number one. And that day he said you are, you're number one. Can we say amen

403
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:34.609
to that? Come on, come on. Because if he can do it, if he can do it for that guy, he can do it for

404
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:45.009
us. And what Jesus does is that he rejects his superstitions, he rejects his disappointment and his

405
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:52.319
excuses and his reasons. He, he, he tells him to stop looking at his reality the same way and he

406
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:57.959
gives him something else. He says all of these things are false. But let me tell you what is true.

407
01:09:59.479 --> 01:10:06.720
The Bible says that he was immediately made well because he did the first thing that Jesus told him

408
01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:16.370
to do and that was get up. You see, no one can get up for you. You have to get up for yourself. No

409
01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:22.259
one can do this part. You have to do it. Jesus commands it but you have to obey it.

410
01:10:24.799 --> 01:10:32.589
When he tells you, you have to listen, you have to respond and, and then he tells him pick up your

411
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.959
mat and I love that because he tells him to pick up the mat. What is that mat? What, what does it

412
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:46.290
represent? It represents that you will never have to depend on this ever again. Pick up your mat

413
01:10:46.299 --> 01:10:54.560
because that's not who you are anymore. Pick up your mat because you are never going back, pick up

414
01:10:54.569 --> 01:11:01.279
your mat. Leave this place of rejection behind. You will never have to go back there

415
01:11:03.549 --> 01:11:13.290
and we're not gonna leave any symbol for someone else either for someone else to use it for someone

416
01:11:13.299 --> 01:11:21.009
else to lie down. Because when I come and I say get up, it isn't just for you. It's for you and

417
01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.609
everyone who comes after you.

418
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:31.529
And so you've got to be the one that when you walk around and everyone asks you, why are you

419
01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:41.140
carrying around that mat that you can say I'm carrying on this mat because for 38 years, I lied down

420
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:48.120
on it because that was my life for 38 years. This is where I was always stuck, disappointed and

421
01:11:48.129 --> 01:11:54.060
defeated for 38 years. This is where I was paralyzed and I thought that no one cared for me that I

422
01:11:54.069 --> 01:11:59.310
had been rejected by God and all of his people. This is what I thought. But today I carry this

423
01:11:59.319 --> 01:12:06.669
around because when you ask me today, why am I carrying around this mat? I carry around this mat

424
01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:15.250
because I am free. That used to be my life but not anymore. Let me tell you a new story, a story

425
01:12:15.259 --> 01:12:21.459
that started today, a story of how God intervened in my life, how he gave me the breakthrough that I

426
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:29.720
could never have brought in in my own life. But he came and he found me. And under five porticos of

427
01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:31.200
people who were blind,

428
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:43.140
who were deaf, who were crippled and paralyzed and people without hope, he found me. And when he

429
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:52.600
said the words get up, that's exactly what I did. And I have left that life behind. I want you to

430
01:12:52.609 --> 01:13:00.160
leave that life behind. I want you to leave that rejection behind. When Jesus tells you to get up,

431
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:06.959
pick up your mat and walk, just do it, do it. You know, there's a moment in the scriptures in

432
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:15.750
Matthew chapter 27 and in verse 46 look at what it says. It says at three o'clock, Jesus called out

433
01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:24.830
with a loud voice and then he says, Eli Eli Lema Sabatini, which means my God, my God. Why have you

434
01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:32.399
abandoned me? Why have you forsaken me? There's a moment when Jesus is on the cross and he says, why

435
01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:33.990
have you forsaken me?

436
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:43.000
I believe this man and Jesus have something in common now. So a connection that maybe you have not

437
01:13:43.009 --> 01:13:52.479
seen before. Look at what it says before this moment in Matthew 16 in verse 24 and 25. In verse 24

438
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:59.810
Jesus says to his disciples that if anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself, he must

439
01:13:59.819 --> 01:14:09.560
take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses

440
01:14:09.569 --> 01:14:16.759
his life for my sake will find it. And I want you to see that what Jesus commands here in the

441
01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:25.390
earlier verse in verse 24 is that you have to deny yourself and take up your cross. When he tells

442
01:14:25.399 --> 01:14:33.160
this man to deny himself all of his excuses, all of his reasons for his reality, he tells him to

443
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:39.450
pick up his mat. I want you to see that in this moment, picking up your mat and picking up your

444
01:14:39.459 --> 01:14:48.930
cross is leaving the past behind. It's embracing the new life that Jesus has in store for you. It's

445
01:14:48.939 --> 01:14:57.040
no longer believing that God cannot do the impossible because even as that man felt forsaken by God

446
01:14:57.049 --> 01:15:04.810
and by everyone, Jesus showed up in his life and told him I am gonna make sure that you are seen,

447
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:11.180
I'm gonna make sure that you are known. I'm gonna make sure that you are no longer paralyzed. I'm

448
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:18.479
gonna make sure that you were able to on this day to take up your mat and to walk again. And when

449
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:25.970
Jesus dies on the cross He says, I'm gonna make sure that I take all of the rejection on me. I'm

450
01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:32.290
gonna make sure that when I'm hanging there, you never ever go through life believing that you are

451
01:15:32.299 --> 01:15:39.970
rejected. You will never again believe for one moment that God can reject you because I am taking

452
01:15:39.979 --> 01:15:47.600
all of the rejection for you. You see when Jesus was hanging on the cross, he says just in case you

453
01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:55.189
still have doubt, I am going to take all of the rejection. There is no more rejection for you. Only

454
01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:03.839
acceptance, only love, only healing, only deliverance, only a new beginning. Only get up, pick up

455
01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:10.799
your mat and walk. You are not stuck. You are not paralyzed. You are no longer where you used to be.

456
01:16:10.819 --> 01:16:23.100
You're only going forward in Jesus name in Jesus name. No more rejection. You see Jesus defeated,

457
01:16:23.109 --> 01:16:34.140
rejection. So you can't be rejected by God. God has God has no reason and no authority to reject you

458
01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:42.759
because Jesus took it all himself and He has given us the authority to feel his acceptance. See if

459
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:48.009
you're feeling rejected today, that's not God because Jesus already took all that for you.

460
01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:57.220
Jesus is only here to give you your breakthrough. Are you ready to receive that? Are you ready to

461
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.759
have that?

462
01:17:00.009 --> 01:17:07.339
Hallelujah. All we need is Jesus every day. He's all we need every day. That's all we need. Would

463
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:14.649
you stand with me and would you come into his presence right now. And would you leave that rejection

464
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.359
behind?

465
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:25.890
And would you make the decision today wholeheartedly to move forward in the power of his presence

466
01:17:29.509 --> 01:17:35.649
and the power and the authority of his word, which tells you to get up and to leave that stuff

467
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:44.410
behind. Rejection no more. When people ask you about your matt,

468
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:53.609
they're going to be asking you but your cross. See, that's why Jesus says, take up your cross and

469
01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.319
follow me.

470
01:17:56.459 --> 01:18:01.720
So you're gonna be able to say, yeah, this is my old life. Here's my new life.

471
01:18:04.259 --> 01:18:08.859
See, I don't, I don't, I don't walk around with a mat. But every day I walk around carrying the

472
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:09.399
cross

473
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:19.410
because it reminds me every day that I am no longer rejected, I am accepted. It reminds me every day

474
01:18:19.419 --> 01:18:27.109
that I'm no longer sick, I'm healed. It reminds me every day that I am not broken. I am whole. It

475
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:35.129
reminds me every day, I'm not imprisoned, I'm free. It reminds me every day that this is not my

476
01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:45.450
addiction. This is my promise to God. I have experienced his breakthrough. I'm gonna live that

477
01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:53.129
breakthrough. You're gonna live that breakthrough. Are you ready to carry that cross? See, the cross

478
01:18:53.140 --> 01:19:00.470
isn't a, it was a burden for Jesus, but for us, it's a symbol of victory. See, when you carry the

479
01:19:00.479 --> 01:19:06.970
cross, you're telling the world that you are victorious. That's why he tells you to carry it just

480
01:19:06.979 --> 01:19:13.740
like the mat. Everyone saw it as a burden. But now it's a symbol of victory in his hands. You see

481
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:22.709
that used to be the old man. I used to lie on this thing. Now I get to carry it around because God

482
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:31.759
healed me. He made me whole. I used to be paralyzed. Not anymore. And so we carry our cross. Not as

483
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:39.529
a burden. Carrying the cross is not a burden. Everyone says it is, it's wrong. It's bad theology.

484
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:45.569
It's bad understanding of the scripture. It's bad understanding of what Christ has done the cross is

485
01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:53.370
our victory. When he says, pick up your cross and fall off, follow me. He's not saying suffer like

486
01:19:53.379 --> 01:20:00.250
me. He's saying be victorious like me. Can we say amen, be victorious like me,

487
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:08.520
be victorious like women, man, we've got enough suffering in this life. We know we're gonna suffer.

488
01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:15.649
He told us that we, we need to be prepared for that. I'm prepared, but I'm also ready for the

489
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.140
victory

490
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:23.729
and that cross doesn't just speak to me about the pain. It speaks to me about the power of the

491
01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:30.870
resurrection. And where is it in your life that you need that power? Can you start to declare that

492
01:20:30.879 --> 01:20:37.160
right now? Just just say it out loud. If you need to say it in your mind, if you need to take this

493
01:20:37.169 --> 01:20:42.729
moment and just say it, say it to God. See, I'm gonna carry this cross and I'm gonna be victorious.

494
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:51.080
Let's pray, father. Thank you for every person here. Thank you for the miraculous that you are doing

495
01:20:51.089 --> 01:20:57.750
in this place. Thank you for the miraculous that you were doing in every life. Thank you for the way

496
01:20:57.759 --> 01:21:03.879
that you are showing us and teaching us and telling us what it is that we need to understand. So the

497
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:10.609
stories of your word just make sense and are powerful to bring about change in our lives. Thank you

498
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:16.009
for who you are and what you've done. And today, Lord, we wanna come before you and we wanna say God

499
01:21:16.529 --> 01:21:22.899
perform the miraculous in our lives. Give us the breakthrough. We take up the cross of victory and

500
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:29.830
we come after you. Thank you for taking all of our rejection. Thank you for giving us the freedom.

501
01:21:29.839 --> 01:21:36.790
Thank you for delivering us. Thank you that today our life has been changed. Lord, we surrender to

502
01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:44.189
you, we obey you and we ask for the power of your word to give us the strength that we need to step

503
01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:52.509
out in the way that you are asking us to. And we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God

504
01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.779
bless you guys. Thank you so much. Hey, um

505
01:21:59.279 --> 01:22:04.169
there's a song that I asked the worship team um to sing at the end of the service because I really

506
01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:11.629
believe that um this is an, an anointed song that is um gonna anoint a powerful prayer over us. OK.

507
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:17.950
So I want you to hear the words because it's gonna speak powerfully over our lives right now and,

508
01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:24.890
and there's something that I want you to just respond to, um, just freely and naturally too. Ok. And

509
01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:32.319
that is that if you feel like God is telling you, um as this song is being sung to just come to the

510
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:38.790
front and pray, I want you to just have the courage and the faith to just get up and to walk. Can

511
01:22:38.799 --> 01:22:43.959
you say amen to that? Just to get up and to walk? And as the song is playing, you just, you're just

512
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:48.490
gonna do that, you're just gonna trust God, you're just gonna believe that that is what God is

513
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.700
asking you to do. There's gonna be a moment in the song. I know it. I know it. Well, God is going to

514
01:22:53.709 --> 01:23:00.399
speak directly to you and, and, and, and it's not because of the words, it's not because of the song.

515
01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:05.250
It's gonna be because of the presence of God that is gonna speak to your heart and he's gonna speak

516
01:23:05.259 --> 01:23:12.279
to your heart in such a way where you're gonna know that what you have to do is get up and you're

517
01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:17.129
going to have to pick up that map, whatever it is, whatever it looks like in your life and you're

518
01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:25.379
gonna have to walk and get up here to the front and it's an, it's an act of faith. Uh Listen the

519
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:31.470
same presence of God is, is there as it is here, there's nothing special is gonna happen here. OK? I

520
01:23:31.479 --> 01:23:39.580
just want you to know that. OK? The miracle is not waiting up here. OK? The miracle happens. When

521
01:23:39.589 --> 01:23:49.609
you respond to God, see it's you, your faith responding to God that produces the miracle. OK?

522
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:56.319
There's no special anything up here. It's the same special thing everywhere God is here. You know

523
01:23:56.330 --> 01:24:03.910
that. Right. Right. OK. So when we ask you to respond, it's because Jesus asked everybody to respond.

524
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:14.029
Iii I didn't learn this from me. I learned this from Jesus. Jesus told people to respond. He always

525
01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:20.509
asked them, what do you want me to do for you? It's not like you didn't know, but they had to say it,

526
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:27.109
you get it. We have to say it and when He tells you to get up and walk, we have to get up and walk

527
01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.740
because that's what he's asking us to do. So if He doesn't ask you to do it, don't do it. But if

528
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:36.129
He's, if you feel it and you know it, do it because something is gonna happen. That's where your

529
01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:44.419
breakthroughs happen. When you obey, not under compulsion, not under conviction, not under my

530
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:51.879
convincing, but you're responding to God. So please just do it. If God is the one doing it, amen. I,

531
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:59.279
I want these moments to be real. I want them to be authentic. You know, III I want them. I've seen a

532
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:06.430
lot of fake. I I'm done with the fake guys. Are you done with the fake? Please? Let's be done with

533
01:25:06.439 --> 01:25:11.779
it. There's a lot of fake happening in a lot of places and it looks real, it feels real but it's

534
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:19.790
still fake. Let's let's only do what's real and, and we're gonna see the real thing happen. Real

535
01:25:19.799 --> 01:25:26.169
breakthroughs. OK? We walk away, changed, we walk away, transformed.

536
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:31.310
So Lord, I pray that we respond to the real,

537
01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:40.640
that we respond to you. The only thing that's truly real in his life, that is eternal.

538
01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:49.709
You are the beginning and the end of all things. And I pray that right now God as we would just

539
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:59.339
worship the song, singing these words to do something powerful in us and in our lives. And we pray

540
01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:06.470
this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. All right, let's get ready. Let's get ready.

541
01:26:09.089 --> 01:26:16.819
Is called in Jesus name God of possible. And in Matthew 1926 it says looking at them, Jesus said

542
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:25.160
with men, it is impossible, but with God, all things are possible. Praise God. Let's sing these

543
01:26:25.169 --> 01:26:25.930
words together.

544
01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.779
I speak the name of Jesus all for you

545
01:26:48.959 --> 01:27:00.470
in your hurting, in your sorrow. I will ask my God, I speak the name because it's all can

546
01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:10.930
in desperation, I'll seek heaven and I'll pray this for you. Pray for y

547
01:27:13.209 --> 01:27:25.870
the circumstances were changed. I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus name. I pray for a

548
01:27:25.879 --> 01:27:30.120
breakthrough. What happened today?

549
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:36.459
I pray Mary calls over your life in Jesus.

550
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.390
Ok.

551
01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:52.149
A three name of all authorities

552
01:27:54.620 --> 01:28:03.270

Yeah,

I pray that

556
01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:26.799

557
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:38.140
I

558
01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:41.529
OK.

559
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.950
I pray for you here. Hey, you're sick is with,

560
01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.839
I pray that the fear would die, would flee

561
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.990
the

562
01:29:54.209 --> 01:29:55.049
I pray that

563
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.740
that

564
01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:26.669
first time.

565
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:43.040
And so we received those words over us today, Lord. And we thank you for putting your hand on these

566
01:30:43.049 --> 01:30:49.430
loved ones here up front ones who have stepped out and those who stepped out from where they are and

567
01:30:49.859 --> 01:30:59.080
where they stood and move towards you in the breakthrough that you have given them today. Thank you

568
01:30:59.089 --> 01:31:05.580
that when you told us all today to get up, we took the opportunity to listen to you and to obey you.

569
01:31:06.459 --> 01:31:13.689
And today we take up that cross and we follow you the cross of victory and we thank you for taking

570
01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:20.600
our rejection and giving us the power of the resurrection. Instead, I thank you for every person

571
01:31:20.609 --> 01:31:26.359
that is here today and the amazing things that you're going to do in their life and through it for

572
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:31.160
how things are going to be different, for how things are gonna change for how things will never be

573
01:31:31.169 --> 01:31:38.839
the same. We pray this in Jesus name today. Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

574
01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:39.479
Everyone.

575
01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:47.009
Hey. Um I just want to tell you that over the next few weeks, we're going to be in a new series

576
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:55.609
called, um Let there Be Joy. And this is a series that is gonna start next Sunday. How many of us

577
01:31:55.839 --> 01:32:03.669
have experienced the fleetingness of joy where it just leaves us over and over again. You know, that

578
01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.609
God has given us principles in His scriptures of how to experience joy every day of our life,

579
01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:15.640
regardless of our circumstances. And I think that since we're entering into a season of joy, how

580
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:22.649
about we experience the real thing, how about we live the real joy that God has to offer us. So,

581
01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:27.370
starting next week, we're gonna be starting a new series called Let there Be Joy. And so I hope you

582
01:32:27.379 --> 01:32:32.680
guys can be a part of that. God bless you. Enjoy the afterparty. We'll see you next Sunday.

583
01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.839
Thank you. I see.
