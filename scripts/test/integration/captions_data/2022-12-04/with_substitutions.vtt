00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.990
hot day and today it's winter again and to make sure that anybody that may have missed the Christmas

3
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:32.040
season. I was just there today wearing my Christmas blazer to remind you that we're in that

4
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:41.545
wonderful season of Christmas and good reason also to celebrate today in this house today, so

5
00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:46.905
really happy to be with you and there's a wonderful gathering prepared for you this morning, a

6
00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:54.895
special one. Also, our Dear Pastor Lorenzo is away this weekend, but he has prepared something for

7
00:07:54.895 --> 00:08:02.250
us and so stay with us for that special gathering today. So we just want to remind you also that if

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.780
you're new to that community, you can belong to that community even before you believe. So no matter

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:15.210
where you are in your faith journey, you're really welcome here and welcome to ask any question and

11
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:29.450
wonderful life that we have so far. Um also one of the last thing that I wanted to mention this

12
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:35.490
morning is if you want to stand up a little bit right now and because it's a little bit freezing

13
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.440
sometimes we have like some problem with our muscles and all of that, so we're gonna do some

14
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.230
stretching exercise. Okay, because okay, so just stretch one arm, just making sure everything's

15
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.515
moving perfect perfectly. Yeah, the other arm perfect. Maybe try to stand on one ft like this. Okay,

16
00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:56.475
try that. Okay, just to see the balance is everything is okay, working fine perfect. Because it's

17
00:08:56.475 --> 00:09:02.095
security is the other most important and just make sure you can clap and just making sure you're

18
00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:07.165
it's working. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. Okay, a little bit stronger. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Excellent.

19
00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:12.275
Perfect. Perfect. So you see in top shape for that first song, King of All,

20
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.310
Thank you johann introducing and getting us all up. This is a fun song called King of All from

21
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.280
Mosaic. Let's enjoy this song together.

22
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.220
Really

23
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.740
lips every month

24
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.160
everywhere.

25
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.310
I will declare that your

26
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:17.910
that's right.

27
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.040
Yeah,

28
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.380
he's our king. Um Yes,

29
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.810
through every desert. Your love makes a rip

30
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.910
and I feel the window

31
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.850
you

32
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:16.600
clinic.

33
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:45.410
So you understand now why it was important to stretch before that first song. So you may be seated.

34
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:51.900
So it's a little bit different in terms of, we were gonna do the gathering this morning. So we'll

35
00:14:51.900 --> 00:15:01.310
have a 15 minutes by video by Christina cummings with a personal life story and the title is joyful

36
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.710
expectation. So let's look, let's look at that video right now. Thank you.

37
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:16.580
Hi, I'm Kristina. Um some of you might know me at church. Um if you don't know me, I want to talk a

38
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:23.370
little bit about my story and just kind of share a little bit of my journey with the phrase joyful

39
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:31.800
expectation and what that means in my walk with Christ. So right after I was saved. I was 18, I was

40
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:41.850
a baby and I had a spinal cord injury like immediately after, maybe a year after and um the entire

41
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:48.640
year was just me starting from ground zero and it was like, I lost pretty much everything, I lost my

42
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.830
friends, I lost the chance to work and study and all the things that you want to do as an 18 year

43
00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:01.140
old and I was actually 19 by that point. Um and it was like, boom, my spine was shattered, I

44
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:06.840
shattered my L1 and L2 vertebrae, I cracked every other vertebrae. My spine was dislocated

45
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.540
like completely and I just felt like, you know, I bruised my spinal cord, I had to relearn how to

46
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:19.060
walk and I had to relearn how to um live my life, how to clothe myself, how to take a shower and I

47
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:27.370
got to a place where I had come so low that I had no um no idea how to get out of that season and I

48
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:34.180
was just kind of running, I was trying to like, as the meds would wear off, I would start to feel

49
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:40.690
more emotional pain and I would start to feel more angry at God and I would start to feel like I um

50
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:48.450
was going nowhere, I'd feel more hopeless, I would feel more despair um and I didn't know how to get

51
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:56.590
all my goal was to get out of that season and just run and because of that, it was like every day I

52
00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:03.550
would fight my feelings, I would push them away. I would um I didn't have any hope, but I was

53
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.730
focused on something that didn't have anything to do with God. I just was mad at him and I was

54
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.620
ignoring that and I was just trying to get out of the season and run towards what I thought I wanted

55
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:20.110
and I got to the place where um I couldn't run anymore. Like I was so crippled by the way of my pain

56
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.150
that I kind of just fell on my knees one day during outpatient rehab. Um I was in florida, I was

57
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:34.590
limping on the beach. My limp was like so big and I had my brace and I just felt the pain kind of

58
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.550
cut through me like a razor blade and I just fell on my knees and I was, I couldn't see anything

59
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.220
because I had started to cry. I just couldn't run from it anymore. And because of that, it was like,

60
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:51.100
boom, I immediately felt like I just gave everything to God in that moment. I couldn't change what

61
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.410
had happened and I couldn't change the fact that I just couldn't get out of the season on my own and

62
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:01.400
I had no idea where I was going and I had no idea, you know what the future looked like. Um and if

63
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.140
any of the desires or dreams of my heart, we're going to come to pass, I didn't even know what was

64
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:14.220
gonna happen, I had just fallen so far and that was when I think that was the moment. I genuinely

65
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:20.700
felt like if I reached out my hand, like Jesus was literally reaching back and holding it, like I

66
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:28.340
felt so close to him and from that day on it was like, he carried me, like I just said, okay God,

67
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.500
you're gonna get me out of bed, I'm not if I'm gonna get out of bed today and I'm gonna face this

68
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.520
day, you're gonna take me out of bed, like you're gonna get me out. And I felt like he was telling

69
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.310
me, you can't look far ahead, you can't look at the next day, you can't even look at tomorrow, like,

70
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.280
just look at today, like you stay in the grace for today and I'm gonna carry you through this day

71
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:54.480
and then tomorrow I'm gonna carry you through the next day. And so I, my expectation moved from

72
00:18:54.490 --> 00:19:00.580
nothing to just trying to get out of the season and run towards things that I thought I wanted to

73
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:09.960
Jesus, it was like the needle kind of just moved to like, Jesus is my hope, like Jesus is where my

74
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:16.780
expectation comes from, like he's my living hope he's the one, I'm following and um and that's

75
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.220
it. I have nothing else. You know, all my friends had moved on with their lives, I'm in the middle

76
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:27.030
of nowhere, like I was just me and my mom because I couldn't live independently at that time and I

77
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:33.190
just had nothing to get me out of that out of bed each day and move through that season and I didn't

78
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.150
know when it was going to end or where I was going to go after that, so it's like literally when

79
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.840
everything is lost and everything that you're hoping for um or everything falls apart, It's like,

80
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:50.610
who do you hold on to? And I genuinely had no other option but to grab onto him and it changed my

81
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:59.970
life because I discovered who he was apart from what I had, you know, grown up hearing about him and

82
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:05.550
from what people would tell me their experience was of him and you know, I thought he was kind of

83
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:11.450
just this big guy in the sky, it was like, he suddenly became real and he became so intimate and

84
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.810
everywhere it was like, he was just became so much bigger than I realized and you know, after that

85
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.690
season I did come out of that season, um my spinal cord was still bruised, so there's stuff that has

86
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.520
changed forever in my body, but my bones healed and I was able to run again and I was able to do

87
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.430
things even if I can't do, you know, everything that I thought, but it's like his love was what

88
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.950
strengthened me in that season. Um it wasn't just the healing from the, like the medicine and all of

89
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:44.860
that stuff was, was needed and necessary, but ultimately like his love is what healed me and

90
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:51.030
strengthened me and I think it carried me because only a couple of years later, I fell right back

91
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:57.330
into a chronic illness, like a whole other set of, you know, um like this was a seven year chronic

92
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:03.030
illness that started only two years after my spinal cord injury and and that I don't think I would

93
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:10.180
have had the tools to face any of that had I not walked through my injury, because when I walked,

94
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:16.340
when I began, my body started to break down and we didn't know why. Um and it had nothing to do with

95
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.820
the injury. So that was another mystery. And when that happened, it was like, I knew God was good,

96
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:28.860
so that was what made it more frustrating and, and this time I really felt like I have no idea if

97
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.080
there's a light at the end of the tunnel. So I think with my spinal cord injury, it was like,

98
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:40.250
there's, you know, I know at some point I'm gonna have my, I'm gonna get my second surgery, they're

99
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.000
gonna take the rod out of my back and I'm going to be walking at some point, I don't know what it's

100
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.480
gonna look like, but I had some hope, but not so much and then I began to discover who God was and

101
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.740
then knowing who he was and tasting who he was and starting to see so much fruit in my life. Then I

102
00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:01.230
find myself walking into a whole other wilderness on another level where I genuinely don't see a

103
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.820
light at the end of the tunnel. You know what do you do when every single year you are taking

104
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:10.320
medication and you're trying your best, you're seeing all these doctors and it's such a mystery and

105
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.270
every year you're doing everything you possibly can. I remember, I would sit at my parents house um

106
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.990
you know I would visit them, I would sit out, stare out the window and I would be looking at this at

107
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.680
the scene of just snow on their backyard and it would be really beautiful and I would feel so sick

108
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.900
and really sad. But something inside of me was like okay, you know, next year is gonna be better

109
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.260
because I'm gonna I'm gonna heal from this like it's gonna be over tomorrow, like you just think

110
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.560
it's just gonna be over. I'm not going to have to deal with this for as long as I think as long as

111
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:46.970
it might be and the next year I'm sitting there I find myself back in my parents house to see my

112
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:53.320
doctor and my body is sicker than it was the last time and I'm staring out and I remember just

113
00:22:53.320 --> 00:23:00.340
thinking whoa I am staring at the exact same, you know the exact same situation out my window, the

114
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:06.810
exact same image with snow on the ground on my parents backyard one year later and my body has not

115
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:14.270
changed, it's actually gotten worse. Like what do you do in that place? Um when and you know God is

116
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:20.930
good. I think that that really got me. It was hard, it was like how can I reconcile that? This just

117
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.960
does not seem like anything is happening in the physical, like it just looks like nothing's changed

118
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:32.880
or it's getting worse. And that's when God really took me on a journey of understanding what he does

119
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:38.350
underneath the surface. Like what does he what is, you know the fact that God is always moving.

120
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:45.750
That's something I didn't understand um that he's always moving for my good, he's always moving,

121
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.190
he's always healing. It just might not look, I remember the day he told me I'm gonna have to I'm

122
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:56.880
gonna do a miracle in your heart before I ever do a miracle before your eyes. And that really got me

123
00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:06.100
because I was like, oh you're doing stuff I can't see, you know? And so because of that, I really

124
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:13.090
started to just have to learn to hold on to Jesus when you genuinely can't see anything around

125
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.270
everything, nothing makes sense. It was like how do I learn to stay faithful in the mystery. I

126
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.710
remember one day he told me to, you know if you stay faithful in the mystery, I will bring the

127
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:28.250
clarity like when the time is right, you will see it and I started to see pictures in my mind of

128
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:34.590
like orchards, like that's odd and then I felt like Holy Spirit was kind of just like this is this

129
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:40.620
is your life, like this is the fruit that is growing right now, like underneath the surface, the

130
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.260
roots that are going down so deep right now, you can't see it, you don't, you don't see any of this,

131
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:52.050
but this is the fruit that's gonna come out of this, it was like orchards and orchards, like I would

132
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:59.480
have dreams of just like orchards just like trees that were so big and so high and just so much

133
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:05.380
impact and love like pouring out of me because of how much love was pouring through me and how much

134
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:11.620
I was learning and all the tools that I'm gaining in my tool belt of just trusting the Lord and

135
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:17.260
trust is not a spiritual gift, so it's not something that just like, you know, you have it when you

136
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:24.150
are saved or something like that, like trust is a fruit and fruit grows intention and so in those

137
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:31.180
seasons when the fruit of trust is growing, that's when you need and I learned this like, oh I, I,

138
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:37.370
my hope genuinely has to be in Jesus and I have to, you know figure out like what does it look like

139
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:44.050
to worship him in this place um when I don't see a miracle, like I don't see anything and I don't

140
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.680
know when that will happen, you know, and so he took me on that journey and if you're in that place,

141
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:55.570
I want to encourage you because at the end of the day, like if you choose to worship him here um

142
00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:01.370
worship is going to carry you through this season, one that carried me through this season and if

143
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:06.570
you choose to worship him here, I promise you, you are giving him a gift, you can never give him in

144
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:12.270
heaven in heaven, every tear is wiped away, like there's no pain, there's no suffering, right? And

145
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:19.550
so this is the season, this is a gift, you can only give God now you can't give it to him in heaven

146
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:27.260
when everything is falling apart around you and all you can do is choose to still worship him, how

147
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:33.040
to expect goodness and mercy to come to you one goodness and mercy, this is something I had to, I

148
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.990
had to remind myself every day, I had to prophesy to myself, goodness and mercy are chasing me down

149
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.670
right now, like there's that verse that goodness and mercy are following you all the days of your

150
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:50.920
life basically and I had that became real for me, it's like I realized, whoa! Like this is the

151
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:56.670
season where I can choose to believe that when nothing around me looks that way, I can choose to say,

152
00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:03.450
okay, you know what? Nothing around me looks good right now I am in so much pain. Um and I'm in a

153
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:09.310
mystery, I'm in a complete and total fog, but I'm gonna choose to believe that goodness and mercy

154
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:14.990
are following me, like they're chasing me down and I'm gonna choose to believe that there are gifts

155
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:20.050
for me in this season that I cannot get in any other season. I can't get them any other way. I read

156
00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:25.180
a book called kisses from a Good God and it came to me in a season when I was really frustrated with

157
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.870
God and I was so confused, it was like maybe five years into the illness or four or five when I

158
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:36.220
really was like, the sickest I ever was and I was so mad at him and confused and all this pain was

159
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:43.180
coming up emotionally just because he wasn't moving the way I thought he would and I felt like he

160
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.680
was like, I got that book in the mail right at the moment when I was breaking down and I was like,

161
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:53.310
okay, I did not time that I ordered the book like weeks ago, not thinking. And and it came that

162
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.270
exact moment, like the amazon delivery guy, like knocked on my door the moment I'm having a

163
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:05.200
breakdown, like so angry at God, so frustrated and just finally being real with him. Like I finally

164
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:12.690
was just like, okay, I'm done, I'm done hiding my frustration, I'm just going to let it out and I

165
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.840
was letting him have it and in that moment like that, you know, the delivery guy dropped off the

166
00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:22.850
book, I looked at the title and it said kisses from a good God and I just broke down crying and I

167
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:28.450
felt him hold me in that moment and I felt him cry with me. It was like, I felt like I could feel

168
00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:36.170
his tears fall on me and I just I don't even know how to describe that experience, but it was like,

169
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:41.470
I realized, well he's with me in this valley, like and he's and I can be real with him, I can tell

170
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:46.510
him I'm frustrated, like I remember Jesus told me you can make me your punching bag, you know, like

171
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.530
don't make yourself your punching bag, don't make other people like make me I took it, that's why I

172
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:55.760
went to the cross like I can take it and I had to be real with him, I had to yell at him, I had to

173
00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.880
get angry, I had to get honest and frustrated to get to the place where I could grieve, I could

174
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.890
grieve that my season doesn't look the way I thought it would, it doesn't feel like I thought it

175
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:12.110
would, it didn't end when I thought it would, and God isn't moving how I thought he would,

176
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.380
nothing was happening the way I wanted it to or thought it would be that way. And so it was like I

177
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:26.100
had to get to the place where I just let myself grieve and you can't grieve without first letting

178
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:31.530
yourself feel the emotions that are coming to the surface. So for me it was anger and frustration

179
00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:36.760
and I had to do that every day. I thought of myself as like a buoy where like every day I'm trying

180
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.620
to stay afloat. But if I've got like heaviness inside that buoy and I've got like all this gunk of

181
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:47.580
pain and anger and frustration and confusion and I'm not choosing to let it out. I'm gonna start

182
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:52.050
thinking. So I had to learn like what does it look like? You know those things on like buoys,

183
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.380
they've got that little opening and you can open it and fill it up with air. So I felt like I

184
00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:01.570
envisioned myself every day just having that buoy floating on the water and what does it look like

185
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:06.680
to release what I'm feeling to Lord bring it to him And be honest, if I'm angry at him, I'm

186
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:12.590
frustrated, I'm confused, angry at myself, angry at other people, not just angry, but all the

187
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:18.710
emotions disappointed. Like things that we try to pretend we're not feeling like just letting that

188
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.530
out and then letting myself feel the sadness. What does it look like to bring that all to his feet

189
00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:28.880
and feel it and feel it with him and find him in that. And that's when I believe God could close it

190
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:36.060
back up, fill me back up with air fill me back up with joy, peace, hope, patience and also just that

191
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:42.210
hope, that expectation and belief that he is bringing me somewhere. I don't know where he's bringing

192
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:48.000
me, but he is moving beneath the surface. He could fill me back up with that and then I could keep

193
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.410
floating and I had to do that every day and some days were harder than others. So if you're in a

194
00:30:53.410 --> 00:31:00.070
season like that, take this as your own, take these tools, take this um bring this to God in your

195
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:06.510
walk with him and figure out what it looks like for you to just be real with him and release what

196
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:10.950
you're feeling at his feet and let him fill you back up and let him speak words over you because

197
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.820
he's standing in your future right now. He's standing in the places you're going to go and he's

198
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:21.950
telling you what he wants to tell you what he sees. So ask him for words from that place, from where

199
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.290
he's taking you that you can hold onto and those prophecies, those prophecies can be what you stand

200
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.080
on, whether it's something in the Bible or a word that a friend gives us encouragement or something.

201
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.420
He speaks to you directly in your ear like however it is God's always speaking and his words will

202
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.400
carry you through this season and his love will be what heals you so that you can continue to stay

203
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:49.400
afloat and believe and have that joy have the joy that strengthens you through this pain because joy

204
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:55.770
is not happiness. I find that joy actually is strength. It gives you strength to move through this

205
00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:02.080
season and come out the other side. So that way you can have joyful expectation in what God is doing

206
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.190
in your life right now.

207
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.050
Me

208
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:22.320
Well, if you never had that that opportunity and to test God in the midst of the difficulties that

209
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:30.180
you may, you may have, like enter in your room privately asked him to hold your hand, just raising

210
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:36.650
your hand and asking him to really hold you in that difficult situation and it will step into your

211
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:43.610
life in a way that you'll never experiment before. So that's really something extremely strong and

212
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:50.180
that reminds me also of a wonderful image also of like two person that was walking walking on the

213
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:59.300
beach, God and that person and then eventually in the step in the sun we're seeing only one pair of

214
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:06.310
people walking on the beach and then the person was talking to God saying, hey you see you, you told

215
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:13.510
me you'll always be with me And at that moment there was only one pair of footsteps walking. So

216
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:19.360
where were you? And obviously in that wonderful story, as Christina told us, he was saying I was

217
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.240
carrying you, I was there, I was carrying you. So let's stand up and sing together.

218
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:33.810
This song is about the goodness of God like Christina had said the goodness of God and mercy is

219
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:38.720
falling, the Lord is running after us to give us the goodness.

220
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.340
So let's sing about the goodness of God.

221
00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.150
that way.

222
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.050
That's the guy

223
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.730
you have

224
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.430

225
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.000
no you as a

226
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:38.360
that's the guy,

227
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.180
let's sing this,

228
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.510
thank you for your faithfulness.

229
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.390
Safe.

230
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:36.060
Are you ready to sing a Christmas song? This song is called Messiah. It's gonna be our 1st Christmas

231
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.170
song of the season.

232
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.590
Listen to the words sing them with your heart

233
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.320

252
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:32.260

That's a really nice Sunday and also um really, what's the word for that? Dooby obedience or just

255
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:58.850
better than google everyone, clap your hands for everyone here. Okay, so that is on Sunday next

256
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:04.270
Sunday. Please don't forget that there is also hot chocolate outreach that will happen Saturday

260
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:37.120
make sure you attend to that gathering and spread the word about also that wonderful Sunday where

261
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:43.400
there will be another meal served by the community kitchen. Really excited about that we wished and

262
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:49.720
we were really longing from that reopening of that ministry and we had like many already many events

263
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:57.540
for for the community kitchen this year and that's a really wonderful news Christmas Eve, Christmas

264
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:05.410
eve, something extremely important, I wasn't aware of that, but each element years Sundays Christmas

265
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:13.420
eve and also, so what's the word for the Christmas eve will take place Saturday at five, oh no, I'm

266
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:20.400
sorry about mixing the announcement, but yeah, New Year's, so Christmas day and New Year Day are

267
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:28.090
coming both on a Sunday, okay, so and it's happening only once every 11 years, so apparently this is

268
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:33.890
the year where this is happening, so there will be a gathering but it will be online gathering, okay,

269
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:41.630
so there will be no no gathering in this space, so make sure to attend virtually to that gathering,

270
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:49.060
but each 11 years apparently it's happening. So this is the year for that simultaneous event

271
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:55.800
happening. So talking about Christmas eve, uh there will be a gathering, Saturday December 24th at

272
00:44:55.810 --> 00:45:05.200
five p.m. Here, it will be one hour gathering, so be there, so a lot of announcement this morning,

273
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:11.710
so maybe just do just a little checking to the colleague or the person the neighbor at your right,

274
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:18.150
just making sure that he's not snoring or is still alive. So yeah, because there's, I still have

275
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:26.000
three pages of announcement, so okay, just to be sure, okay, so there's four ways to give as usual

276
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.720
and we really want to encourage you in that season of generosity to continue to support our

277
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:38.580
community, that's really something really important, don't forget also and eventually we could, we

278
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:45.290
will share some information about that, but for those of you who are doing income tax report. When

279
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:53.910
you give, When you give to a community like ours that is registered organization, you're eligible

280
00:45:53.910 --> 00:46:03.340
for a tax credit. So um and it's it's kind of important depending of the value that you're giving

281
00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:13.580
but more than $200, the credit that you can receive is almost 1550% 55 0%. So and nice season to do

282
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:19.900
that because when you're gonna do your tax report, the credit could happen like sometimes somewhere

283
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:25.700
in March or April. So consider giving to that community to sustain all the different activities. We

284
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:31.780
really really appreciate your support after party. Make sure to be to be there. There will be a

285
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:42.420
treat and um treat and also hot chocolate and coffee serve. And finally let's watch that video while

286
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.520
we're dismissing the kids. So let's take a look at that.

287
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:29.950
Okay, so sleeping tests. You're still there. Yeah. Really awake. Perfect. So let's welcome virtually

288
00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:35.900
on video Lorenzo but it's not live. Okay. So but she just has an encouragement. So let's welcome

289
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:42.690
Lorenzo for that message that he has prepared for us every good gift. So let's welcome him.

290
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:27.270
I pray that this has been a blessing so far and that God's word would continue to speak to our hearts

291
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:32.960
and illuminate our lives and I believe that that's what God's word does when we turn our attention to

292
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:39.070
it. You know prayer is amazing. God answers our prayers and when we pray to God, we often pray to

293
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:44.480
him in our own words and that's exactly what God wants. But it's important for us to also learn how

294
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:51.520
to pray from the scriptures. And one of the verses that I believe can help us to navigate through

295
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:56.710
those difficult challenges that we're dealing with today and what we may be dealing with in the days

296
00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:03.480
to come is this verse that is found in James chapter one and in James chapter one and in verse 17 it

297
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:10.660
says that every good and perfect gift comes down from the father who created all the lights in the

298
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.920
heavens and he is always the same. And he never makes dark shadows by changing. Every good and

299
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:22.790
perfect gift comes down from the father who created all the lights in the heavens and he is always

300
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:31.280
the same and never makes dark shadows by changing. Now, I may not feel like God is giving us that,

301
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.780
which is good and perfect, especially this time of year after the difficulties you've encountered.

302
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:45.230
But if you believe in a God who is a God that can be trusted God that James describes as someone who

303
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:50.460
doesn't cast any dark shadows, who's never changing and normally knows how to give good and perfect

304
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:56.050
gifts, then that's the way that we need to approach the circumstances in our lives as we go through

305
00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:01.060
them. We're not denying what's happening, but we are also anticipating that God is going to turn

306
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:08.110
things around on our behalf and that what we see isn't the end of the story, it is just a moment in

307
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:16.710
it and that we are being prepared by God to experience the turnaround to come back the overcoming of

308
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:23.140
the obstacle that is before us and the victory that he has already promised us. And so if you can

309
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:28.570
anticipate that both in your thoughts and in your hearts and in your prayers, I know that you are

310
00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:34.650
going to be able to live out this promise and receive every good and perfect gift from above. Now,

311
00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:40.170
the story that we are looking at it of course is the Christmas story. And if you think of Mary

312
00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:46.570
receiving the news from the Angel Gabriel that she was going to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit and

313
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:53.270
be able to bring into the world the Savior, the Messiah, the promised one. You can imagine that that

314
00:50:53.270 --> 00:51:00.980
did not seem like a good and perfect gift. You can imagine that when the angel appeared to Joseph to

315
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:09.000
talk him out of divorcing Mary, that that didn't seem like a gift for him either when the census

316
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.110
came about and they had to leave their hometown and go into Bethlehem while she was pregnant and so

317
00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:22.640
close to giving birth at a time in which everybody was traveling and it would have been difficult to

318
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:29.970
find any place um to be able to deliver this baby. I don't think that was seen as a good and perfect

319
00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:36.340
gift, but God was working out all things, wasn't he? I mean he was making sure that that Mary didn't

320
00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:43.860
give up and turn away from the promise that she was going to be the fulfillment of, by ushering in

321
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:49.560
bringing in giving birth to the savior of the world and and God was going to make sure that that

322
00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:55.100
Joseph didn't give up on Mary and didn't give up on God either, that he would truly see this as a

323
00:51:55.110 --> 00:52:04.060
good perfect gift from him to Joseph as well. That even though they were having to travel that Going

324
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:09.870
back to the town was really all about fulfilling the prophecy that had been given thousands of years

325
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:16.260
prior. How important it was for Jesus to be the fulfillment of those promises and the Bible tells us

326
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:22.500
that there's over 333 promises that have been made regarding the birth of Jesus and his life, his

327
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:28.700
ministry, his death, his resurrection, his life is the fulfillment of all that God has spoken of the

328
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:34.920
story that we are looking at is a continuation of the story that began in the book of genesis and

329
00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:40.280
the story that is actually continuing in our lives today because that very same gift that was given

330
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:48.410
on that Christmas day is the same gift that is continuing to give us light and life today and it is

331
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:55.660
giving you life and light right now And so my encouragement to you would be to turn your attention

332
00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:01.800
to this God turn your attention to this, Jesus, turn your attention to this father who knows how to

333
00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:07.620
give every good and perfect gift and knows exactly what it is that you need this Christmas season

334
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:16.470
and is ready to give it to you in its time that is already appointed, that fulfills all things that

335
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.990
God has in store for you. So don't give up, this is not the time to do that. Don't give in, this is

336
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:31.070
not the time to do that. Don't become desperate unless you're desperate for more of God and and more

337
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:39.160
of his plan and more of his fulfillment and more of his gifts that come even in the midst of our

338
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:45.150
greatest challenges. And I pray that this season as challenging as has been and maybe as you've been

339
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:51.350
able to be grateful for so many parts of it and and and maybe even able to to celebrate so many

340
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:57.280
moments where you have seen firsthand God's gifts and his faithfulness that you can anticipate even

341
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:03.940
greater ones to come. I know that we sometimes think that we're not worthy and we sometimes believe

342
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:12.300
rightly that it's undeserved, but guess what we have to go by what God says and by what he sees and

343
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:18.110
he sees you as being worthy through Jesus, he sees you as being deserving through him. He sees you

344
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:25.160
as being the one who can receive those perfect gifts that are great for your life and can bless you

345
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:32.130
and bless so many in and around you. And so I want you to think of that God who is so faithful to

346
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:40.230
you right now and so able and so capable of moving powerfully in your life. And so father, we want

347
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:45.860
to pray right now that you would bring about your blessing in our lives. We thank you for your life

348
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:53.550
and we thank you for how you know how to give good and perfect gifts to us all. Thank you that you

349
00:54:53.550 --> 00:55:03.210
cast no shadow that you are never darkness. Thank you that you are never ever holding back from your

350
00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:11.340
sons and daughters. And you are telling us today in the same way that you did thousands of years ago

351
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:19.520
in the lives of Mary and Joseph, that you will give us exactly what it is that we need and this

352
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:26.200
world needs to we will trust you God, we will bless you God, we will thank you God and we will

353
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:34.340
continue to believe in you God. Even when it seems that it just doesn't make sense to us. We will

354
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:41.990
surrender to your goodness to your love and to the knowledge that you were going to do great things

355
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:51.940
in us and through us. And we thank you for Jesus for his life his birth. We thank you for his death

356
00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:59.190
and his resurrection for how he continues to lead us and bless us and continues to be the one who

357
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:06.200
brings your great gifts into our lives in Jesus name. We pray Amen

358
