00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:45.020
Oh, so high represent, how are you this morning? Good, Yeah, happy thanksgiving by the way, it's

2
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:53.290
thanksgiving. So we'll have a wonderful service altogether. So uh especially also today we're gonna

3
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:59.330
serve some hot meals also by the community kitchen. So really it's gonna be thanksgiving,

4
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:06.980
thanksgiving for uh way much more people uh than the one that are usually attending to our service.

5
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:16.180
So it's a really good uh thanksgiving Sunday that we have in perspective. So today, um Lorenzo is

6
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.430
away by the way and you will have, I don't know, it's certainly not the privilege, but you'll have

7
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.540
the pain to experience my english for a longer time than usual, so, but the good news and it's

8
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:35.960
another subject of giving thanks to God, is it usually happens only once a year. So that's really

9
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:43.020
good. Uh be encouraged by that, it's gonna be only once a year. Uh so, but seriously, we want to

10
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:49.570
wish you a really warm welcome. Can you appreciate the fact that the church is hot right now? It's,

11
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:56.870
it's fun, really, we appreciate that warm cozy, It's super fun. So yeah, thanks for the clapping and

12
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:04.050
it's gonna be like that all the rest of the year, especially in the summer, it's super hot down here.

13
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:11.790
Uh so we just want to remind you that you can belong to that community no matter where you are in

14
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:18.010
your spiritual journey and even if we're talking and taking some assumption about that you're

15
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:24.260
believing in God and talking about the scripture and this is maybe not uh total authority on your

16
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:31.980
life, we're totally understanding that, but we want you to be aware that you're welcome no matter

17
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:40.580
where you are in your spiritual journey. So that is extremely important for us for you to be feeling

18
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:47.020
super comfortable about that. And today we're gonna continue with our series a fresh start And

19
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:53.950
without further ado I will ask you to stand up for a minute. It's going to be a good opportunity to

praise God,

62
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:45.430
We're going to sing a new song today. Another Mosaic song. It's called the one and this song, it

63
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:52.750
talks about how the Lord would be our one and only that he will be all that we need and we don't

64
00:18:52.750 --> 00:19:00.510
want him to stop changing us and to be there for us every day. Let's sing these words. Take them to

65
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.890
heart

66
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:05.170
from

67
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.370
he called

68
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.430
to your prom to make me

69
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.700
change. No,

70
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.630
I'm stuck.

71
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.420
I can't see

72
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.870
none. Um,

73
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.240
let's sing this all together.

74
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.180
Thank you for being the one. Praise God, Hallelujah.

75
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:13.080
Wow. Thanks for that new song. Really appreciated. So, so happy to be with you this morning. Uh,

76
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:20.490
really on that thanksgiving, Sunday, uh, warm inside, a little bit cold outside and this morning

77
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:26.890
some announcement. So, uh, community kitchen. So we're gonna serve some hot meal at the end of the

78
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:34.210
gathering. Thanks again for also the community kitchen. Uh, volunteers Kathleen also is leading that

79
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:43.060
for us. It has been reopened a couple of weeks ago. Uh, it's our third meal served if I remember

80
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:49.840
correctly. So it's ministry and service that we wanted to offer to our community for a long time and

81
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:57.600
we're gaining some momentum with that service, that meal that's gonna be served today. So wonderful

82
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:04.920
opportunity and continue to spread the world, the word about the community kitchen being back

83
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:12.140
next week. Our guest speaker will be even so our very own, Yvonne Masella that has been serving in

84
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:18.630
that community for many, many years even is there this morning, so super nice. She's now in South

85
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:25.300
Africa. I just said that she's there and she's in South Africa. So that's the confusion that happens

86
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:34.500
frequently in my brain. She's living in South Africa Africa, visiting us for the next few weeks. So

87
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:41.430
we're will be really blessed to have her next week with us and the topic and the message will be

88
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:50.510
about restoration, a topic that even has been really experiencing uh, been serving also that

89
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:58.510
community and many other person uh, to help restore our lives. So I want to remember you also,

90
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:03.110
there's four ways to give. So if you want to support that community, the different ministries that

91
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:10.570
we're offering here, we really appreciate your financial support. Obviously if you're a newcomer and

92
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:18.300
your visit us don't feel threatened or in any way by that announcement and if you're coming for a

93
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:24.220
long date here, don't feel threatened either by that announcement. It's simply a reminder that we

94
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:33.490
live solely on donations and gifts. So if you want to subsidize or different activities, uh, please

95
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:40.820
consider one of these four ways to give after the gathering. We arriving also our after party. So it

96
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:47.120
will be a wonderful opportunity to have some treats and take a coffee and uh, and mingle together

97
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.750
and I said mingles, it's correct. Okay, perfect. I'm trying some new words like this sometimes, so

98
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:58.450
and I'm usually looking at the visual. So sometimes the change the faces change. So I know it's bad,

99
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:06.340
but when I'm really subtle and I'm really reading the audience, so that's my best q to not doing

100
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:13.390
some bad things. Uh, there's another special announcement. It's, and I'll ask Nathan to come join me

101
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:20.420
for a special announcement about worship night. Uh, that's going to be organized. So Nathan and his

102
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:27.790
wife, Samantha are taking care of the young adults group. So can you welcome Nathan this morning?

103
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:37.560
Good morning, everyone, you want to talk to us about this UTC event and what it is. UTC is going to

104
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:46.490
be our worship night, also known as United United. So my goal with this worship night is to get a

105
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:52.370
bunch of churches from all over Montreal to come together within our building and just worship God,

106
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:58.930
right? Because that's where we're called to come together as one to worship. And so it will be held

107
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:06.310
here at River's Edge on November 11th at seven p.m. And all is welcome everyone every age. So please

108
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:11.470
share, we're gonna have a facebook group. So come and follow. Follow the facebook group, make sure

109
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:16.930
to say you're going and invite friends, share it as much as possible. We wanna, I wanna pack this

110
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:24.000
place to the brim like no space to walk around, just everyone here and worshipping,.Thank you very

111
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.410
much guys appreciate it. So

112
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.770
really cool initiatives and the idea is really try to assemble a team of worship of a worshiper and

113
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:43.060
musician that coming from all different churches and assemble one worship team, uh, and under the

114
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:49.390
umbrella of uniting the church Wonderful event. So please write that in your calendar and don't miss

115
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:55.420
that opportunity. And so let's take a look at this little video that reminds that it is time for

116
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.070
kids to be dismissed. So video.

117
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:43.510
So kids, there's a program prepared for you. So you just need to go to the annex back here. So

118
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:50.870
please take that opportunity, uh, to go reach your classroom. And that's about it for the

119
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:58.550
announcement this morning. So are you still with me this morning? Yeah, good. Good. Um, so just

120
00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:05.270
before beginning, uh, there's a short bumper, we're still in our fresh start series. So let's look

121
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.280
at that bumper. And uh, we're gonna start in the next couple of minutes.

122
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:44.500
Oh, so as I explained at the beginning and some of you weren't there? Or dear Lorenzo is, uh, in a

123
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:54.480
place that is really sad and freezing place. He's in Los Angeles. Uh, so it's really hard and we're

124
00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:04.480
gonna pray for him right now. Okay. No, but seriously, uh, we sung a song from Mosaic. Uh, this is

125
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.260
the association that we're in the midst of being, being part of, and uh, there's an event, an annual

126
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:17.230
event that they're organizing and some members of the commune Are attending to that event and

127
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:23.400
Lorenzo is there. So it's gonna be finished, I think at noon and they're going to come back. So pray

128
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:30.570
for a safe trip back, but not for the weather there. It's 30 something. So it's pretty good on that

129
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:38.450
side. Yes. So, um, that's the reason why I'm there this morning and it's a real privilege to be with

130
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:45.660
you. Uh, it's usually an annual occasion. And you'll understand after that, I'll finish the message

131
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:55.120
why it's okay to be only once a year because otherwise you'll suffer too much and you will no longer

132
00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.960
attend to that community. And having me doing the message is also, there's another purpose, you know,

133
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.550
Lorenzo is really a bright guy. So he's saying by having you on once a year, they will, the

134
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:14.270
community will be able to pay appreciate me greater. So that's another trick also. So, so it's all

135
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:20.470
part of the plan. And so thank you for still being there. And for those that are at home, please

136
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:29.480
don't change another Youtube channel please. Okay, so as I mentioned, we're still in our Fresh start

137
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:38.260
series. Fresh Start is about revisiting our past to be able to better live our future. So that's

138
00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:45.990
what this series is about. And the topic of next week, also restoration will be, will be touching

139
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:53.710
also that past that we want to revisit and be able to obtain restoration. And today is the, is the

140
00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:01.730
theme is really about regaining or being calm and and when I look at my past and I don't know if

141
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:08.540
it's the same for you and I, and sometimes I will try to do some to probe you from some little

142
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:17.460
survey maison - house survey. But if it is the same when I'm looking at my past, one thing that I found

143
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:28.210
is that my journey as not necessarily be slow and steady and plateau kind of life. It has been built

144
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:38.540
from moment with highs and lows and also some plateaus and obviously punctuated with life events

145
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:46.860
that were um sometimes really positive and other times that were some kind of a threat and really

146
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.450
difficult. So when I look at my past, you can imagine and I don't know if it's the same for you.

147
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:58.480
It's not like a long steady line. It's punctuated with events and there is some kind of a

148
00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:09.460
growth I think. I don't think I achieve anything. I wouldn't be like so uh so uh... Pas bold, but

149
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:16.120
audacious to say that I've achieved something. But I think I'm globally a little

150
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:23.790
better person than I was maybe 30 years ago, 15 years ago or 10 years ago. And and so that's that's

151
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:30.200
my life journey. But to be able and and do you have like some kind of similar life journey with high

152
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:37.170
lows or just a steady line with just thriving. Success after success. Just yes, I see yes, all the

153
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:44.550
place. So great. That message is not for you Great. You can go right now to the coffee, let's enjoy,

154
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:52.170
but for those of you. So I am low and and and sometimes we're not choosing what is happening in our

155
00:34:52.170 --> 00:35:02.210
life. And these events are sometimes also generating some anxious nous, some some fear, some stress

156
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:09.260
and and and worries as well. When we're in the midst of that, of these events and when we're looking

157
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:16.240
back revisiting the past, we're seeing also that in these events we've been able to achieve some

158
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:22.390
growth. Do you see that painful events in your life? That when you get out of that and it could be a

159
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:28.270
long period also. But when you get out of that, there's a lesson in that there's some kind of wisdom

160
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.650
and you've been able to grow, have you seen anything like that if you live something like this? Yeah.

161
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:43.200
So that's really unfortunate because apparently growth is some kind sometimes achieve through pain

162
00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:49.710
through through difficult events and with difficult event brings the stress, the worries, the

163
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:55.610
anxiety and all of that. So that's really unfortunate because if life was only about experimenting

164
00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:03.650
joy and growth was really only because only coming from slow and steady increase, there will be no

165
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:10.470
problem, no challenge dealing with our worries and our stress and all of that because we would

166
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:15.920
achieve growth just by being happy and going with a slow and steady mode. And this is not the

167
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.840
situation also one of the things that is super important is that we're living in a world, I don't

168
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:28.330
know if you've heard about the the expression the VUCA world. It's some it's some kind of an

169
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:37.200
expression that is referring to the most in the world that we're living that is really highly

170
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:49.300
volatile. The v standing for volatility in the world. The U. For uncertainties dc uh standing for uh

171
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:58.990
uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. So volatility, uncertainties, complexities ambiguity. And as

172
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:07.840
we develop as a human society, there is more and more of that vodka world. And and we're being being

173
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:15.130
more entangled with what is happening in the rest of the world. And we're living that world of

174
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:22.030
increasing complexities ambiguity and all of that. So not only we achieve growth to pain process and

175
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:32.000
to some challenge into our lives and and and and and we need to deal with worries and stress and

176
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.050
anxiety and all of that, but the world around us is making us and generates in us some worries, some

177
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:47.210
anxiety and some stress as well. So for instance, obviously the pandemic that has not been like

178
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:54.830
super good on the mental health nous. So for pandemic has been really super positive by raising the

179
00:37:54.830 --> 00:38:03.320
end on your mental health nets not really a lot of hands raising so generated a lot of problematic

180
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:10.240
and dealing with ourselves sometimes also dealing with the husband and the wife that you were happy

181
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.910
to not seeing that often and now that you're seeing more frequently. Same thing with the kids and

182
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:25.120
all of these situations and and so it took a toll on us. So that's really the situation we're living

183
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:33.420
in right now and it takes it and it it took a toll on us. And on statistics, statistics, Canada did

184
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:39.200
a survey recently uh, and and eventually we'll be able to show you the slide about that. But

185
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:46.830
basically it's quite simple. The status cic that has been done really mentioned that for coming from

186
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:57.210
2020 to 2022 The overall mental health nous of the Canadian decreased from 2020 to 2022 according to

187
00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:04.290
Auto survey that people were doing. So that old situation that we're living in right now in the

188
00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:09.830
different events in our life is really something that we are all struggling with and that we're not

189
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:17.540
alone with that situation, Especially also from the the age group of 18-34 years old, that group is

190
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:25.210
really uh more challenged by the situation because what we're seeing that in that surveys that only

191
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:33.780
50% of these persons of this age group is saying that is having like an appropriate mental illness.

192
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:43.060
So 50 other percent is really struggling with the appropriate balance. So today's message is really

193
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:49.900
about how do we keep calm in these situations? How do we keep calm with these events that are

194
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:57.470
happening that we know that will generate growth in our lives, but that we able to pass that

195
00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:06.690
situation without struggling and without also uh suffering too much in that uh in that period. So

196
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.410
does it Is it okay in terms of topics for this morning really to to explore together? How do we keep

197
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:21.000
calm in difficult situation? Yeah. Yeah, it's okay because I have another topics we can do a recipe

198
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.900
for charcoal breast chicken. So that's something that I've prepared. Yeah. So brian is willing for

199
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:37.720
that second one. So it's kind of like a message today. Okay. Mhm. So about that um one of the key

200
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:52.570
one of them Amazon did 2014 released what was the most highlighted passage in the Kindle

201
00:40:52.570 --> 00:41:00.700
e-books. So in their platform Kindle, all the e-books. So they released what was the most highlighted

202
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:08.050
passage in all the books? The most highlighted passage was coming from, which book do you think?

203
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:20.010
Yeah "Sept Jours", I've heard "Sept Jours," which is a revue québécoise. No, it's not that. The Bible, exactly. No, it wasn't coming from "Sept Jours."

204
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:28.740
It was really coming from the Bible. And that passage, what it was covering essentially is a

205
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:37.770
passage about how coping and dealing with our worries. It's a passage in Philippians uh chapter four

206
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:48.620
verse 6-8. And it really teaches us a recipe to keep calm in difficult situation. So that passage

207
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:55.620
usually is appearing in front. But I'll read it to you right now Just to make sure that you know

208
00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:04.300
what I'm talking about. And so that passage goes like this. So Philippians 4428. Always be full of

209
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:10.940
joy in the Lord. That's a classic passage that we've heard. And and and we'll deconstruct that after

210
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:16.120
because think about the context. Also. We're talking about pain and difficulties in our life

211
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:24.440
experiencing some kind of sometimes disease, disease, any kind of divorce, difficulties. And then

212
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:31.740
we're reading that one of the key passage to help us cope with that situation start with rejoice,

213
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.390
which makes it doesn't make any sense. Okay,

214
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.620
alien or something or

215
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:50.130
completely disconnected. So let's let's oh, that's amazing. Great. I'm so happy. Thanks guys. Can

216
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.030
can we applause the super tech team?

217
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:01.000
Yeah, yeah,

218
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.030
let's applause another time.

219
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:15.030
Seriously, They're doing an amazing job Sunday after Sunday. So let me read it okay to you. So,

220
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:23.030
always be full of joy in the Lord. I say that again, rejoice and then don't worry about anything.

221
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:31.800
Instead pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done. Then you

222
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:39.060
will experience God's peace which exceed anything. We can understand his peace, will guard your

223
00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:46.520
hearts and minds as you live in, Jesus Christ. And now dear Brothers and sister. One final thing.

224
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:56.480
Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable. Think

225
00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:04.350
about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. So that's the passage that I really want to

226
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:11.370
unfold with you this morning. And yeah, it's right there. It's just seek and I'd seek and I'd have

227
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:17.060
to play with the game so that they're playing with me this morning. I'll keep my call, I promise

228
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:27.520
hide and seek. So I really like that. I wasn't prepared for that. But so about that verse that is

229
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:35.580
really about keeping calm in our lives. Uh, there's a book that I've read a few years ago by max

230
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:42.630
Lucado that you can see at the next slide, that book by max Lucado is called anxious for nothing.

231
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.840
Okay. And that message also is greatly inspired from from that book. And another one also that you

232
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:56.740
see a little bit later. But there was a super interesting acronym in that book that I really

233
00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:05.140
reminded for the last years that I've read that book. So the acronym is calm. So that's really a

234
00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:13.740
good word to retain when you're in a state of worriedness or are anxious about something, express

235
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:23.730
experimenting some fear. So calm stands for celebrate. Ask leave and meditate. And where where do

236
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:29.720
you find that in the scripture? So, if we're coming back to the slide after after or before. The one

237
00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:37.640
that there was some yes, that's one. Thank you so much. So always be full of joy in the Lord really

238
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:46.060
refers to the rejoice part, celebrate. So the celebrate part is really where we find it in the verse

239
00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:54.510
to tell God what you tell God what you need. Is really afraid to the ask part. The thank him for all

240
00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:02.380
he has done is referring to the leave part. Okay, so when you ask the Lord then leave it to him and

241
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:10.590
thank him for everything he has done so far in the past. And then finally meditate. The m of calm

242
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:19.190
refers to think about the fix your thoughts and think about things that are good and beautiful and

243
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:27.090
pure and healthy for us. So that's basically what the acronym called stands for. So let's unfold

244
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:36.000
these like quickly this morning. So the first one calm uh in column is really standing for celebrate.

245
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:45.000
And as I mentioned previously, celebrating in the midst of painful events is totally unnatural. It

246
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.750
doesn't make any sense. So why should we force ourselves in the midst of experiencing pain and

247
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:59.920
anxious nous to celebrate God and why God and celebrate what? Exactly? Because we're experimenting

248
00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:07.400
pain doesn't make any sense. You don't have the heart to celebrate anything, you're really filled

249
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:15.820
with pain, sorrow with uh and stress sometimes. So why celebrating and celebrating what? And that

250
00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:22.920
celebrate part is really anchored in celebrating God's goodness, that independently of the

251
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:33.250
circumstances that we're living in God's good God's goodness never fails, never change over time. So

252
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:40.220
that's a solid anchor that we can have in our lives. So then why doing that exercise? To stretch

253
00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:49.880
yourself to reach for a celebration in our life. It's exactly to gain some perspective to be able to

254
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.020
see that there is still something that is working well. There is still someone that is, that has a

255
00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:03.190
plan and that is in control even if things appears to be totally out of control. So that beautiful

256
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:11.740
verse in lamentation says says this, yet I still there to hope when I remember this and look at what

257
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:20.640
Jeremiah is saying, I dare to hope because he's struggling. The faithful love of God never ends. His

258
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:30.120
mercies never sees great is faithfulness. His mercy began a fresh each morning and this is something

259
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:36.670
that I just want to pause. There were in the midst of a difficult events when you're waking up in

260
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:43.560
the morning, what is happening in your head? Is it all kind of a positive and beautiful thoughts and

261
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:50.360
you're at the heart of celebrating or if you're like me, there's a hamster that is just spinning 200

262
00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:55.480
MPH racing in all the different scenarios and all the problems and all the things you need to do in

263
00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:01.670
the day to be able to, so am I only the only one in that stage, Maybe I should go to the hospital

264
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:07.490
and that's okay. So only one person. Thank you brian, I name your name. Okay. 22 person. I won't

265
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:14.770
name your name. Perfect. So for the 21. So we'll continue, especially for you. For the others keep

266
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:21.520
going. Okay, seriously, we need to talk about after that. About seriously, I want to know how you're

267
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:27.160
doing that. That's great. But one of the discipline that I'm trying to do to to be able to celebrate

268
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:34.030
in the morning is really trying instead of filling my head already with all the different problems

269
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:41.860
and things that I need to fix is really to celebrate that his mercy is a fresh each morning. So I'm

270
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:49.900
experiencing his mercy once again and he's still there before ever starting my day. Having these

271
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:58.780
thoughts filling me out as I enter my day kind of and you'll see it's a succession in addition of

272
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:05.710
different things and tools that we can add to be able to cope with these difficulties that we have

273
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:11.170
in life. So this one is not the single one obviously. And it's not because you're gonna start your

274
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:17.600
day by saying, oh my God, I'm still alive, thank you God, I love you. And then if all the struggle

275
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.380
with stress and anxiety and all of that will will will be stopped. Obviously, it's not the case.

276
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:29.120
It's a discipline and it's an addition of different tools that we can implement in our life. So I

277
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:36.040
said to myself, the Lord is my inheritance. Therefore I will hope in him. The Lord is good and to

278
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:42.710
those who depends on him to those who search for him. So it is good to wait quietly for salvation

279
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:51.350
for the Lord from the Lord. So that part, even though it's extremely difficult. But it brings the

280
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:57.960
focus on something else than the current difficulties that we are experimenting. The next part is

281
00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:05.140
about asking And that asking part is the one that is probably the most obvious one because when

282
00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:13.130
we're experimenting the difficulties, sometimes we have the reflects to call God in the situation

283
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:20.400
but also where sometimes we could be also in a situation where we're just in some kind of a plateau

284
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:28.690
in our lives or just struggling. But it's we're struggling. So for so long time

285
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:39.010
for what? Hmm, I like that better. So it's water in that. So don't be worried. I want to be over

286
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:46.660
caffeinated this morning and the previous one was decaf So it's still okay. But still so yeah, so

287
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:54.080
we're no longer, we're no longer aware that we're struggling sometimes. And this is something that

288
00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:04.250
works to to to be think about this morning also is I'll talk for me also were cut in a situation for

289
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:11.880
a long time And in that situation we're even no longer praying about because it's kind of the new

290
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:19.100
normal. But still you're struggling. You're you're having some difficulties but it doesn't come to

291
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:25.810
my mind to ask: Hey Jesus, is this the life that you have in reserve for me? Is this the kind of life

292
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:32.890
that you want me to live in? And then sometimes it needs to have like a specific event to break that

293
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:38.540
and then we realized that oh my dear, what kind of life I was living for the last few months or last

294
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:46.970
few weeks. So the idea of ask is sometimes also yes, when we're experimenting difficulties to ask

295
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:54.090
help from God certainly. But there's also the part where in a situation where plateau a little bit

296
00:52:54.090 --> 00:53:01.160
in our lives and saying oh am I alone in that and not necessarily. Absolutely not. And we can ask

297
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:08.360
specifically God to help us to thrive back and to regain some kind of momentum in the situation and

298
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:18.880
happiness also. Uh if and that's good cue also too, see if we're experimenting a season a deserted

299
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:26.940
season, if you're if your happiness level, your energy level, if your relationship at different at

300
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:32.480
different part of your life, you are struggling and there's nothing on your prayers list about that,

301
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:38.800
You should add something about this and try to tackle something specifically and being specific is

302
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:45.120
extremely important. Not praying in general when Jesus was on earth, when he was asking people, what

303
00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:52.540
do you want me to do for you? That was the question of Jesus step. Oh really? What do you want

304
00:53:52.540 --> 00:54:02.700
specifically? And so being specific is extremely useful for what to see the hand of God in action.

305
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:09.730
So I do have a prayer register and I don't know if you're like me, but I tend to forgot maybe it's

306
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:19.050
another disease that I have also sickness. But even though I have my list of prayer pages and pages

307
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:26.820
of prayer topics when I enter in the difficult season, I tend to forgot everything that God has done

308
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:33.580
for me in the past years and really tough season and tough situation that God has helped me to

309
00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:43.390
overcome and I just suddenly alzheimer a new situation, oh God, what am I gonna do? It's catastrophe.

310
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:52.160
I'm on my own. It's over. What are the solution is a similar situation even worse and still not

311
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:58.410
remembering that. So I think that prayer register is something really helpful for me to ground a

312
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:05.750
little bit myself in terms of what God has done in the past and also the there's many promises in

313
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:13.950
the Bible that we can claim for us and pray about that more specifically. So we talk about the

314
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:20.710
celebration part to celebrate part, the ask part, let's go to the leave part and the leave part is

315
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:28.190
extremely important. And if you're going to the next slide, you'll see one wonderful passage in one

316
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:39.230
Peter 57. Give all the next one please leave. So it's Philippine. So not that I was ever in need for,

317
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:46.770
I have learned how to be content with whatever I add, I know how to live on almost nothing or with

318
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:52.660
everything I have learned the secret of living in every situation whether it is with a full stomach

319
00:55:52.670 --> 00:56:00.000
or empty with plenty or little for I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength. So

320
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:06.460
that's a wonderful passage about contentment, not another one and all these elements that we're

321
00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:12.450
looking this morning. There's none of them that are easy to apply. And as I mentioned, it's kind of

322
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:18.720
implemented implementing one of these in our lives at different circumstances, in different

323
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:26.670
circumstances and building an habit it out of that. But the leave part is so important because yes, we

324
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:34.800
we create that distance with our problem by celebrating God and then we ask God to intervene and

325
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:44.380
then I'll talk for me. I'll ask them. I I asked God, I pray and then I keep all my problems with me

326
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:52.860
as if I have never prayed God and I'm not expecting God to act in my life and I still carry on my

327
00:56:52.860 --> 00:57:00.800
shoulder the burden of the situation. So there's that part that is really important to uh to

328
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:10.260
maintain when we have that when we are in this kind of situation to leave our concern, our prayer

329
00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:20.540
request to God and really expect him to act in the situation and not ourselves acting as the same as

330
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:26.750
when we enter in the situation with all these problematic and the pressure that is on our shoulder

331
00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:35.340
and saying to God, I have celebrated you. I know that you can you are in control. I've asked you for

332
00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:43.110
that situation. Now I leave it to you and I will do my effort and I'll still do my best. But

333
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:49.720
ultimately I know that you're in control and I prayed for that. I leave it to you and and that

334
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:56.120
distance for me again is extremely important to create because otherwise I'm the only one that is

335
00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:03.440
still in control and I keep that, it's like, God is a fallback plan, okay? It becomes like the

336
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:12.200
situation not the ideal situation. So it's just one tools in my in my in my toolbox, God is the

337
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:18.840
ultimate tools. And when we pray for a specific subject, we should leave it to him and not carry him,

338
00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:26.240
carry it on our shoulder. And the last one, the tougher one for me is the meditation part and the

339
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.480
method of meditation part, if you're going to the next slide,

340
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:46.640
Yes, next slide. Perfect. So meditate and why meditate and meditate on what meditate on good things.

341
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:55.070
That's what we have in Philippians, meditating on good thing, what is pure, what is novel, what is

342
00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:02.800
positive and Why it is so important because we need to be careful about what we think because your

343
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:13.640
thought runs your life as proverb for 23 is mentioning us. that one is the toughest one for me. Uh

344
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:21.990
and I'll explain to you why? Because when I'm in a tough situation, I'm anything other than call

345
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:30.830
okay, my brain is running scenarios like crazy. I'm looking at all options. I'm trying. I'm also

346
00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.940
putting myself in question about, I've done the maximum I've done the good things that I said, the

347
00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:42.760
good things could have, could have done something more and and it's really a race in my head

348
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:50.860
about the situation, like if I was alone, like explained previously, and so to meditate and

349
00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:58.760
concentrate on good thing and and be able to stop my mind and meditate on good things and have a

350
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:06.010
time of prayer with God, with my mind's not racing on hundreds, other topics is extremely hard for

351
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:13.140
me, so, and I don't know if it's the same thing for you and that's maybe yes, some of you. Yeah, a

352
01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:20.100
bit sometimes. So one of the things that is extremely important with that, uh there is some

353
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:25.250
additional tools that I wanted to share with you this morning and it's based on a book that I've

354
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:31.470
read a year ago and you can see the slide right here um at the next slide you'll see the book is

355
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:39.590
calling chat, the name is chatter and it's the voice in our head why it matters and how to harness

356
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:47.380
it. So that's the challenge sometimes we have when we want to meditate, think about good thing, when

357
01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:56.730
your hamster is racing like crazy, super tough to do. Um so in that book there's different trick

358
01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:05.190
and tools and tips that are given that by the way that that guy is is a doctor. So teaching our how

359
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:14.260
to be able to harness or taught and be able to manage or conscious mind. So it's not someone that is

360
01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:21.190
improvising himself that domain. So, a really interesting book by the way. Um so one of the elements

361
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:27.530
and I've just mentioned a few of them because of the correlation that they have with scripture,

362
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:35.070
truth that we have as well. So there's a lot of other truth in that in that book, but I've

363
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:42.790
underlined those that were a little bit more uh where there was echo in the Bible just for sake of

364
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:51.200
being able to do the parallel. So the use the use of distant self talk and that one. So, so you're

365
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:59.570
in the situation is super tough. And you're really just doing scenarios and thinking only about that.

366
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:07.040
You're really having a hard time to celebrate. Ask Leave and meditate. And and so using self

367
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.870
distinct, self distant talk is really about saying just your name in your head, by the way, saying

368
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:19.130
you want, what are you doing right now, create that perspective. And now you can say to myself, what

369
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:28.840
what what's the link with what we're seeing the the scripture for instance, in some 42 verse five,

370
01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:36.370
the soundness is saying, why are you sad? Oh my soul? Why have you become trouble within me? Hope in

371
01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:45.450
God for I will praise him again for his help of being near me. And you can see a different passage

372
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:53.320
in the Bible that I could find a lot of others where the author of the scripture are talking to the

373
01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:59.040
themselves. So you're not no longer necessarily in your situation, but you're talking to the you of

374
01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:05.570
why are you reacting the way you're reacting what is happening. So this is super interesting tool

375
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:11.990
that you can use. The broaden your perspective is something also extremely important. And the many

376
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:18.880
passages in the scriptures are referring to, don't only consider what you're living but trust in God

377
01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:26.720
that with that situation he is doing that for your good. Like we found in Romans chapter eight verse

378
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:32.850
eight right, expressively. That's another one if you never try to do that. So in the midst of the

379
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:40.030
storm writing your emotion, what you're feeling because rational has no control sometimes. So you

380
01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:47.680
can't harness that in any way. And again, if you look at the scripture, a lot of other have poured

381
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.770
their heart of are they felt in different situation and that's exactly a tool that we can use also

382
01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:02.590
to meditate uh and be able to pray and be concentrated meditation and prayer. We can talk about some

383
01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:09.620
nuance. But let's say that praying and being concentrated on what we're trying to achieve in our

384
01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:15.500
relationship with God that the fourth one was perform a ritual and that one is super interesting

385
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:22.600
because that's not a book based on the Bible, it's really from, from practical science and study.

386
01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:30.520
But I really like the performer ritual because it's super interesting in in, in our current world,

387
01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:40.290
there's a lot of practices that are taken from spiritual practices and from the Bible that are

388
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:49.210
stripped from the Jesus and the god component. So we're taking good habits within the scriptures and

389
01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:55.640
the context of spiritual and we stripped the god component like performing a ritual, having a prayer

390
01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:01.910
time each morning for instance or somewhere and is really helpful to manage and coping with

391
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:09.760
difficulties and finally the increase your exposure to green spaces and seek out uh inspiring,

392
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:19.490
inspiring experience are also wonderful ways to be able to induce that state of prayer and

393
01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:27.690
concentration that we need. So, and again, it's not has all if when we're looking at the scripture,

394
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:34.980
uh enrollments also for for instance saying that when you're looking the nature, the God's

395
01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:42.910
perfection are visible to the naked eyes. If you, you're like, if we're attracted to that creation

396
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:48.680
and that is a reflection to God right here, It's not talking about that, which is pretty good

397
01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:55.040
because obviously, and that's something I really, if you're not sure about how God can help you and

398
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.870
if you're not sure where you stand with your relationship with Jesus, you will have great results

399
01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:05.860
with everything. We we talked so far, so don't be worried about that. The only thing is that with

400
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:13.480
that relationship with Jesus, you can extend the profit and the value that we will have from these

401
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:21.100
practices, it will bring the level, it will bring a level of life that is not possible without that,

402
01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:30.910
but again, applying this without the relationship with Jesus will still give you fantastic result,

403
01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.900
but I really invite you, if you haven't done that step of faith this morning to consider embracing

404
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:45.750
that option. So while the musicians are coming for our last song, I just wanted to uh leave you on

405
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:57.220
one final thought. One of the things that I, I'm always, I'm aiming in my life is to have the Jesus

406
01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:09.360
behavior when things was out of control and Jesus behavior was sleeping okay, So when things were

407
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:17.220
out of control, totally out of control, desperate Jesus was sleeping when things are out of control

408
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:30.200
in my life, my sleep is disturbed, I'm far from being super uh super deeply sleeping when Jesus was

409
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:36.960
when in his shell up in his boat with his disciples and that was the complete, it was a complete

410
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:46.820
craziness all around all around them. What was Jesus doing? Sleeping, sleeping in the chaloupe. Look,

411
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:57.160
while every everybody was panicking, he was sleeping. So one of the things that I imagined myself

412
01:07:57.170 --> 01:08:05.160
when I'm I'm living this difficult moment in my life, my purpose is to be able to sleep like Jesus

413
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:11.910
and I imagine myself in the chaloupe sleeping near him, okay, because I don't know what he was doing

414
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:17.430
to be sleeping first, it was super tired, but seriously, it was zero preoccupied about what was

415
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:23.790
happening because it was clearly knowing that God was in control, that nothing will happen to him at

416
01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:31.000
this moment. And he was completely certain of those things. So that was his assurance that he

417
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:39.490
carried with him all his ministry long. So that was a strong foundation, Jesus himself was really

418
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:46.400
anchored also in that meditation, that prayer moment. How many times we're seeing in the scripture

419
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:53.130
that Jesus, even if it was frantic around him, he was taking time alone in the desert to maintain

420
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:59.630
that relationship with God, to be able to celebrate him, to be able to ask him what he needs to be

421
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:05.560
able to leave him his concern and renew his strength in him and be able to have that confrontation that he

422
01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:11.880
needed. And he was going in the mountain in the desert in nature and and all of this also that that

423
01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:17.580
is an echo to what we've seen and what we've measured also scientifically, that has good impact, but

424
01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:24.800
spiritually it's even greater impact. So this morning as a thanksgiving in a thanksgiving Sunday,

425
01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:32.200
maybe this message is part of this message was for you and maybe part of this message wasn't

426
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.570
necessarily for you and maybe you're not in a difficult season, but maybe you can think about

427
01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:44.390
someone who is in a difficult season this morning and you no longer you can no longer yes, you can

428
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:54.600
be these, this message this morning could be helpful for your own life, but we're also called to be

429
01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:03.790
and now for people that are around us and we we need to consider how can we be an occasion to be a

430
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:12.710
thanksgiving subject from the other. So not only we can be thankful that God is with us in our

431
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:19.220
difficulties and it gives us tools to be able to remain calm in that situation. But we can consider
