00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:06.329
Or soccer. Being thankful is like a muscle. You have to work out to get stronger. Exactly. Choosing

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.710
to be thankful every day can retrain our brain. If you practice thankfulness over time, it will

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.530
actually make you more joyful even in tough times. But it helps to start small. Like if the bus is

4
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.850
late and you have to wait, you don't have to complain. Yeah, you can look around at the beautiful

5
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.549
fall leaves and thank God for them. Or if your mom makes you clean your room, you can be thankful.

6
00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:36.750
You have a room to clean up. I think you've got it. See you next time. Bye. So here's the thing.

7
00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:44.380
It doesn't have to be a chore. You can always find more. Give one. Shout out or four. You don't have

8
00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:51.209
to keep score enough. Where's the door? Thanks for joining us in the story lab. See you next time.

9
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.509
What cost you a dime?

10
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.269
I am seeking,

11
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:55.250
searching for the things this world has rejected, the things that are broken that are flawed, thrown

12
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.170
away and discarded.

13
00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:08.149
I seek the lost, the damaged, the forgotten things, the overlooked and the neglected,

14
00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:14.559
the things that have been pushed aside and left behind.

15
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:24.190
Why, why do I do this?

16
00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:30.869
Why? Chase after that, which is despised by so many.

17
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:44.708
It is because I have chosen the rejected. I bring restoration to the broken. I see beyond the flaws

18
00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:52.030
and the imperfections and I bring new life to the lost. This world has called them useless and

19
00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:56.070
garbage, hopeless and unwanted.

20
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:08.429
They have been scarred, abused, ignored and unloved, but I, I have reclaimed them and they belong to

21
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:17.559
me now. They are my masterpiece and I have a plan and a future for every single one

22
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:28.659
for. I am crafting these dissonant and discarded pieces into something beautiful.

23
00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:51.989
Good morning. River's Edge. Welcome back. Thank you for being here. We're so happy to share our

24
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.900
Sunday with you and with everyone online this morning, just a reminder that youth ministry, high

25
00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:05.940
schoolers um start at 10 a.m. every Sunday and that our children's ministry starts at 1030 our

26
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:12.090
service starts at 1030. And so we just wanna welcome you all here. We have a very special Sunday

27
00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:19.190
today. Uh We're starting a new C series called Rejected, which I think we can all relate to in one

28
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.030
way or another. But before that, we have the privilege of witnessing four baptisms. So we have four

29
00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:30.719
of our own today. Yes, clap for them.

30
00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:40.780
It's powerful. So four of our own will be standing in front of us today bravely giving their

31
00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:47.190
testimony, telling us how God has worked in their lives, has changed their lives and they are

32
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.859
committing in public to walk and journey with Jesus going forward. So we're gonna support them today.

33
00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:01.320
And before that, we're gonna stand together because we are in the presence of God and He loves you

34
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.000
and He has a word for each and every one of you this morning. He wants you to be encouraged and walk

35
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:14.239
in a life of faith and love and hope. So. Let's stand. Let's prepare our hearts and the worship team

36
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.299
is gonna take it away.

37
00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:25.880
We're gonna sing the song called so good because our Lord and Savior is so good. Let's do this.

38
00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:49.830
I've got a notion of comfort that surround.

39
00:11:51.900 --> 00:12:00.650
I've got a hope that gives me joy in suffering and I've got to never Benny time.

40
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.710
Oh What you love it. You love it. You love chasing after me. You are.

41
00:12:10.849 --> 00:12:12.020
I got you.

42
00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:42.080
I've opened a mind.

Oh ho

116
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:00.239
oh

117
00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:03.510
Welcome to River's Edge. And I'm so glad that you could be a part of this gathering today. Uh We're

118
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.550
gonna be celebrating some baptisms right now. And um uh during, during the week, there were two

119
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:16.729
other people who uh couldn't get baptized today, but we, we had the opportunity to baptize them. And

120
00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:24.510
um and I just wanted to just highlight um how special it was uh to be able to uh baptize Yolanda and

121
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:31.229
Craig uh this past week as well. So Yolanda would you stand? Is Craig with you? No, but you can

122
00:27:31.239 --> 00:27:31.729
stand.

123
00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:42.800
And so it was just a beautiful celebration to do uh during the week. So as you can understand, we

124
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.500
don't always do them on Sunday. Sometimes there's other uh opportunities for them to, for us to do

125
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:52.619
them. And so uh Yolanda and Craig got baptized this past week. But today we have four people that I

126
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:58.880
want to introduce to you that are gonna be um getting baptized. And um and the four people are um

127
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:04.079
right here behind me. Would you guys come and I'm missing one, but maybe she backed out already. I'm

128
00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:08.209
not sure. But, but we have um Patricia

129
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:17.390
and then we have Marc Andre and we have uh Tim and then of course, we also have Prell which she'll be

130
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.770
out in just a few moments.

131
00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:28.459
And so, um because I don't want them to miss out on what's happening. You guys can bring your chairs

132
00:28:28.469 --> 00:28:33.339
over here. Um And then that way you guys can witness what's going on over there. And then Patricia

133
00:28:33.349 --> 00:28:38.780
you're gonna go first and just share your story and the reason why you've made this decision today.

134
00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:44.790
And um and just, you know, we're gonna then take the next steps with you. So, would you welcome

135
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.819
Patricia, please?

136
00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:57.800
Ok. Is this good? Can people hear me? Ok. Hi. I feel like I have to be like this. Can we, could I

137
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:58.489
just grab it for?

138
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:10.859
It's good. It's ok. Ok, thanks. Ok. So I guess you might be wondering why I'm not already baptized.

139
00:29:11.229 --> 00:29:18.239
Um I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior five years ago and I think as many of, you know, it's been

140
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:24.479
a very solitary journey, not alone. I was with Jesus the whole time, but it's been a solitary one

141
00:29:24.869 --> 00:29:32.739
traveling the world and I think there's been a couple of reasons for that. Um I think because God

142
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:38.949
wanted, because I was very gullible and very susceptible and easily convinced of things. God wanted

143
00:29:38.959 --> 00:29:44.949
me to be isolated to get to know who He is without uh the confusion of other people's versions of

144
00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:51.619
who he is. And also because of past trauma, I didn't trust anyone other than Children. So I think

145
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:58.880
that's why I wasn't part of a church and I didn't have a community like this um to get baptized. And

146
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:04.390
I also like to think that I baptized myself. I don't know if that's biblical, but I thought it was

147
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:11.180
that I did it. But then when Lorenzo mentioned it, I was like, OK, let's do it again. Um And I had

148
00:30:11.189 --> 00:30:17.130
the option to do it last week with Yolanda in private. But I think I know God wanted me to do it

149
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:23.119
today with you guys to show my gratitude to River's Edge because as I said, this is all new for me

150
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:30.839
to have a community and brothers and sisters that I can trust. So I wanted to of course, show that I

151
00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:36.890
put my trust and hope in Jesus, but also my gratitude towards you guys.

152
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.239
Um

153
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:48.609
So I don't, I won't go into my whole testimony because it's a bit kind of like a weird dream. Um You

154
00:30:48.619 --> 00:30:52.599
know, when you try to explain to someone, you your weird dream, Lorenzo did this to us once. He's

155
00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:57.119
like, oh there was a dog, he was smoking a cigarette and you were there but it wasn't really you.

156
00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:05.530
That's like my testimony. So I won't torture you guys like that today. But I'll sorry. So I'll just

157
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:13.209
talk about one small part of it. Um So I was raised atheist in an atheist home. God was never

158
00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:18.680
mentioned and if he was mentioned, it was in a demeaning way. Spirituality was a no, no, even psycho

159
00:31:18.869 --> 00:31:25.640
psychology was a no, no in our house. Um And I was 12 when I started to suffer from depression and

160
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:33.439
anxiety and uh suicidal thoughts and the devil had me believing that I was worth absolutely nothing

161
00:31:33.449 --> 00:31:41.280
and that the world would be better off if I were dead. And I believed him for 23 years. And in those

162
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:49.069
23 years, I ended up often at the hospital or at the psych ward for suicide attempts. And

163
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:54.910
um and yeah, life was really hard because when you believe that you are worth nothing, you make

164
00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.459
choices in your life that will confirm that you are worth nothing. So just life got harder and

165
00:32:00.469 --> 00:32:06.819
harder in those 23 years. But God was always there and I could see that now that He was always there

166
00:32:06.829 --> 00:32:14.459
right next to me. And somehow by God's grace, he gave me a way out and he gave me the strength to

167
00:32:14.469 --> 00:32:22.469
take it. And as you know, he sent me all over the world and I met Children. And as I like to say,

168
00:32:22.479 --> 00:32:28.180
it's through the kids that God revealed himself to me. And first I had to learn that God is real. So

169
00:32:28.189 --> 00:32:35.060
when I, I accepted that, uh I still didn't know about Jesus. I remember uh when you travel a lot,

170
00:32:35.069 --> 00:32:38.119
sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and you have, I don't know if this has happened to

171
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.390
you, but you have no idea where you are. Like you wake up and you're like, I don't know which

172
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:46.500
country I'm in. I don't know if I'm in a hotel in a house and it, and I had a dream or a vision. I

173
00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:51.160
don't know, you could call it whatever you want. But I, I was the devil and he kept saying she's

174
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:59.760
mine, she's mine. She's mine until God came in and he said, well, she's mine now. And I saw how much

175
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:06.119
God was fighting for me as he's fighting for every single one of us and I was still very stubborn.

176
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.949
It took me a few months before I accepted Jesus. God kept dropping hints about Jesus. And I, I was

177
00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:18.839
like, no, that's not what I need. Um Until I started to hear about what he did for us on the cross

178
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:24.839
and that forgiveness was possible and redemption was possible. And I thought that was the most

179
00:33:24.849 --> 00:33:31.760
beautiful thing I've ever heard. So I did accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior, but I was alone. And

180
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:38.459
this time I didn't know any Christians. So I didn't know how to pray and I didn't have anyone to ask.

181
00:33:38.469 --> 00:33:45.660
So I just prayed the same prayer I would ask God, please just do whatever it takes for me to become

182
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:50.939
what you need me to be, to fight for your glory. Because I remembered how much He was fighting for

183
00:33:50.949 --> 00:33:58.229
me and God always answers prayers. So uh it was really hard. I'm not gonna pretend the first few

184
00:33:58.239 --> 00:34:04.560
years that God was easy. He took a lot away and he took a lot away to the point where I started to

185
00:34:04.569 --> 00:34:13.510
question not him, but his goodness because I did not feel his protection the way he had promised me.

186
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:22.638
Um So I kept asking God, where are you? And his reply to me was from the Book of Numbers. He kept

187
00:34:22.648 --> 00:34:28.229
telling me I won't be with you because you refuse to follow me. And when he said that to me, I was

188
00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:33.239
so mad at him because I, I couldn't understand how can he say that I've given you everything, you've

189
00:34:33.249 --> 00:34:39.770
taken everything. But he kept telling me I won't be with you because you refused to follow me. And

190
00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:47.389
so I prayed that same prayer. I said, ok, God, you must be right and I'm wrong. So I asked him just

191
00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:55.669
do whatever it takes for me to completely follow you with my whole heart. And God took a lot away

192
00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:02.040
again. I didn't know there was still more to take, but he took it all until he really, I fell to my

193
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:08.929
knees and life was not good. Uh It was really hard and I made a list of all the things that were

194
00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:16.040
happening to me. And I said, ok, God, let's say it's like this till the end till my very last day that

195
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:23.889
I'm gonna be sick um alone and broke and bankrupt. And that year he had taken the foundation away.

196
00:35:23.899 --> 00:35:30.169
So let's like, let's say I never see those kids again or I never help any kid again. Let's say, um

197
00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:34.320
I'm just going from job to job and I don't get married and I never have kids and I don't have a

198
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:41.489
house and going from couch to house to home and I never see anyone come to Christ, not anyone that I

199
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:47.330
love. Not no one at all. Let's say it's gonna be like this until the very my very last breath. I

200
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:53.669
told God that, that I would still follow him and I know that he knows that I meant that with all my

201
00:35:53.679 --> 00:36:02.219
heart and I know it too and things changed that day I could from then on, feel his protection and

202
00:36:02.229 --> 00:36:10.860
his constant presence in my life. And, um, so five years ago I accepted Jesus and then I came home

203
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.790
about a year later and I was really excited to come home because I was like, oh, I can join the

204
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:21.149
church. It's gonna be amazing. Uh And then it wasn't this church, but I tried to go to a church and

205
00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:27.719
I remember I was so scared that I just hung out at the door, kind of like in between the two front

206
00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:32.679
doors, kinda like how we have here because I didn't think that I deserved to come and sit down with

207
00:36:32.689 --> 00:36:38.050
everyone else. And then until God told me like, you can go inside now, you can sit down with

208
00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:45.179
everyone else. Um And last year when I was in Madagascar, you all know my little boy, Teftasu, the

209
00:36:45.189 --> 00:36:50.739
boy with leprosy. I always talk about him. Uh He's a street kid and so he's always begging on the

210
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:58.179
street and God led me to him and when we finally got the medication for his leprosy, um it was just

211
00:36:58.189 --> 00:37:02.280
me and him. So I told him like, oh, before I go to work, meet me every morning in front of this

212
00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:07.679
building at seven o'clock and I will give you your medication. And he, he was really good. We

213
00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:13.399
started, I think on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, um, and he showed up seven o'clock Thursday, he showed

214
00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:18.800
up Friday, Saturday, he showed up, but then on Sunday he didn't show up and I was really worried. I

215
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:23.590
thought maybe he doesn't trust me anymore. So I didn't know what to do. And the people around us

216
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:30.149
around me, he told me he's probably begging in front of a church. It's Sunday. This is the day that

217
00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:37.040
he'll make the most money. So I looked all over town. I went from church to church running around

218
00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:43.340
for about three hours and I couldn't find him. And then God told me just go eat an ice cream and p

219
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.580
understands she knows which ice cream I'm talking about. And I was like, God, I can't eat an ice

220
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.699
cream. I have to find him. This is not time to eat an ice cream. He's like, just go eat an ice cream.

221
00:37:52.159 --> 00:37:56.669
And so it was like 11 am Sunday. I'm eating an ice cream on the side of the road and then guess who

222
00:37:56.679 --> 00:38:02.870
walks by? He walks by the little boy Teftasu with leprosy and I'm like, Teffy. Where have you been? And he

223
00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:07.379
tells me he's been begging all morning in front of church, raising money. So I didn't say anything

224
00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:12.939
for a couple of days. I just waited and then I sat him down for chicken sandwiches. He loves chicken

225
00:38:12.949 --> 00:38:18.889
sandwiches. And I told him, well, I asked him, I said, Teffy, do you know how much Jesus loves you?

226
00:38:19.979 --> 00:38:28.280
And I told him Jesus loves you so much that he wants you to heal completely from your leprosy and

227
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:33.540
your tuberculosis. And he loves you so much. He wants you to go to school and learn how to read and

228
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:41.020
write and play music and have friends and play sports. And he loves you so much that um he doesn't

229
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.919
want you to beg on the streets anymore and he doesn't want you to beg outside of church on Sunday

230
00:38:45.929 --> 00:38:52.169
anymore. And I told him the same thing that God told me when I was hanging out in between the doors.

231
00:38:52.409 --> 00:38:59.870
He says, like you can go inside and sit down with everyone else. And that is so good. That week we

232
00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:04.850
used to walk by a building every day to go to work. And that week a missionary couple planted an

233
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:12.510
evangelical church. And so we brought him Paul and I on Sunday to church and we all sat down

234
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.639
together and I think it was just the week after that Prell accepted Jesus as her Lord and savior in

235
00:39:17.649 --> 00:39:25.919
that church as well. Um OK, the reason why I'm sharing this is because in those 23 years, when I was

236
00:39:25.929 --> 00:39:32.189
really depressed and living in complete darkness, I did not believe in God but I would call out to

237
00:39:32.199 --> 00:39:40.580
him and I would beg him to help me. And, um, sorry, I want to take a sip of water

238
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:49.959
and I know God is good and I'm sure he heard my prayers. And so I don't know, I wonder, maybe I

239
00:39:49.969 --> 00:39:56.030
shouldn't wonder this, but I do wonder if he sent someone to find me in those 23 years the way he

240
00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:04.899
had sent me to find Teftasu in Madagascar. But nobody came and nobody came to tell me that God

241
00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:15.409
loved me so much that he sacrificed his one and only son. And, and uh I guess all I know today is

242
00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:20.889
that I don't want to be that person. I don't want to be the kind of person that doesn't answer God's

243
00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:28.179
call. I want to be obedient and I keep praying that prayer every day that God just do whatever it

244
00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:38.090
takes for me to be a good and faithful servant to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I'm ready.

245
00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:04.120
And so Patricia based on your confession of faith, I baptize you in the name of the father and of

246
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:07.030
the Son and the Holy Spirit, one God, amen.

247
00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:25.449
And so Lord, we wanna pray over Patricia's life. We thank you for what you have done uh to bring her

248
00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:29.949
to this point. We thank you that you've journeyed with her every step of the way. And she shared

249
00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:35.120
just a little bit about her story and in just a few short days, she'll be going to Madagascar again

250
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:43.550
uh to continue with the work um that she has started there with others and um in Tanzania as well,

251
00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:50.919
and we just pray your, your blessing on her, her team, her life, her decision today and how this act

252
00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:56.959
of obedience is gonna lead to greater obedience and how it's going to lead to greater blessings. How

253
00:41:56.969 --> 00:42:06.949
today she's been able to leave all things behind and able right now to be raised in the new life

254
00:42:06.959 --> 00:42:12.520
that she now has in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.

255
00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:40.850
Perfect. So this is uh Marc Andre. Would you welcome him?

256
00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:53.270
Thank you. Good morning everyone. My name is Marc Andre. I'm 49 years old. So that's why I'm gonna read

257
00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.949
today. The reason why the, the reason why I mentioned my age is because I want you to have

258
00:43:01.959 --> 00:43:07.770
a better understanding of the events that lead me to become a follower of Jesus Christ. But first, I

259
00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.800
would like to thank the River Edge community, especially Pastor Lorenzo and all the volunteers. I

260
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:19.929
also would like to thank my sister and her family who are here today and my friend and we are here

261
00:43:19.939 --> 00:43:26.189
today to witness a special event in my life and also my partner, my future wife Bril, who she is

262
00:43:26.199 --> 00:43:29.020
here. She's the one who brought me to this church.

263
00:43:31.489 --> 00:43:37.189
I have to admit that the moment I stepped into this church, I felt a warm and inviting atmosphere

264
00:43:37.199 --> 00:43:43.709
make me realize that I truly belong here. And I'm extremely happy and thankful to be part of this

265
00:43:43.719 --> 00:43:52.050
wonderful community. So three years ago, I was not a believer. I did not really know Jesus. I did

266
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:58.520
not know anything about him dying on the cross to save our sins. I grew up in a traditional Catholic

267
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:05.489
non practicing family. I was baptized as an infant. I did my first communion. But without

268
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:12.149
understanding it and of course, without believing in it. Oh, sorry.

269
00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:22.949
Uh I believe it. And after the old event, I didn't think about God at all as a teenager, I was

270
00:44:22.959 --> 00:44:28.929
listening to death metal music, old school rap. I did a lot of bad things. I got into fight. I stole,

271
00:44:28.939 --> 00:44:39.449
I used drug and alcohol. I was, hey, so keep moving. Sorry. I was addicted to pornography and I had

272
00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:47.000
sex before marriage. I was even occasionally a bully and I'm not proud of that. When I turned to

273
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:54.929
2626 years old, my life changed. I had a kid and I got married. So I was more wise and responsible

274
00:44:54.939 --> 00:45:03.030
but still without God in my life before I turn 30 I start searching for something, I did not know

275
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:10.439
exactly what it is at, at that, uh what it is that I was searching. But somehow I want to know the

276
00:45:10.449 --> 00:45:17.870
truth and I didn't, at that time I didn't even know what kind of truth I was looking for. So 15

277
00:45:17.879 --> 00:45:26.159
years I was watching documentary about pyramid, ancient civilization, aliens, secret society of the

278
00:45:26.169 --> 00:45:32.929
world and all that, I was glued to these things. And the more I watched, the more I was fascinated

279
00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:40.639
to search for more. And I did not really find anything that satisfy me. In fact, I still felt empty

280
00:45:40.649 --> 00:45:41.820
after devoting. So,

281
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:45.929
hello, sorry again.

282
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:58.290
OK. Until one day in 2021 during the the pandemic, I came across a youtube video of Dr Pierre Gilbert, a

283
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:05.939
French Canadian speaker. He was talking about secret society and while he was talking about it, he

284
00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:12.580
will often refer something from the Bible. And he said one word that changed everything. The word is

285
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:20.600
peche which is sin in English. So I automatically question myself about the word sin. I wasn't sure

286
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:28.790
what it means. I was so curious. So I text my sister Bridgette the only believer in our family who

287
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.669
later on she revealed to me that she was praying for me for 20 years praying that I will find the

288
00:46:34.679 --> 00:46:42.669
truth. So my sister gave me detail about sins was how sins was explained in the Bible. I got even

289
00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:49.239
more curious. So I asked her if she could give me a Bible. And uh I went to my sister place to pick

290
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:56.550
up the Bible. And she gave me advice to start reading it in the book of Matthew, to pray to notre pere,

291
00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:04.739
our father. She also advised me to, to watch the TV series. The chosen. So every morning I was

292
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:14.179
reading the Bible, pray our father. And at the evening, I will watch the chosen one week after I

293
00:47:14.189 --> 00:47:22.389
found myself repenting to the Lord. He revealed to me what sin is. I fell on my knee. I was crying

294
00:47:22.399 --> 00:47:29.510
to Jesus, forgive me. I did not believe in you. I thought you were not real. Please forgive me for

295
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:37.469
my sins. I accept you as my Lord and Savior. I know you die for us on the cross. After that pray

296
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:45.810
that prayer, I experienced peace, something that I never felt before. And the Holy Spirit filled me

297
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:57.010
with the true who God is. Many days later, I told Prell, my partner and my future wife, what happened

298
00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:03.250
to me? And we were both surprised that day. She was surprised that uh that God was working in my

299
00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:09.320
life. And I was surprised to know that she is a believer. She never talked to me about her personal

300
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:15.790
relationship with Jesus. Later on, she revealed to me the reason why she never talked about her fate

301
00:48:16.459 --> 00:48:24.229
and she, she is here today to share to you her story. God is so good. I am so thankful for Prell's

302
00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:33.209
life and how good God brought us together. So, since I became a Christian, my life changed a lot. I

303
00:48:33.219 --> 00:48:40.120
could say that I had a, I had a cold heart before. And now since Jesus healed my heart, I just have

304
00:48:40.129 --> 00:48:48.479
this love in me that is overflowing. You know, God love is flowing through me that I just feel like

305
00:48:48.489 --> 00:48:54.060
hugging everybody and tell them Jesus love them. I used to be a guy who was fascinated to the

306
00:48:54.070 --> 00:49:01.689
worldly thing, but now no more. I was also able to forgive to all the people in my life that hurt me.

307
00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:09.010
And this is because of God, Jesus touched my heart and I realized we need to forgive those people

308
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:17.709
who hurt us. And for me forgiving them is about freedom to be free from the chain from the past. I

309
00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:23.820
also not noticed that the music I was listening before doesn't interest me anymore. In fact, worldly

310
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:31.439
thing just doesn't fancy me anymore. And instead of being mad about what is going on in the world,

311
00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:39.620
even if it's sad, really sad. Now I have an understanding and I know that God is still in control.

312
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.889
My thoughts now are all about Jesus every morning when I wake up and think about him and all

313
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:51.949
throughout the day to continue to grow in my faith. I pray. I read the Bible. I also connect with

314
00:49:51.959 --> 00:49:58.360
other believer. I love music. So I worship our creator almost every day. God speak to me mostly

315
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:06.439
through this Christian music that I listen to. I'm still amazed how Jesus came and met me that day

316
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:12.489
when I pray and I receive him as my Lord and Savior. I did not know that Jesus was the truth that I

317
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:19.139
was searching for. I did not know that he is the way the truth and the life Jesus gave me a purpose.

318
00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:27.699
He also healed a lot of area in my life. He helped me remove the fear and anxiety and he replaced it

319
00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:35.979
with peace and joy and I know who hold my future. So I'm really determined to live my Christian life

320
00:50:35.989 --> 00:50:41.679
as a follower of Jesus Christ. That's why I decided to get baptized and declare that He is my savior

321
00:50:41.689 --> 00:50:47.050
and my God. So this is my story. Thank you for all being there with, with this special event in my

322
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.870
life. Thank you,

323
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:13.050
praise God. And so based on your confession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of the father

324
00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.129
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. One God. Amen.

325
00:51:28.879 --> 00:51:34.870
and so we thank you for the way that you've put your hand of blessing upon Marc Andre for the way that

326
00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:40.590
you have led him to you and for how you continue to lead him every step of the way for the great

327
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:46.939
things that you've already done in his life and for the greater things that are before him and for

328
00:51:46.949 --> 00:51:53.479
the steps that he is still to take and for the discoveries he is still to make and for the depth in

329
00:51:53.489 --> 00:52:00.969
which his relationship with you, God is still to be experienced. We know that you have so much more

330
00:52:00.979 --> 00:52:07.040
in store for Him and you're going to continue to use him and bless him. We pray that you bless his

331
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:14.129
life and we thank you for how he has left the past behind and for how he has been raised in the new

332
00:52:14.139 --> 00:52:21.600
life that he has received from Jesus Christ, his Lord and Savior in Jesus name. We pray. Amen. Amen.

333
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:30.840
Would you welcome Prell?

334
00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:47.870
Hello, everyone. So I'm Prell and uh you've heard you just heard the story of how Marc

335
00:52:47.879 --> 00:52:54.239
encountered the Lord. And now I would like to share mine. But before anything else, I would like to

336
00:52:54.250 --> 00:53:02.739
thank uh Pastor Lorenzo for giving me and mark that baptism course that we needed uh making sure

337
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:09.520
that we understand uh the decision that we made, especially that in my case, uh I wanted to get

338
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:19.010
rebaptized. Um I will, I also would like to thank my friends and family who are here today. Uh These

339
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:26.810
are the people um who have witnessed my faith journey. And so I'm thankful that they are here. Ok.

340
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:35.889
So I would like to begin my story um by sharing how God brought me back to him during the same time

341
00:53:35.899 --> 00:53:44.979
that Mark began his walk in the Lord. The twist is that Mark had no idea about my faith. Because at

342
00:53:44.989 --> 00:53:55.030
the time when we met, I was hiding from God, I was in a spiritually dry place, struggling with

343
00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:02.149
disappointment and confusion in my faith journey. So Mark never knew that I have a personal

344
00:54:02.159 --> 00:54:09.709
relationship with Jesus. You see, I had a strong Christian foundation. When I was growing up there

345
00:54:09.719 --> 00:54:16.530
in the Philippines, I was raised by Christian parents, attended a Christian school. I was surrounded

346
00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:24.840
by Christian friends and our family actively participated in various church ministries, but I was

347
00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:32.080
baptized at a young age and I did not fully grasp the significance of it. But back then, I remember

348
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:39.719
that uh my life revolved around Jesus. I remember praying and sing songs to him every day and every

349
00:54:39.729 --> 00:54:47.120
night in my room. And you know, life looks so wonderful and easy. Uh when you are young and in love

350
00:54:47.129 --> 00:54:54.669
with Jesus. However, as an adult, uh life's challenges tested me in ways I could not have

351
00:54:54.679 --> 00:55:03.570
anticipated. In 2007, I moved here to Canada a year later I got married, but the marriage didn't

352
00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:12.399
last. It ended after just two years, leaving me heartbroken to the core. I experienced a kind of

353
00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:20.969
pain that led me to contemplate ending it all and something I had never imagined. But in the, in the

354
00:55:20.979 --> 00:55:28.889
midst of that Brokenness, I encountered Jesus on a whole new level. It's true what they say about

355
00:55:28.899 --> 00:55:36.290
finding blessings in Brokenness because during my divorce, I truly understood what it meant to have

356
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:43.810
a personal relationship with God. I realized that my upbringing had sheltered me from the

357
00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:51.469
disruptions that can occur in a Christian life. I was only 27 when I got divorced and it it was a

358
00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:59.530
wake up call to the fact that life is hard and Christians are not immune to its hardships. Despite

359
00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:06.800
the devastation, my relationship with God deepened and I felt that God was drawing me closer to him.

360
00:56:07.209 --> 00:56:14.800
And, and as a and as an adult facing a personal crisis, I got to know Him better than when I was a

361
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:22.550
child. So I learned that God can heal a broken heart, provide a peace that surpasses all

362
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:30.969
understanding and offer hope in the face of uncertainty. So when my world was shaken and I felt lost

363
00:56:30.979 --> 00:56:40.500
and alone, I cried out to God and he rescued me. I felt him grieving with me, I felt him grieving

364
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:47.770
with me over the loss of my marriage. And as I followed and yielded to him, he began the process of

365
00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:56.590
restoring me. I believe that His desire for everyone is to make us whole because we are all broken

366
00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:06.639
in some way. However, achieving wholeness is not an immediate process. Um It requires trust to the

367
00:57:06.649 --> 00:57:14.330
one who knows us best. So I met Jesus in the secret places of my heart and I, and I allowed him to

368
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:21.899
heal the parts I had been avoiding because nobody, nobody enjoys confronting their pain, right? And

369
00:57:21.909 --> 00:57:28.510
because it hurts and but his strength and guidance with his strength and guidance, I face it

370
00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:35.489
together with him. And as we address my Brokenness, Jesus revealed areas in my life that needed

371
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:44.719
change. I discovered that I was selfish, hot, tempered, materialistic, envious of others and and

372
00:57:44.959 --> 00:57:51.699
struggling with pride. And I really thought that pride is only for those people who think highly of

373
00:57:51.709 --> 00:58:01.780
themselves. But Jesus exposed a type of pride in me that only he could reveal. So he even helped me

374
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:10.830
break free from watching pornography, demonstrating his power to liberate us from our chains. So

375
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:18.629
only Jesus can do that. Only he can break the chains of whatever it is that's restraining you. I

376
00:58:18.639 --> 00:58:26.540
have to say that Jesus is the kindest person. I know when he exposes a sin in your life or anything

377
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:33.719
that's holding you down, he will never condemn you. Instead he will show you his kindness. And I

378
00:58:33.729 --> 00:58:40.399
cannot really describe it, but he just has this way of telling it to you. And his kindness is

379
00:58:40.409 --> 00:58:48.780
revealed in your heart and all you can do is confess and surrender into his loving arms. So I

380
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:55.510
experienced God's healing over my life, including forgiving my ex-husband. And it's so hard to

381
00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:03.659
forgive someone will hurt you, right? But if you allow Jesus to give you his perspective over a

382
00:59:03.669 --> 00:59:11.229
situation, you will soon realize that he is changing the way you think and the way you feel about

383
00:59:11.239 --> 00:59:18.110
that particular situation. It doesn't happen overnight though Jesus takes you through a process of

384
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:26.020
which he alone knows what it looks like. And while we go through it and submit to his leadership, he

385
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:33.860
will reveal himself, his kindness, his goodness, and his love towards you and how much he truly

386
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:42.179
cares for your life. Now, you might wonder why was I in a spiritually dry place when I met? Mark?

387
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:50.250
The answer lies in the fact that the journey of faith looks different for everyone just as we all

388
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:57.169
have unique paths in our walk with the Lord. And I believe that whatever journey we are on, God

389
00:59:57.179 --> 01:00:03.830
always has a purpose in mind. And we have to learn to trust that his ways are higher than our ways

390
01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:12.719
and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and that he will always turn it out for our good. In

391
01:00:12.729 --> 01:00:20.899
my case, after my divorce, God led me into a wilderness season marked by silence. My divorce healing

392
01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:31.189
took three years and then the wilderness season began. It was dry and barren and I felt abandoned by

393
01:00:31.199 --> 01:00:38.159
God. I, because I had grown accustomed to feeling his presence and hearing from him. And this

394
01:00:38.169 --> 01:00:45.649
silence made me question his presence. But he was teaching me a crucial lesson of which I only

395
01:00:45.659 --> 01:00:54.830
understood now. And that is to trust him, despite my feelings, he showed me that my faith should not

396
01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:02.689
be based on emotions, but on his word. As found in the Bible, I needed to understand the importance

397
01:01:02.699 --> 01:01:11.070
of relying on his promises and the truth of his word no matter the circumstance. But at the time, my

398
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:17.729
my learning curve was slow and I did not understand his silence. I just felt abandoned, but I still

399
01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:25.090
kept striving, trying to understand what he is doing. I was wrestling with God and in the midst of

400
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:31.379
that wrestle, I learned to hear from him in a whole new way. I learned to obey. I learned to trust

401
01:01:31.389 --> 01:01:39.739
that he has a good plan for my life. And so I waited for that good plan but has something happened

402
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:47.090
in the waiting. And I'm sure maybe some of you can relate that we all get tired. I got tired and I

403
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:53.899
felt disappointed in God. I was waiting for his promises to be fulfilled. But it felt like I had to

404
01:01:53.909 --> 01:02:01.399
wait some more 12 years had gone by and I was just so lost. I didn't understand what was happening

405
01:02:01.409 --> 01:02:07.929
in my life. I was seeking him yet I was lost in this journey. And within those 12 years, my

406
01:02:07.939 --> 01:02:15.219
disappointment towards God just got so built up. And so many things happened in those 12 years that

407
01:02:15.229 --> 01:02:21.969
I could not pinpoint where my disappointment, my disappointment was coming from. And I just didn't

408
01:02:21.979 --> 01:02:29.020
feel like talking to God anymore. And so I rebelled and my heart went cold. And so that's the reason

409
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:36.020
why for the first two years of my relationship with Mark, I was numb to God. And in my heart, I had

410
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:45.260
quietly declared that I was done with him, but God wasn't done with me. And his move began when Mark

411
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:51.909
encountered the Lord, which took both of us by surprise because you see Mark and I never talk about

412
01:02:51.919 --> 01:02:59.010
God. In fact, he kind of impressed to me early on in our relationship that he's an atheist and he

413
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:04.860
was be busy believing in those aliens and secret society that he keeps telling me about. And the

414
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:11.879
last thing I would expect is for God to work in his life. But he, but when he told me that he

415
01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:19.969
received Jesus as his personal savior, I was stunned and that's where he was also shocked to know

416
01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:26.350
that I am a Christian that I know God. And so when he knew about it, he just kept asking me one

417
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:32.629
question after another about God and the Bible. And we would have these conversations about it. But

418
01:03:32.639 --> 01:03:39.419
the truth was, I felt so uneasy in those conversations because I didn't wanna tell Mark that I was

419
01:03:39.429 --> 01:03:46.060
distant towards God. And eventually I had to tell him, I had to tell him the truth. And he

420
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:53.790
understood by the work of the Holy Spirit. He understood that my journey is different from His, that

421
01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:01.169
God deals with all of us in a different way. And as weeks went by, I would catch Mark, I would wake

422
01:04:01.179 --> 01:04:07.030
up in the morning, I would catch Mark in our dining table praying to God, praising, praising him

423
01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.459
with songs and reading the Bible. And every time I would witness that I could not help but groan,

424
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:20.689
groan silently because it felt like God was drawing me back to him. And all I wanted to do in that

425
01:04:20.699 --> 01:04:29.120
moment is to fall back into his arms. I wanted to go home, but I just couldn't. I was held back from

426
01:04:29.129 --> 01:04:36.459
all those disappointments I felt towards him until one day I came across a music video on youtube of

427
01:04:36.469 --> 01:04:43.669
Cody Carnes entitled Run To the Father. And that song brought me to tears to my niece because in

428
01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:52.139
that song, it says I've carried a burden for too long on my own. I was not created to bear it alone.

429
01:04:52.449 --> 01:05:00.709
I hear your invitation to let it all go. I see it now and I'm laying it down. I know that I need you.

430
01:05:00.719 --> 01:05:08.149
And so I run to the father. I fall into grace. I'm done with a hiding. No reason to wait. My heart

431
01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:14.659
needs a surgeon, my soul. Needs a friend. And so I run to the father again and again and again. And

432
01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:22.879
I was crying because that song depicted how tired I was of running away from God. And in my hiding,

433
01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:30.679
I realized that I cannot escape Him, that he will keep finding me and he will never stop fighting to

434
01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:37.919
bring me back home. And in that song, God revealed to me that the burden of carried is too much for

435
01:05:37.929 --> 01:05:46.699
me to carry it alone. And finally, I understood what the burden was and the bur and it was the

436
01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:54.320
burden of unanswered questions and unanswered prayers. And that led me to feel disappointment

437
01:05:54.330 --> 01:06:00.959
towards God and I had to release it. I had to release those burdens to Him. I I need to let it all

438
01:06:00.969 --> 01:06:08.429
go. And he said that to let it all go means to surrender and surrendering also meant that I had to

439
01:06:08.439 --> 01:06:17.939
tell him my real feelings. And, and that is, I really feel hurt by him. And so when I prayed and

440
01:06:17.949 --> 01:06:24.850
surrendered, and even while I was praying, I was angry and crying at the same time and said, God, I

441
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:35.229
don't understand and you hurt me and the words just came out, but I forgive you. It, it felt weird

442
01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:43.169
that I had to forgive God, but I honestly felt a release after that, the burden soon disappeared.

443
01:06:43.179 --> 01:06:50.689
And since then, he has been replacing it with his thoughts towards me and his wisdom. You see, when

444
01:06:50.699 --> 01:06:58.570
God gives us His wisdom, it gives us a better understanding of what we are going through. And we are

445
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:06.500
able to trust that He knows where this is going and that He will fulfill his plans and promises over

446
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:14.489
our lives. So where I'm at now in my walk towards the Lord is stronger than ever. Not because he

447
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:22.250
answered all my questions or answered all my prayer requests. It became stronger because he carried

448
01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:30.300
me through all throughout the wilderness season. And brought me to a deeper, brought me to a place

449
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:37.899
of a deeper understanding of Him, God, the Father Jesus and the Holy Spirit. And I realized now that

450
01:07:37.909 --> 01:07:44.280
there are things that he revealed, there are things that he revealed to me now that even if he told

451
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:51.000
me back then during that wilderness season, I would not even understand. So I see the purposes in my

452
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:58.100
life much clearer now and the wilderness had to be a part of my journey. Because if I didn't go

453
01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:03.949
through that, then I wouldn't have the wisdom and the strength that I have now. And most specially I

454
01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:12.179
have to have this new strength that comes from God alone because I'm still in the waiting season.

455
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:18.709
I'm still waiting for God to fulfill his promise over my life. And even though it hasn't come to

456
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:26.850
fruition, what's important for me now is that I have come to a greater understanding of who He is.

457
01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:37.270
In my life. And that is He is my promise keeper, my, my protector, the shepherd of my soul. He is my

458
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:45.680
Jehovah Jireh, my provider, the one who supplies my every need. He is my Jehovah Rapha, the one who

459
01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:54.339
restores and heals. He is my Jehovah Shalom, the one who gives me peace and he is my Jehovah Rohi,

460
01:08:54.350 --> 01:09:01.918
my faithful shepherd who leads me. So I wanted to declare God's goodness and faithfulness in my life.

461
01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:09.088
That is, which is why I decided to get re baptized. And this decision is a public declaration

462
01:09:09.099 --> 01:09:15.008
of my renewed faith and trust in Him. So thank you for listening to my story.

463
01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:41.290
And so Prell based on your confession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of the father and of the

464
01:09:41.299 --> 01:09:44.770
son and of the Holy Spirit. One God. Amen.

465
01:09:54.959 --> 01:10:02.180
OK. And so Lord, we want to pray over pray and we thank you for the journey that she's been on. She

466
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:09.669
so eloquently just described everything that she's been through and sure she wanted to honor you

467
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:19.959
today and she wanted to make sure that we understood how she also didn't always honor you. But the

468
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:27.609
day is a day in which she has left the past behind and she's been given a new beginning and a new

469
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:34.220
way to live for you with Mac Andre. We thank you for the way that you brought them into each other's

470
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:43.350
lives knowing that together they would be reunited with you. Lord, you reconciled them to yourself

471
01:10:43.359 --> 01:10:51.100
and then brought them into a deeper relationship with you. And today, we are witnesses to how you

472
01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:57.529
have put your hand of a blessing upon pro's life. If you've led her to this moment and to this point

473
01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:04.049
and for the great things that you are still going to do in her life, whatever is unfinished,

474
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:14.359
whatever is still in her heart, waiting for fulfillment. We wanna pray right now that your promises

475
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:20.930
would be fulfilled in her life. In Jesus name, we pray it. Amen. Amen.

476
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.890
Praise God. Tim. Would you come?

477
01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:38.939
Would you welcome Tim?

478
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.529
Good morning, everyone. Uh just like first want to say sorry for any distraction my youngest son

479
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:14.370
may have caused anyone. Uh One of the many miracles that he has left me with a little, a little

480
01:12:14.379 --> 01:12:20.299
background on me. Um I was baptized when I was a kid under Catholic faith. But beyond that, I have

481
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:26.950
no, until becoming an adult. I had no knowledge of anything. Faith, no Bible, no church. I mean,

482
01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:30.959
I've been in the church for maybe a few marriages here and there. But since becoming a Christian,

483
01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:37.169
I've learned a lot more and I wish growing up that I knew what I knew today because growing up, I, I

484
01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:41.379
had to deal with a lot of struggle. I've dealt with suicide addictions so many different things. And

485
01:12:43.779 --> 01:12:50.000
since, since being shown God and the church and Christ, I've been able to overcome all of these

486
01:12:50.009 --> 01:12:54.310
different things. I just want to say a big thanks to my, my wife Maggie. If not for her, I would

487
01:12:54.319 --> 01:13:02.180
have never have known the blessing of God and, and, and her showing me that the, the miracles and

488
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:07.259
how they work, especially her being here today, actually like to be my be the biggest miracle that

489
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:12.379
he has ever. He's ever blessed me with. And some people know I don't want to go too much details,

490
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:16.109
but our kids have been a struggle for, for her personal health and

491
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:24.310
almost lost her with my last one. Then thank God with through prayer, through Him. She is here today.

492
01:13:24.319 --> 01:13:31.100
She's sitting here and I don't have much to say. Unfortunately, my testimony won't be as big as it

493
01:13:31.109 --> 01:13:36.919
won't be as large as the other other wonderful people before me. I just want to see that he has been

494
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:40.939
such a blessing to my life and without him, I don't think I actually would even be alive. I've dealt

495
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:47.689
with, with depression anxiety, I still deal with it. But through Him, I, I am doing much, much

496
01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:53.759
better to, to, you know, coming to church, seeing the church family here and all the other churches

497
01:13:53.770 --> 01:14:00.129
I visited. I have to say this would be the the most family like one I can say, I've ever experienced.

498
01:14:01.299 --> 01:14:05.839
There's been just so many wonderful miracles that he has ever since I've learned in my life. It's

499
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:12.200
just been a miracle after miracle starting with my puppy who had almost passed away. He, he's still

500
01:14:12.209 --> 01:14:14.259
alive. My three wonderful Children, my wife and

501
01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:24.410
II, I asked them to, to forgive me for who I have, who I was before and not to, to forgive me of my

502
01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:30.640
sins and all the transgressions that may have, you know, even spoken ill of him. And I think me

503
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:37.959
being here today is proof that really anyone can if they truly believe, become a follower of, of God

504
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:39.000
and of Christ. And

505
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:45.379
once again, I just want to say thank you to my, my friends, my, my family, those who have been here

506
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:52.649
and helped me grow with my faith. And so I, I really don't have much to say just today. I'm very

507
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.720
happy that I'm able to be here today. So thank you everybody.

508
01:15:21.939 --> 01:15:29.160
And so Tim, based on your confession of faith, I

509
01:15:29.169 --> 01:15:33.759
baptize you in the name of the father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. One God. Amen.

510
01:15:48.379 --> 01:15:55.770
Tim, I thank God for, for you and for your wife Maggie and for your family for the way you

511
01:15:55.779 --> 01:16:02.189
walk through our church doors and for the way that you have been journeying with Jesus. And for the

512
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:08.439
way that you made this decision today to be baptized in water, wanting to give your life to Him more

513
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:15.910
fully in obedience. Recognizing that he had died on the cross for you. You wanted to die to the old

514
01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:23.410
life and be raised in the new life that Jesus was giving you. Thank you for all that God has done

515
01:16:23.419 --> 01:16:29.520
and shown you already. But I know that there is so much more that He wants to reveal so much more

516
01:16:29.529 --> 01:16:34.759
that he wants to bring about in, in change in your life. And I know that God will accomplish that

517
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:44.020
with each step that you continue to take towards him, obeying His word, putting you family first and

518
01:16:44.049 --> 01:16:51.169
loving God with all of your heart. Thank you today. Then Lord, we can rejoice with him and we pray

519
01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.640
these things in Jesus name. Amen.

520
01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:07.970
I'm gonna ask the, the worship team to come up on stage for a song. It's uh it's a beautiful song

521
01:17:07.979 --> 01:17:12.859
that I think we can sing together. Would you guys just stand with me? And it's, it's a new name

522
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:18.540
that's written down in glory. I think that's an appropriate song and it's gonna be a great moment

523
01:17:18.549 --> 01:17:24.040
for us to be able to just celebrate that together. And so let's uh let's take a moment to sing this

524
01:17:24.049 --> 01:17:28.379
song together. Amadea is gonna come out um and just share some announcements in just a few moments.

525
01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:31.000
Uh Please don't leave. We're not done.

526
01:18:10.939 --> 01:18:12.120

527
01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:15.810

573
01:24:02.589 --> 01:24:08.209
mission within this house and outside. So we thank you in advance for that. Uh There are four ways

574
01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:14.285
to give, we try to make it as easy as possible and just know that you're giving to God first and

575
01:24:14.294 --> 01:24:20.004
he's allowing us to help bless his people with your donations. So thank you in advance for that.

576
01:24:20.225 --> 01:24:26.234
Pastor Lorenzo is coming out. He has a brief word for us. So let's give it up for him and we will

577
01:24:26.245 --> 01:24:27.325
see him shortly.

578
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:39.490
Hey, everyone,

579
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:50.129
normally we, um we, we end at this time, uh are gathering, uh, and, and obviously when we have

580
01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:58.629
baptisms, um it's always a special moment where um the service is gonna take a little longer. And,

581
01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:05.129
uh and we didn't want to cut anything out because it's such a, a powerful and significant moment for

582
01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:13.629
uh the people who have made this decision. Can we give it up one more time for our baptized people

583
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.859
in our community of faith?

584
01:25:18.439 --> 01:25:25.080
We're in this series called uh rejected. That is beginning today. And one of the things that I've

585
01:25:25.089 --> 01:25:30.279
learned to do as a, as a sports team chaplain as I represent the sports teams in the city of

586
01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:36.609
Montreal is to give a 10 minute message who wants to put me to that test right now?

587
01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:47.149
I am, I'm really good at it. In fact, I was so good at it yesterday that the Alouettes won their

588
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.240
game yesterday.

589
01:25:53.790 --> 01:26:01.000
So if you doubt my ability today, I will prove that I can do this. Let's go.

590
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:08.939
But one of the things about rejection that I think all of us can, can understand and relate. And I

591
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:17.540
think the most difficult is how we can be rejected by our own families. And I really wanted to start

592
01:26:17.549 --> 01:26:24.100
there today and, and, and just because, you know, today is a day about celebrating people who have

593
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:31.560
made a decision to be a part of the family of God and, and, and to have uh a, a renewed relationship

594
01:26:31.569 --> 01:26:37.430
with, with the Lord. And that many of us, when we make that decision to follow Jesus, sometimes we

595
01:26:37.439 --> 01:26:44.939
can find rejection from our family. Sometimes it's, it happens much sooner, much earlier. But you

596
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:51.350
may be surprised to hear and to know and to understand that Jesus experienced rejection by his own

597
01:26:51.359 --> 01:27:00.069
family. In fact, I'm gonna show you in this story how different we have may have understood the

598
01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:06.169
story of Jesus' life. Today, we're gonna look in Mark chapter three and we're gonna see something

599
01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:12.399
that we may have never seen before and understand it in a way that I believe is gonna profoundly

600
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:21.669
change the way that we deal with rejection from our family. Like never before you see the principles

601
01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:28.439
that we're gonna be able to acquire from the life of Jesus is going to leave us understanding how to

602
01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:38.649
deal with that rejection in our own lives. I want us to begin and understanding that Jesus was risen

603
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:47.399
to rain. He was born to do this and, and the moment that he enters onto the scene, he's performing

604
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:56.009
miracles and the crowds just keep getting bigger. There isn't a moment in which Jesus isn't having a

605
01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:02.270
hard time keeping the crowds away. In fact, there's a moment in chapter three, verse 20 when Jesus

606
01:28:02.279 --> 01:28:10.009
enters a house and a crowd gathered there and the disciples weren't even able to eat. This wasn't

607
01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:16.839
even a moment that was open to other people. But this is how popular Jesus had become. The crowds

608
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:23.709
were pressing in and entering houses where he was trying to have a private meal, even with his

609
01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:32.660
disciples. And then the scriptures tell us that something else was also happening in this story that

610
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:42.899
even though Jesus was risen to reign, there was still his family who didn't understand this and they

611
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:51.390
were actually set in their hearts to reject who he was becoming, they couldn't handle it. You see,

612
01:28:52.609 --> 01:28:57.640
they couldn't understand it, they couldn't accept it and they were doing everything possible in

613
01:28:57.649 --> 01:29:08.430
their own lives to try to almost squash it out. Have you ever felt like someone was trying to squash

614
01:29:08.439 --> 01:29:17.680
you out, trying to keep you down, trying to make sure that you didn't rise to your full potential

615
01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:27.229
that instead of celebrating you, they were there to criticize you, they were there to condemn you.

616
01:29:29.049 --> 01:29:35.379
And this is exactly what was happening in Jesus' life. Here he is the crowds are loving Jesus, but

617
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:44.669
his own family can't accept it. It says that in verse 31 of this chapter that Jesus' mothers and

618
01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:52.029
brothers arrived and they stand outside and they had to send someone in to call him out. And the

619
01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:58.069
Bible tells us in verse 32 that a crowd was sitting around him and they told him your mother and

620
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.959
brothers are outside, they're looking for you. And then he asked this question that you may have

621
01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:12.899
heard before. Who are my mother and my brothers? He asked. And it's interesting because in this

622
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:20.240
moment in a moment, in which others are reclaiming him, Jesus doesn't acknowledge who his own family

623
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:26.299
is. And people have often misinterpreted what is happening in this moment. And I want you to

624
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:34.410
understand what happens next because we get it when religious people reject us. I think the church

625
01:30:34.419 --> 01:30:42.109
has done an incredibly good job at rejecting people. Anybody disagree with that. Like most of us at

626
01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:48.890
some point have felt like we don't belong, that we're not good enough that, that, that being in a

627
01:30:48.899 --> 01:30:53.799
relationship with God is just too hard, too complicated. There's too many rules, there's too many

628
01:30:53.810 --> 01:31:01.220
expectations and I can't even begin to meet some of them. And so many of us walk away from God

629
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:07.540
because we are being rejected by religion itself. You know, we just saw baptism take place and you

630
01:31:07.549 --> 01:31:12.620
know what's interesting about baptism and, and in the courts that I teach. Iii, I explain that when

631
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:23.709
people get baptized, they are joining a religion, they are rejecting it. You see, Jesus comes and

632
01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:30.359
rejects the status quo. He rejects the temple system. He rejects everything that was there because

633
01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:42.029
he's come to reveal something new. You see, we are not joining anything. When we get baptized, when

634
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:49.209
we get baptized, we are rejecting religion and we are embracing relationship with God.

635
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.169
That's what it means.

636
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:02.709
And all of a sudden, Jesus is saying, who are my brothers and who are my sisters, who are, who is my

637
01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.509
mother. And we understand being rejected by the religious because in Mark three, look at what

638
01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:16.770
happens in verse 22 the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said he is possessed by

639
01:32:16.779 --> 01:32:22.520
Beelzebub like he's, he's possessed by Satan is what they're saying. And he's saying that by the

640
01:32:22.529 --> 01:32:29.350
very prince of demons, he's driving out demons. They're saying this is how Jesus has the power to do

641
01:32:29.359 --> 01:32:38.140
these things. And so the religious leaders are saying he is a cult leader. They're saying that he is

642
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:46.609
under the power and the influence of Satan that that's why demons obey him. And so Jesus doesn't

643
01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:54.979
just get rejected by his family, he gets rejected by the religious. But it goes even further than

644
01:32:54.990 --> 01:33:03.740
that. Look at how he gets rejected by his family in Mark chapter three. And in verse 21. So now

645
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:11.430
we're discovering why his family came to get Jesus in the house. Remember they came to ask for him

646
01:33:11.439 --> 01:33:20.240
to come outside. Now in verse 21 it says that when his family heard about Jesus' rise, look at what

647
01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:31.390
happens. They went to take charge of him because they said he is out of his mind. Did you ever think

648
01:33:31.399 --> 01:33:32.520
that was in the scriptures?

649
01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:41.589
II? I think most of us have missed this point where they actually thought that Jesus was crazy

650
01:33:43.689 --> 01:33:50.620
that even though he was performing miracles, we see that not only do the religious leaders reject

651
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:57.259
him, but now we're seeing that his family does see when his family shows up at the door, asking

652
01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:04.129
Jesus to come out. Jesus knows that their intention isn't to celebrate him. It's to take charge of

653
01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:12.229
him because they think he's lost his mind. This is Jesus, we're talking about this. This is Jesus

654
01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.049
who actually performed real miracles and then the people witnessed them and that's why the crowds

655
01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:24.990
kept getting larger because they experienced these miracles. And then imagine that as this happened

656
01:34:25.419 --> 01:34:32.620
and as this was taking place, people couldn't understand but what they could understand was what

657
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:39.229
they were seeing and what they're seeing was miracle after miracle. And they knew that they were in

658
01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:49.660
need of miracles. But instead of celebrating that his family came out to silence him. I look at that

659
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:57.020
and I say, Lord, how, how am I gonna reject rejection? But when I look in this story, I see that

660
01:34:57.029 --> 01:35:03.430
there's some keys that, that God gives us in understanding how in Matthew and, and, and again, in

661
01:35:03.439 --> 01:35:08.859
other gospels, the story is told a little differently. But in Mark, I especially love the way it's

662
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:15.970
described in Mark three. It says that if a kingdom is divided against itself, then that kingdom

663
01:35:15.979 --> 01:35:22.649
cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, then that house cannot stand. And what Jesus

664
01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:27.569
says is that this is what it looks like when you're divided, you see when you're divided, it's

665
01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:36.200
because you have let rejection take a hold of you. You've let rejection limit you, you've let it

666
01:35:36.209 --> 01:35:45.600
condemn you, you've allowed it to control you. And so how do you expect to build a kingdom? How many

667
01:35:45.609 --> 01:35:51.649
people here believe that they are kings and queens in the kingdom of God? You see most of us would

668
01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:59.209
say no, I don't, I don't know. I mean, I want to be, but most days I don't feel like that. But what

669
01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:06.850
God is saying is that if you live by the standard of rejection, then you will never be able to build

670
01:36:06.859 --> 01:36:14.479
the kingdom that God is asking you to build, you will not be able to have a house because your house

671
01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:20.589
is divided against itself. You see when you believe the rejection that comes by religion and you

672
01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:27.399
believe the rejection that may have come by your family, your kingdom and your house is divided and

673
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:34.189
you are therefore incapable of building anything that stands. And God is saying, I don't want that

674
01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:40.569
to be your life. I don't want that to be you. I want you to build a great kingdom. I want you to

675
01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:47.740
have a great house. I want you to do great things and experience the greatness of God. I want that

676
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:55.169
for you. But I also know that if I can just keep you under the oppression of rejection, I can keep

677
01:36:55.180 --> 01:37:02.229
that from happening, Satan saying. And so Jesus reveals that this is what the religious leaders were

678
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:08.319
teaching and what they thought. And he's saying, I want you to understand that I cast out demons. I

679
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:10.520
am not controlled by them.

680
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:19.580
I make sure that the kingdom of God is built so that demons don't have power over me or anyone else.

681
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:27.310
If anyone has been held back by any power that is evil, I'm gonna come against that. That's what

682
01:37:27.319 --> 01:37:34.740
Jesus promises. And then he says something else that's really important. It's this don't be tied up

683
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:41.979
by rejection, but I want you to tie up the strong men. Instead, the Bible tells us that Jesus says

684
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:48.169
this in verse 27. He says, in fact, no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up

685
01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:53.580
and then he can plunder the strong man's house. And here's what I know, here's what I've come to

686
01:37:53.589 --> 01:38:00.290
understand. And I want us to put this back up there. I don't want you to be tied up by rejection. I

687
01:38:00.299 --> 01:38:08.970
want you to tie up the strong men. Instead, many of us are being tied up by rejection. And because

688
01:38:08.979 --> 01:38:15.560
we are tied up by rejection, our kingdom cannot be helped. Our house cannot be helped. Nothing is

689
01:38:15.569 --> 01:38:22.390
being built. We find ourselves under that oppression, day in and day out. And we are wondering why

690
01:38:22.399 --> 01:38:29.459
time keeps passing and nothing is changing. And the reason is we have not bound the strong man. And

691
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:35.569
in this story, I want you to know that the strong man is rejection. This whole story is about

692
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:42.089
rejection. It's about how his family rejected him. It's about how the religious leaders rejected him.

693
01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:49.040
It is how he will not allow himself to live under that rejection. And if you want to come out from

694
01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:56.509
all the stuff that is weighing you down, you gotta tie the strong man first and unless you tie the

695
01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:03.250
strong man, which is rejection, your house cannot be built. Are you ready to tie that up? Are you

696
01:39:03.259 --> 01:39:04.910
ready to tie that up in your life?

697
01:39:08.479 --> 01:39:13.950
And so then God says, here's how it's gonna work here is how you tie up the strong man. Here is how

698
01:39:13.959 --> 01:39:18.270
you tie up rejection and it's going to be the way that you don't want to do it. But here it comes

699
01:39:18.279 --> 01:39:27.770
anyways, it says release yourself from injection through forgiveness. You see, forgiveness is key in

700
01:39:27.779 --> 01:39:32.959
being able to bind that strong man. I want you to think about how his own family thought he was

701
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:36.970
crazy and they came to take charge of him and bring him back home and they weren't going to let him

702
01:39:36.979 --> 01:39:42.649
go out again. I don't know what they did in those days, but I do know what they do today when people

703
01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.500
are not. Well, they put them under house arrest, they put them in institutions. They, they, they,

704
01:39:47.509 --> 01:39:53.799
they, they make sure that they are no longer interacting with other people. And I believe that this

705
01:39:53.810 --> 01:40:00.589
family thought that he was bringing their family name down. Can you imagine that they had to

706
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:07.509
interfere, keeping Jesus out of the spotlight and out of the community because they thought it was

707
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:14.990
going to damage their family name. It was gonna bring disrepute because even the religious leaders

708
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:24.850
felt the same. But here it says in verse 28 and these are Jesus' words. Truly, I tell you people can

709
01:40:24.859 --> 01:40:30.950
be forgiven all their sins. Look at this and every slander that they utter.

710
01:40:33.529 --> 01:40:42.120
Now Jesus says everything gets forgiven and every slanderous word that is spoken gets forgiven to

711
01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:47.740
what Jesus is saying is that I have forgiven every sin against me and I have forgiven every

712
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:54.200
slanderous word against me too. It doesn't matter that it came from my family. It doesn't matter

713
01:40:54.209 --> 01:40:59.580
that it came from the religious leaders. It doesn't matter that they want to lock me up. It doesn't

714
01:40:59.589 --> 01:41:04.279
matter that every day I go out there and I prove that I can only do this by the power of God. It

715
01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:12.339
doesn't matter what matters is I will forgive them. You want to bind the strong man. It is through

716
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:17.709
forgiveness. Are you ready to do that? Are you ready to accomplish that in your life? See, that's

717
01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.779
the only way that it's gonna happen and, and here's what I know guys. It's, it's so clear to me now

718
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:29.359
that, that we tend to reflect and repeat the rejection that we have experienced. It's so clear to me

719
01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:35.169
now that sometimes our apology just isn't good enough. Sometimes we're the reason why people are

720
01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:41.870
rejecting us. I get it. Sometimes people are rejecting us and it's hard to, to wait for an apology

721
01:41:41.879 --> 01:41:51.919
from them. But here's what I've come to understand. Your apology doesn't need relationship. And what

722
01:41:51.930 --> 01:41:57.299
I mean by that is that sometimes when we apologize to people and I've made this mistake so I can

723
01:41:57.310 --> 01:42:05.069
talk earnestly about it in the moment that I'm giving my apology. I want to explain myself. Have you

724
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:11.490
ever done that? It's like I have to explain to you why I did it. I'm sorry, but here's why I did it

725
01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.680
and you know why the person never receives it. Well, because in that moment, there is no

726
01:42:16.689 --> 01:42:24.939
relationship to receive it. You see, the person is willing to accept your apology, but they're not

727
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:31.979
yet ready for a relationship. You see what is different with God is that He's not just ready to

728
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:38.109
receive your apology. He's been waiting to restore that relationship,

729
01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:48.649
but people don't respond that way. And, and so you have to be clear on this when it comes time to

730
01:42:48.660 --> 01:43:00.250
apologize, just apologize because God will then create a path for reconciliation to take place and

731
01:43:00.259 --> 01:43:05.930
for a relationship to be restored. Can you say amen to that? Can you say amen that? Can you, can you

732
01:43:05.939 --> 01:43:06.939
agree right now?

733
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:16.459
You see that's how this is gonna work and God is giving us the steps in how to make that happen. The

734
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:24.459
last thing that He does is that he says, rejection doesn't need to lead to retaliation. In Mark

735
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:30.689
chapter three in verse 14, he could retaliate against the religious leaders. He could retaliate

736
01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:35.169
against his own family, but he doesn't, he chooses to forgive them. And because of that, he

737
01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:40.759
experiences something else, it tells us in chapter three and verse 14, that Jesus did something

738
01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:47.189
knowing that he would not have acceptance from the religious leaders or from his own family. He

739
01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:56.859
appoints 12 apostles that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach and that

740
01:43:56.870 --> 01:44:03.009
they together would have authority to drive out demons. Can we say amen to that? See what Jesus does

741
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:11.200
is that He chooses the people that he's gonna do life with, he appoints them. And then in mark three,

742
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:19.490
look at this in verse 33 when he asks the question, who are my mother and my brothers? He asks in

743
01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:24.709
verse 34 look at what he does. He looks at those that are seated in a circle

744
01:44:27.439 --> 01:44:37.180
and he says, here are my mother and my brothers. And when his parents had come to take charge of him,

745
01:44:37.890 --> 01:44:45.149
he had a room full of people who had not rejected him but had believed in him instead. Hallelujah,

746
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:53.709
thank you Lord, that you can bring people into our lives that when our family rejects us, when

747
01:44:53.720 --> 01:45:02.370
religion rejects us, that you can bring people into our lives, who can accept us and remind us of

748
01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:08.649
the acceptance that we have already in Jesus Christ that we have in God, the blessing that he has

749
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:18.100
for us. It says this that he looked at those people, the 12, the 12 that he had pointed, not

750
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:24.660
everybody in the crowd, not all those that were there to see yet another miracle or to receive

751
01:45:24.669 --> 01:45:30.990
something from Jesus, but those who are willing to journey with him every step of the way you see.

752
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.959
Those were the ones that he needed to be accepted by. And those were the ones who he turned to and

753
01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:47.540
said you are my brothers, you're my family. And here's what this means. It means that we have to

754
01:45:47.549 --> 01:45:56.490
move past rejection. And when our family rejects us. Here's what we need to do. You need to choose

755
01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.580
your family instead,

756
01:46:00.169 --> 01:46:01.549
you need to choose it instead.

757
01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:08.129
You see if your family rejects you, it's OK. You'll be just like Jesus.

758
01:46:10.979 --> 01:46:19.029
But then what Jesus did is that he chose his family and he allowed himself to be surrounded by the

759
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:28.870
chosen and together they drove out every demon so that the kingdom of God could be built

760
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:38.609
so that their house would not be divided. But so that they would experience full acceptance in the

761
01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:45.060
eyes of God. Are you ready to see that acceptance? Everybody said I have that in your life.

762
01:46:52.729 --> 01:46:58.879
Stop thinking about who rejected you and start thinking about who you're supposed to choose to be in

763
01:46:58.890 --> 01:46:59.490
your life.

764
01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.479
Amen, Bedo.

765
01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:14.009
So that we can take the next steps in the kingdom that God is telling us to build in the house that

766
01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:21.680
will not be divided. Amen. Alright, let's wrap it up. Would you stand with me as we close?

767
01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:26.490
I know that was 10 minutes times 10. But

768
01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.640
I don't, I don't have a coach like yelling at me to wrap it up.

769
01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.729
Lord, I want to thank you for every person here and for the truth that have been revealed in this

770
01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:44.259
story and for the way that you have shown us what acceptance looks like and what we need to do to

771
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:53.430
experience that Lord, you said that you were able to forgive every action, every word every

772
01:47:53.439 --> 01:48:01.919
slanderous word. Would you help us to do that too? So we can bind the strong man in our life. So we

773
01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:09.930
stop living with rejection and experience the acceptance that we already have in. You. Lord, this

774
01:48:09.939 --> 01:48:16.100
room is filled with kings and queens whose kingdoms you want to help build, whose houses that you

775
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:23.120
want to stand firm and undivided. And today, oh God, we declare that that would happen and I pray

776
01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:30.000
that if there be anything that is oppressing us, that is condemning us, that in Jesus' name, we

777
01:48:30.009 --> 01:48:35.189
would be set free from that right now. Thank you for today, for the, for those that were baptized.

778
01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.649
Thank you for every person here who's been baptized under your spirit right now and for the changes

779
01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:47.859
that you're gonna bring about in our lives. Lord show us what to do next. But I pray to be clear to

780
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:55.560
us all, Lord, we can choose our family right now. And so if we've been rejected by our family, I

781
01:48:55.569 --> 01:49:02.509
pray, Lord, I know that's a pain that cannot be healed on our own. So we bind that strong man. We

782
01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:08.700
bind it in Jesus name and we ask that you would heal us, deliver us and that you bring restoration

783
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:13.350
into our lives. Thank you for everything that you've done and everything that you're going to do for

784
01:49:13.359 --> 01:49:21.770
each of us and for the way that we can leave rejection behind and accept your full and unquestioned

785
01:49:21.779 --> 01:49:28.229
acceptance right now, help us to choose our family, help us to bring the right people into our lives

786
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:37.859
so we can build and build and give glory and honor to your name in Jesus name. We pray. Amen. Amen.

787
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:44.919
I hope you received that today. So if you're willing to stick around, we've got the after party.

788
