00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:29.860
Good morning, River's Edge. Welcome back another wonderful Sunday for you. It's a really powerful

2
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:39.990
Sunday for us as a community. It's baptism Sunday. And so we have four brave people coming up today

3
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:47.470
to share their stories and to be baptized into the family of Christ. So we're really excited and

4
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.440
we're going to be supporting them through their journey today. Um, Past Lorenzo has a fantastic

5
00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.980
message for us. It's from our message series, joyful expectations. Today's message is called

6
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:08.860
silencing self doubt. Anybody in the room have a little self doubt they need to silence. I'll go

7
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:17.880
first. I do. So today is a good place to be here. Um, we want to remind you that um, River's Edge is

8
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:24.170
really a community where you belong before you believe. We want you to come. We want you to bring

9
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:30.245
friends and family and know that we are a group of imperfect people just doing our best for each

10
00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:36.955
other and God and we want you to feel seen and loved and encouraged. So come on out and join us and

11
00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:43.835
and bring the people that you love. Um, so let's prepare our hearts, let's stand up, let's get ready

12
00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:47.750
to thank God for giving us another day and the worship team is going to take it away.

20
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.150
Thank you for being in the house of the Lord with us

21
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.240
and let's look forward to these baptisms.

23
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:38.470
person who's being baptized in water and um, and it's important for us to understand something and I

24
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:44.830
feel like I have to mention this because I think people are often confused by this and that is that

25
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:52.210
these four individuals are not getting baptized into a denomination because we are a non

26
00:14:52.210 --> 00:15:00.340
denominational church, they're not getting baptized into a church, but they are being baptized into

27
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:10.070
the body of Christ, they're being baptized to follow Jesus and we are a community of faith that is

28
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:17.820
committed to following Jesus and what we are witnessing today are people who have already received

29
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:24.930
Jesus into their heart and into their life and the decision that they have now made is being made

30
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:35.690
public now Jesus went to the cross, so none of us would have to go. And so he tells us that baptism

31
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:45.070
is what represents the cross, the death, the burial, and then the resurrection of our Lord and

32
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:53.660
savior, Jesus Christ. And so the thing that he asks of us is to be baptized in water. Now, the other

33
00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:00.880
thing that we can sometimes be confused about is why we are doing it by immersion, why is the person

34
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.720
being fully immersed, the person is being fully immersed in water because that was the only way that

35
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:15.970
it was done in the early church and even as the church expanded and went worldwide For the greater

36
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:22.810
part of almost 400 years, that's how it was always done and then things began to change from there.

37
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:31.800
So historically this was the only way that people got baptized, not on the stage in the church, but

38
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:41.930
being fully immersed why, because it represents a grave, the burial having to die is so important,

39
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:50.730
so essential. And then when we bring them back up and I promise to do that, it will represent the

40
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:57.190
resurrection and they'll be surprised too, and it's gonna feel like they were dying and then they're

41
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:04.530
brought to life and then we're gonna cheer them on and celebrate this and they're doing it at a time

42
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:11.560
and at an age in which it's also their decision and it's so important that we understand this, like

43
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:18.240
when people do it for us, it's amazing, but the day has to come when we have to decide for ourselves

44
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:24.730
and this is a day that has come for them. And so the first person who's gonna tell us about her

45
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:30.650
spiritual journey and her decision to be baptized in water is Kirsten. Would you welcome Kirsten

46
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:58.100
At this point? But what I did was I kind of wrote something to God. Um, so I'm gonna share with you

47
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:04.690
if I get a little emotional, please stick with me and help me through it. Okay. Um, so when I was

48
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:10.780
younger I went to church and I was baptized, I did not truly understand what was going on who you

49
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:17.400
were and what a relationship with you was like for about 15 years. I withdrew from you and I remain

50
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:23.370
disconnected. I was reckless and rebellious. Many told me I would burn if I set foot in a church,

51
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.910
luckily you being who you are. You did not give up on me. And looking back throughout those years, I

52
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:35.060
see your attempts to win my heart over around this time, four years ago I was falling and you caught

53
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.970
me. You surrounded me by the best people. Those who would answer my unanswered questions. Those who

54
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.580
took the time to have weekly Bible studies with me, those who showed me that my prayers were being

55
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.990
answered. Sorry, those who have been role models and showed me crazy faith, those who would bring me

56
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:56.320
to church and were part of the belong groups. I attended. Everything was in place for me to get to

57
00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.590
know you and I caved. Finally, you won my heart over this journey with you has not been easy. And

58
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:07.610
honestly part of me thinks that you're making up for lost time. Fortunately I don't consider myself

59
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.580
someone who gives up easily either. I recognize that the trials and tribulations you have put on my

60
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:18.440
path were to break old habits and patterns and to build new ones that align with who you are and who

61
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.220
you intend for me to be. I know you will continue to do so and for this. I'm so grateful. Something

62
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.750
that keeps coming to mind as I'm writing. This comes from established school session. The weekly

63
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:34.540
lesson and discussion was about when you saved the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, you gave Moses

64
00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:40.490
what is referred to as the 10 commandments. However, what's what stays present in my mind is that

65
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.310
they are not grammatically written as commandments, but a form in hebrew. That implies specific

66
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:51.100
promises of what can happen in the future. Having discussed the Decalogue in more detail, I saw a

67
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:57.160
beauty that hadn't seen before. You are not imposing them on me. You're not saying that I must do

68
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.500
these things in order to be with you, but rather these things will happen by walking with you. This

69
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.330
is what your future looks like by following me. I know it doesn't mean the devil won't be knocking

70
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:13.210
at my door with temptation. However, these changes will happen more naturally by following you. I

71
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:17.580
would like to end by saying that I know I'm at the beginning of the journey and there are tough

72
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:23.320
times ahead and this is why I'm here today getting baptized because I can't do life without you

73
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:29.160
baptisms represent the washing away of sins. And in addition to that I'm making a promise. A vow

74
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:34.940
that no matter what I'm choosing you, I'm allowing you to infiltrate every part of my being and

75
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:40.570
every sphere of my life. So I may become the person you have created me to be. So you can use me for

76
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:46.950
your purpose and when times get tough, that you may be the first I turn to for guidance for you are

77
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.390
not only my creator, but you are my father, the one who knows me and every and my every intention

78
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:58.050
behind every action. You know my past, present and future and you will never leave me. So who better

79
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.240
to have by my side to guide me through the journey of my life. But you

80
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:20.940
so you three, I want you up here with her. Come up through, let's go, let's go.

81
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:23.690
Yeah,

82
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.380
let's go up up, come on,

83
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.580
see that, it's awesome.

84
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:50.020
Come up, come up. You guys are a big part of this and it's important. What? That's it. Beautiful.

85
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.860
Yeah,

86
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.000
let me just come right in.

87
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:04.120
Okay, take a seat that's beautiful. You want to hold your nose

88
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:12.890
And so based on your confession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of the father and of the son

89
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.680
and of the Holy Spirit one. God Amen.

90
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.920
Just in case for you.

91
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:34.590
It's a father based on her confession of faith. Having been baptized, just like you have commanded

92
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:41.060
to believe and to be baptized. We thank you that she has left her old life behind and literally

93
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:47.680
today she has been made new. We thank you for how you have great things in store for her for the

94
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.820
blessings that are to come for the great things that you're going to reveal even through the

95
00:22:52.820 --> 00:23:01.470
challenges and through the adverse circumstances, you were with her. You are always for her and you

96
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:09.000
will give her the victory in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. It's

97
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.100
that's amazing.

98
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:24.470
All right. So the great news is that we still have three more people that are gonna be baptized

99
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.920
today.

100
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.690
And so the second person that is being called up

101
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.680
removing is Deborah, would you welcome Deborah?

102
00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:04.450
Hi everybody, sorry, I didn't prepare, like, a full speech. I just wanna say what's coming to my heart

103
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:15.900
right now? I was thinking about getting baptized for a long time now. Um but somehow I had some

104
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:24.740
things holding me back, especially because my family is from a different background and I still

105
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:32.290
don't know how they will take the news, but something changed inside me and I just feel so ready to

106
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:43.640
take this next step and start this new life, this stronger and greater relationship with Jesus. Uh I

107
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:53.040
have accepted him into my life already and uh I just think it's a such powerful way to show him and

108
00:24:53.050 --> 00:25:04.490
everybody that I really want to have this new life And yeah, um I feel 100% ready for that and

109
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.430
that's why I'm here. Thank you for sharing.

110
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:21.190
So Deborah's family, this is Alex, the husband and um mother in law to Deborah, it's Alex's mom and

111
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:29.290
that's theo their little boy. That's awesome. Beautiful family. And I know it's been a challenging

112
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.200
time, brazil is out of the world Cup.

113
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:42.030
But today's a good day. You see, you know, even at the worst of circumstances, God can still bless

114
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:42.380
right,

115
00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:57.400
awesome. That's it. That's it your nose. So Debra based on your confession of faith, I baptize you

116
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.790
in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit.

117
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:22.820
And so father even over Deborah, we pray a prayer of blessing. She has obeyed you and your

118
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:30.010
commandment to be baptized in water. And when we obey you, we grow in our faith. When we obey you,

119
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:38.510
you show us new things and you do new things and we pray this over Debra's life. That you would

120
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:44.070
reveal yourself like never before that you would teach her the things of your word, that she would

121
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.620
have insight that you would expand her faith. That you would open her eyes and her heart like never

122
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:55.240
before. And thank you Lord for the things that you're gonna put on her path that are gonna bless her

123
00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:03.620
life and her spiritual journey. But also her everyday life with her husband and with her family

124
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:10.480
and for all the things that you have in store for them and we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

125
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.400
Amen.

126
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:35.620
That's good. That's alright, bless you man. It's a big thing.

127
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:50.320
And so we've got one more uh, before we had the last one her name. You saw how I recovered there

128
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:59.990
kind of um, so would you welcome Jessica to the stage.

129
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:09.700
Mm

130
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.310
So I came to this church

131
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:36.620
as a child and was baptized exactly here with my sister. I didn't expect to be back here again,

132
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.770
being immersed with my man.

133
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:53.270
But here I am back here. Um, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to see this, but

134
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.700
this seemed a proposed and kind of actually almost came to me in.

135
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.300
I don't know how to explain those digits.

136
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:17.990
This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you, God is light in him. There is no

137
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.080
darkness Darkness at all.

138
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.270
If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness,

139
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.700
we lie and do not

140
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.430
live out the truth. I'm going to start again.

141
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:46.860
This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you, God is light in him. There is no

142
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:54.130
darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do

143
00:29:54.130 --> 00:30:02.370
not live out the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with

144
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:10.980
one another and the blood of Jesus, his son purifies us from all sin. If we claim to be without sin,

145
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:18.610
we deceive ourselves. And the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just

146
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:26.140
and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all in righteousness. If we claim we have not sinned,

147
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:32.660
we make out, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.

148
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.640
So I'm

149
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:52.710
hoping that today is going to be a new day, hoping that tomorrow is gonna be another new day and

150
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:58.990
keep on going from there is I can be forgiven

151
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:04.300
through all of this

152
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.670
and I know I can I can forgive others and I can forgive myself

153
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.000
And from there I hope to go on

154
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.230
to glorify God. Um

155
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.850
if not the results at least in the effort and in the intention.

156
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.270
Yeah.

157
00:31:51.590 --> 00:32:03.400
Come, I'll help you. Yeah. Just walk to the end. Be careful here.

158
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:16.370
So Jessica and Peter are husband and wife and they're both being baptized today. Uh They just

159
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:23.840
finished their Alpha course yesterday. And and they've been coming to yeah, it's amazing.

160
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:35.450
And they've been uh coming to this church as soon as we reopened after the pandemic. And and Jessica

161
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:41.400
mentioned that she was actually baptized here as a little girl when it was an irish Roman catholic

162
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:52.490
church called ST Augustine of Canterbury. And and today she's being baptized as an adult by her own

163
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:57.010
choosing. Having made a decision to follow Jesus amen

164
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:03.460
you ready,

165
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.930
Jessica based on your confession of faith. I baptize you in the name of the father and of the son of

166
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.620
the Holy spirit one God.

167
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.160
I'll just pray for you.

168
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:37.350
Jessica. That that old life has been left behind. It's what you wanted and it's what's happened in

169
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:46.710
Jesus name, you were free of all that has been holding you back. It can hold you back no more. We

170
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:52.690
want to pray right now that you would be filled with the Holy Spirit and that you would walk with

171
00:33:52.700 --> 00:34:02.270
Jesus every day and on the days when he will need to be there for you and carry you and hold you

172
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:11.780
close, he will show you how you can walk with him again. And so right now we pray that everything

173
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.470
that is in front of you is greater than anything that you're leaving behind. Let me pray this in

174
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.650
Jesus' name, amen.

175
00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:33.560
I told you, I told you would feel it. That's awesome

176
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.100
There you go,

177
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.910
good pete

178
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:54.880
morning,

179
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.920
let me just fix this.

180
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.460
I don't have anything prepared really.

181
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:16.140
I try to think of when it was that brought me here, what was the first moment that

182
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.010
made me want to do this?

183
00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:31.470
And there's many answers, but I think the first thing That I heard about Jesus, that actually made

184
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.080
sense to me, I must have been 25

185
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.540
and someone said

186
00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:46.210
what would Jesus do? And I'd never heard that

187
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:57.170
and I wasn't a believer, but it made sense and I try to remind myself of that as often as I can

188
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:09.000
and even if you don't believe if you live that way, you're gonna make better choices I think. And I

189
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:21.630
imagine a world where everyone does that. And I think if we can think of that first and love each

190
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.340
other more,

191
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.930
really imagine a beautiful world like that.

192
00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.330
And that's all I have to say.

193
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.960
Yeah, let's go over there. Perfect to the end.

194
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:56.270
Mm hmm.

195
00:36:59.180 --> 00:36:59.730
All right.

196
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.620
And so based on your confession of faith, Peter, I now baptize you in the name of the father and of

197
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.670
the son of the Holy Spirit one God. Amen.

198
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.990
Let's pray for you.

199
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:30.280
Lord, we wanna thank you for the way that you have united Peter and Jessica in marriage and today

200
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:37.020
you have also united them in faith together, they've been baptized in obedience to your word. And we

201
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:43.180
just pray that this moment would be a moment that brings them not only closer together, but that

202
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:50.760
helps Peter to be the spiritual leader. He needs to be in his life and in his home with his wife

203
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:57.700
together. Making choices and decisions that would honor you and I pray father that you would bless

204
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:04.280
Peter bless him with his music. Bless him with his talent that you've already given him that he's

205
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:10.920
using for your glory. You know what's on his mind and on his heart, you know what he desires before

206
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:18.080
you and how to use that to honor you and to bless you. I pray father that as he continues to do that

207
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:24.230
both in this church and in community and even in the world Lord, you're going to open doors for him

208
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:31.570
like never before and we thank you for the hand of blessing that is upon his life and for how you

209
00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:38.990
will continue to lead him in Jesus name. We pray Amen Amen 17,

210
00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.460
that's awesome.

211
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:55.320
Alright, so we're gonna continue with our worship and I'll be back in just a few moments with the

212
00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:02.530
message and uh, we'll give you just one more opportunity to just stand if you would as we would sing

213
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:11.910
these next couple of songs and if we could like, um I'm not a shouter myself, so if I was in church

214
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:17.660
like sitting with you, I'd be the, one of the quietest ones in the bunch. Uh I would be, I would be,

215
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.330
I would be like watching everybody else like cheer and clap and do that kind of thing and I probably

216
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:26.000
wouldn't be as exuberant as my wife who's always over the top, but

217
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.180
good,

218
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:38.330
but it's infectious, you know, she's, she's helped me, you know, be more expressive as a result. I

219
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:45.360
had to, you know, sometimes you got to match that energy. Um, but if we can just right now and, and,

220
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:52.580
and not just give it up for the four people that, that got baptized, but just to Jesus for the way

221
00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:58.160
he works not only in their life, but how he's working in ours for the way that he's leading us all

222
00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.150
on a spiritual journey and maybe one day you're gonna feel ready to do this exact same thing that

223
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.970
you just witnessed today, maybe that day is today, maybe it'll come in the days to come, but I'll

224
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:12.390
tell you they never thought they were ready until they were, you know, and and that's how it works

225
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:17.560
and that's how God works in us and he just brings us to a place of conviction and so we will never

226
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:24.920
tell you as a church when you know as a pastor or as anyone that this is what you have to do, see

227
00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:31.010
that they came to that understanding in a relationship with Jesus and they felt the timing was

228
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:37.010
finally right for them and I believe that God is doing that in all of us and so if we believe that

229
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.850
and if we trust God for that, are we ready to just thank Jesus right now and and just bless his name

230
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:47.400
for that. So you're ready to cheer All right, let's do that right now, let's go,

231
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:32.660
sorry about that sound is turned off. Too many things, too many microphones. Alright, we'll keep the

232
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:39.700
energy up. We're gonna sing this song from Mosaic called The One and you know who The One is: our Lord and

233
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.050
Savior, he is the One. Hallelujah.

247
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:26.440
Announcements, announcements, announcements. You can have a seat. Buckle up, there are a few of them.

248

250
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:48.920
hot chocolate to our neighbors. We want to know our neighbors and we want our neighbors to know us,

251
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:54.510
we forget sometimes people are longing for community and we are so blessed to have this one. So

252
00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:00.360

265
00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:30.900

266
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.980
to watch a quick video as we dismiss the Children to the annex.

267
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:15.330
Hey, we're in this series called Joyful expectations and today we're gonna be looking at a passage

268
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:21.890
that is found in luke chapter one and it's a story of Zachariah and Elizabeth and I know you've

269
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:31.040
heard most likely some part of this story, but today we're gonna focus on an aspect of it that maybe

270
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:39.920
just maybe it might be new for you today, I believe every time we revisit the scriptures and even

271
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.850
revisit stories that we think we know God has something new to show us and so I pray that our minds

272
00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:52.510
and hearts would be open, as we would read in luke chapter one beginning at verse 18 and it said

273
00:55:52.510 --> 00:56:01.900
that Zachariah said to the Angel that had appeared to him, how can I be sure this will happen?

274
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:09.840
Zachariah is looking for confirmation. He's looking for affirmation. He's looking for more evidence.

275
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:18.590
He wants more proof so that he can put his faith in what the angel is saying and he's saying, how

276
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:25.770
can I be sure this will happen? I am an old man now and now he's going into his reasons and then he

277
00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:31.770
says, And my wife is also well along in years. I like the way he said that you could tell Zachary

278
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:39.840
has been married a long time. He said he was the old one. And then said, his wife is just, you know,

279
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:48.880
advanced in her years as well. And then the angel said, I am Gabriel. I stand in the very presence

280
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:59.770
of God. And so what we have here is an archangel. And and Gabriel is coming with an authority that

281
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:07.630
is even higher than any that the other angels may possess. He has gone directly into the presence of

282
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:13.480
God. And now he finds himself before. Zachariah. And that's important for us to to know this because

283
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:25.310
it tells us that angels are not just emissaries or messengers, but that they are essential in seeing

284
00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:35.390
the plans of God fulfilled. And God wants to see his plans fulfilled, not through his angels, but

285
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:40.370
through his people who have made a decision to follow him.

286
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:52.990
And so Gabriel is bringing the message, but the ones who are to fulfill the plan, are Zachariah and

287
00:57:52.990 --> 00:58:04.280
Elizabeth. I want you to understand how important you are to God and how essential you are to his

288
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:12.490
plan and how that plan cannot be fulfilled unless we are willing

289
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:26.320
to come into the presence of God and say, when you speak to me, I will not doubt you. I will follow

290
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.880
you with the faith that I have.

291
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:43.830
And so the story continues and it says it was he who sent me to bring you this good news. But now,

292
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:51.020
since you didn't believe what I said, you will be silent

293
00:58:53.090 --> 00:59:06.130
and unable to speak until the child is born, for my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper

294
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:14.510
time. And meanwhile the people were waiting for Zachariah to come out of the sanctuary because he

295
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:22.580
was in the temple doing his service unto God. And they were all wondering why he was taking so long.

296
00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:29.740
And in those days, they would sometimes fear that if the priest had not taken proper care of his

297
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:39.070
spiritual life, that he may not come out of the temple at all and they would have to drag his body

298
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:48.000
out with the rope that they had tied around his waist. And so the people were waiting. And then

299
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:59.050
finally, when he comes out in verse 22, he couldn't speak to them. They realized from his gestures

300
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.550
and his silence, that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary. And so they imagine that what has

301
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:14.460
happened is that he's just overwhelmed and overpowered by the presence of God and that he has only

302
01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:23.460
temporarily lost his ability to speak. But they don't know that he had an encounter with an angel

303
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:31.850
who took away his ability to speak. That the angel silenced him

304
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:42.560
and that he cannot speak until the child is born. And Zacharias week of service in the temple was

305
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:53.130
over, he returned home And soon afterward his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and went into seclusion

306
01:00:53.130 --> 01:01:03.120
for five months. How kind the Lord is? She explained, he has taken away my disgrace the shame of not

307
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.280
having any Children.

308
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:19.670
And the story would continue that once Elizabeth gave birth to their son, they would name him john

309
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:27.610
and he would become known as john the baptist, you're familiar with that name, John was that son.

310
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:36.580
And the moment that they were discussing and talking about what name he should have and because they

311
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:46.140
had not heard Zachariah speak throughout the pregnancy. All of a sudden he now utters the words his

312
01:01:46.140 --> 01:02:01.030
name shall be john and the silence is broken And for the first time in 400 years, Israel has a

313
01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:11.620
profit. Once again, someone who is going to announce the coming of the Messiah, who is Jesus, our

314
01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:22.760
Lord. And I want you to imagine that Zachariah advanced in age, not having had the family that he

315
01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:29.380
envisioned, he would have in the servants of God must have lived with quite a number of

316
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:35.350
disappointments like all of us in one way or another to the point where through circumstances and

317
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:42.830
challenges through disaster and disappointment, we have just gotten to the point where it's

318
01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:51.330
difficult for us to be joyful enough can happen in our lives, that we can just lose sight of what it

319
01:02:51.330 --> 01:03:03.320
is to be joyful and to expect that God can still do something that can bring us joy in our lives.

320
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:10.820
And I think Zachariah was just past that point, you know, just past that moment in his life where he

321
01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:18.540
just recognized that he just was gonna do his service honor. God live out the last days of his

322
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:24.060
service in the temple and then you know, his life would be done. But God said, no, you don't

323
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:32.900
understand Zachariah, you may not have any expectations for your life. You may look at your life and

324
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:41.160
not feel like there's anything joyful to look forward to, but I'm gonna give it to you right now and

325
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:50.030
he gives it to him and he tells him you're gonna be a father, your wife is going to be a mother, I

326
01:03:50.030 --> 01:04:01.370
am going to give you a profit in the land, it's gonna come from you, your household and Zachariah

327
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:14.260
who was advanced in age And we saw that he described himself as just old. I hear people say that

328
01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.720
they feel old when they're in their 30s.

329
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:25.240
I hear that my daughter is always complaining that I've given her bad genetics because she's got a

330
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:34.160
pain in her knee now. She's only 19. It says dad, you gave me bad genes, that that knee that you

331
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:40.590
hurt with. I've got it. I'm starting to feel old like you,

332
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:52.430
sometimes we're young, but we feel old. I heard someone describe their child just the other day that

333
01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.840
they were an old soul. Have you ever heard that expression? They were just like serious. You know,

334
01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.120
like I didn't laugh like the other kids, they didn't play like the other kids just like more

335
01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.290
intellectual, just more reserved, just just carry themselves differently. You know, wouldn't get on

336
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:13.550
the ground like the other Children. And just an old soul listen to old music. You know, like not

337
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:24.800
that they didn't understand music, but just an old soul. I think that sometimes we just get old in

338
01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:32.260
our relationship with God and we realize that that were just kind of just living our life and going

339
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:43.410
through the motions and we lose our joyful expectation of what God can bring even now. Still,

340
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:55.970
I hate that Zachariah has to be silenced. But I I honestly believe that God had to silence Zachariah

341
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.990
so his doubts wouldn't become contagious.

342
01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:10.090
And I feel like sometimes around people and they're just going through a hard time and I get it and

343
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:15.720
we have to listen to those people, we have to help them get out of it. You know, there's a season

344
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:23.780
for us to grieve, there's a season for us to grieve with them, but we can't allow people to remain

345
01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:30.690
in that season of grief forever. Does that make sense? You know, there was a prophet in the Bible by

346
01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:36.280
the name of Jeremiah and and the Bible says that he was a great profit, but but he was always a

347
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:42.310
little down and he was always a little depressed. This guy, you had, you had you had problems that

348
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:48.330
way, you just did. And when you read through Jeremiah, it makes you sad and it makes total sense

349
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:54.000
that the next book he would write is actually called lamentations. Does that make sense? And the

350
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.870
thing about Jeremiah is that he was always like, you know, just looking at the thing from the wrong

351
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:04.100
side of things like just the wrong way had the wrong attitude often and and when when he, when he

352
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:11.070
cries out to God in the book of lamentations, we need to understand that that lamenting before God

353
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:17.730
is just it's just it's okay, it's even okay to be angry before God, you know that it's okay to be

354
01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:26.470
upset with him, but here's what lament is lament is an in between place between pain and praise

355
01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:36.750
and if you stay in that place of lament too long, you never get to the place of praise.

356
01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:45.240
We understand that pain brought you to question. God brought you to question yourself, brought you

357
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.790
to question other people, got you to question everything that happened to you and the things that

358
01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:57.450
were done to you and you are in that place of lament. But if you live there, you never get to

359
01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:07.060
experience the praise and what God is telling all of us is that we can be silenced to the point

360
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:18.990
where we don't get to praise. If we stay in this place of doubt and disappointment too long. God

361
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:24.710
wants to move us out of that place into a place where we have joyful expectations again

362
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:35.390
and you know, he gets silenced, he gets silenced because God doesn't want his doubts to be passed on

363
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:47.120
to his wife. There's no way, Zachariah, that you are leaving my presence and going to your wife

364
01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:57.650
and spreading this garbage. Because I have given you my word that your wife will bear a son and his

365
01:08:57.650 --> 01:09:03.090
name is to be john, can we say amen to that. You know, there are times where God has to silence us

366
01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:08.860
because we are doing no good in the world. Honestly, he doesn't want us to be silenced. But he has

367
01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:14.520
to silence us because instead of making things better, we're making them worse. And I don't want us

368
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.580
to be silenced. God doesn't want anyone here to be silenced what he wants is for us to be able to

369
01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:28.590
shout his promise, come on, Gabriel came out of the presence of God when right to Zachariah and gave

370
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:35.010
him an opportunity to come out of that temple shouting that he was going to be a father, that his

371
01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:40.540
wife was gonna bear him a son. Instead they went into hiding for five months. Do you understand

372
01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:48.930
what's happening in the story? Because he couldn't speak and it was for him to say it. They had to

373
01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:57.290
go into hiding. Elizabeth couldn't be out in public pregnant because they knew that everyone be like,

374
01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.050
I wonder who the father is.

375
01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:13.550
And so they went into hiding and this is what happens. This is what happens when we allow our doubt

376
01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:21.630
and our fears and our disappointments and our discouragement and whatever devastation we've gone

377
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:30.240
through and whatever it is that we no longer believe can bring us to a place of joy in our present

378
01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:37.610
lives. This is what happens. We get silenced and God says, I don't want to silence you. I want to

379
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:46.490
make you a part of this. I want you to be out there receiving from me having joyful expectations of

380
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:55.780
the future. Look, some of us have just been waiting and and and expecting absolutely nothing

381
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:08.000
content. Maybe even satisfied. Listen, sit in a dark room long enough and you realize that you stop

382
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.870
needing light.

383
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:25.070
But darkness can never substitute the light that God wants to give you. No matter how comfortable

384
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:27.010
you get living in it.

385
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.540
If you think that what you've received so far is good enough. I want you to know right now. You are

386
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:42.340
so wrong because God is the kind of God who only brings us from one place to the next, from one

387
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:49.460
level to the next. From one experience to the next. From great to greater. That's who he is. That's

388
01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:58.160
what he does. And so if you don't go into your life expecting that, even after hardships, even after

389
01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:06.730
things have been taken from you, things that in some ways you will never get back, just like the

390
01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:16.550
last two days spending time with this RCMP officers family never get there's dad back. They'll never

391
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:25.450
get their husband back. It's been taken from them at the age of 43 gone,

392
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.890
but eternal.

393
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.140
I need you to understand that.

394
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:51.110
Can they dare to expect joy enjoy in their future? The answer is yes and it is yes for you as well.

395
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:58.090
She doesn't matter what you've been through. But it's the fact that to this very moment, to this

396
01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:03.140
very day, God continues to send his angels to minister to you

397
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:13.310
and he brings people into your life to encourage you and to show you this is the path. Stop going

398
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:20.350
back to the disappointment. Stop going back to the silence. You were not to be silent anymore. You

399
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:27.890
are to speak. The promise of God. The promise of God that is on your life. The promise of God that

400
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:36.100
is for your future. The Promise of God, that you need to shout. When they heard Zacharias speak,

401
01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:43.200
they were all amazed. They thought he had lost his his voice forever. But he was only silenced until

402
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:50.640
the promise was fulfilled. And here's what I need you to understand. Silence didn't nullify the

403
01:13:50.640 --> 01:14:00.100
promise of God. The promise of God just kept going. It kept growing within Elizabeth. And when the

404
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:08.670
time came for the promise to be fulfilled, well, Zachariah was able to speak again and so will you.

405
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:21.630
Your voice is not lost. It hasn't been taken from you because the promise of God cannot be nullified

406
01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:34.270
in your life. Sometimes we participate in satan's plan and allowing ourselves to be silenced. And we

407
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:40.070
walk away from God and walk away from serving him and walk away from our purpose. And and we walk

408
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:46.250
away from his plan and we walk away from his promises. And we think they're no longer there for us.

409
01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:51.540
And that's exactly what he wants. He wants us to stay in the silence. But what happened in the

410
01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:58.390
silence for Zachariah is that he kept looking forward to the day when he would once again be able to

411
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:04.400
speak. Can you say amen to that? He knew the day was coming because he knew that his son would

412
01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.900
one day be born. And when his son was finally born, he knew that he would once again be able to

413
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.720
speak. And maybe he didn't know 100%, maybe he wasn't sure. And maybe there were days where he was

414
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:23.680
certain in days where he wasn't and days when he knew that he had messed up and he felt so bad and

415
01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:31.210
unworthy and and shamed of that, I'm sure of it. And then there were days when he would look at his

416
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:38.280
wife and he couldn't believe that that the next prophet of their nation of the world was there, who

417
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.950
was going to announce the Messiah to come. He would look at that and say, my whole life has been

418
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:52.850
worth it. Because right now, even though I've been silenced, my son is going to speak the promises

419
01:15:52.850 --> 01:16:01.550
of God and sometimes we look to the future and we looked at what the next generation can do. But it

420
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:09.960
doesn't mean that we, in our generation will not have an opportunity to also speak and Zachariah was

421
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:17.770
able to speak and to say his name shall be john and God fulfilled his plan and his purpose and his

422
01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:26.920
promise in his life and God is going to do the same for you. What is it that you no longer dare to

423
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:33.900
dream? No longer dare to hope for? What is it that you've given up on, because you feel like you've

424
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:42.910
been silenced. What is it that you can't joyfully expect to come in your life? I want you to know

425
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:47.200
that that is not God's plan for your life, That is not what God wants for your life. That is not

426
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:52.870
what you are supposed to live in your life. What you are supposed to live in your life is joyful

427
01:16:52.870 --> 01:17:02.080
expectation, an expectation that God has much more to give you to do in you and even through you and

428
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:09.860
he did it in this story and he can do it in your story as well. God bless you, thank you so much,

429
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.810
afraid that that encourages you

430
01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:20.060
and would you stand as we wrap this up and the band's gonna come back for a great song. It's called

431
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:28.220
Christmas day and I can't believe that we're that close to it and I'm excited to just celebrate once

432
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:35.140
again and what this time of the year means. And for sure we're not really celebrating Christmas at

433
01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:41.300
the time in which it was described in the scriptures, but you know, that's not what matters. What

434
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:48.170
matters is that we celebrate his birth and that we take the time to honor God and that we take the

435
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:56.710
time to be joyful of what to expect. And if and if God could bless us with Jesus, hey, we've got

436
01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:03.350
everything everything that we need to keep being blessed in our lives as long as we keep honoring

437
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:09.490
Jesus and having joyful expectations in our life. And so father, we want to pray your blessing over

438
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:15.250
each and every person that is here and the hundreds that watch online and we just thank you God that

439
01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:21.520
you are just growing this community of faith and that you are giving us an opportunity to do this so

440
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:28.940
beautifully in the city that you have called us to. You want to pray for other churches that are

441
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:37.660
gathering that we pray for how they are spreading your light and your word and how they are called

442
01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:46.810
to do this in another place and that we all have the same purpose and that is to, to make you known.

443
01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:53.540
Thank you for the people that were baptized today and for the ones that you just touched in the

444
01:18:53.540 --> 01:19:00.450
service and and talked to about taking that step themselves one day and I want to thank you God that

445
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:09.230
we may have felt silence coming in but we are leaving this place shouting, shouting your promises

446
01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:17.220
God no longer to be silenced but filled with joyful expectation of what you have next and we pray

447
01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:25.760
this together in Jesus name, Amen, Amen, God bless you guys thank you so much. Let's sing this song

448
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.360
together and I'll see you guys at the after party.

452
01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:58.750

453
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:05.540
