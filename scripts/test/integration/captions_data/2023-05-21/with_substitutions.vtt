00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.269
Love you. So whether you're online or in person, like we're just so glad you're here. Um And I

2
00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:33.029
believe that you're gonna get what you need today um from the Lord. And our worship is amazing. I

3
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.440
heard it on Thursday during the practice and the spirit was so present. So we're gonna have an

4
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.829
amazing time of worship. And then also pastor is gonna come out and give us a word. It's always

5
00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:49.290
timely, especially for me, like every time I'm always taking a million notes. So I know that Holy

6
00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:54.410
Spirit is just gonna bless you. He's gonna speak to you. Um He loves you. So whatever you came in

7
00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.059
for you're gonna receive. So let's go ahead and stand to our feet and just welcome the River's Edge

8
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:06.049
worship team and just posture our hearts in a place of surrender and just being able to receive and

9
00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:13.019
uh and praise him. OK? We're gonna start with this beautiful older song, a vintage song called

10
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:20.049
Cornerstone. And Jesus is called the Cornerstone. That is the piece that is put in the building that

11
00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:27.739
has the support and he provides the strength and the durability that we need so that we can overcome

12
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:35.190
all the storms that happen in our life. So let us praise the Lord and think about the cornerstone as

13
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.500
that important piece that Jesus is in our life. Let's sing this song.

14
00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:07.659
I think my hope is built, my hope. Um

15
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.409
Then Jesus righteous

16
00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:18.729
and

17
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.409
the sweetest friend,

18
00:09:24.849 --> 00:09:35.309
but holy trust in you Jesus name. Let's sing. Verse one again. My hope is built on nothing less, my

19
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.950
hope on nothing. Then Jesus has gone

20
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.099
to

21
00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:52.080
in 19. The sweetest

22
00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:58.820
the dress Jesus' name

23
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.650
Id on car.

24
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.309
We make in the sand. Thank you.

25
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.280
No.

26
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.289
When darkness to highest

27
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.010
unchanging

28
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.659
with this

29
00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:06.679
cry

30
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:16.179
in the

31
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.640
we,

32
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.820

33
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:24.979

34
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.669
Dress is wrong. Just is

35
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:46.950
faultless and before it, oh, let's see. Christ alone. Christ. God call,

is a hello.

38
00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:22.640
The next song we're gonna sing is called Believe for it. And today the message that we're going to

39
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:33.369
be hearing is about a message of hope. God. He is the way when there seems to be no way we trust in

40
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.700
Him because he will always have the final say. Amen. Let's sing this song together.

41
00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:54.950
They say this mountain can be.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:13.750
They say these chains will never rain but they don't know you like we do serious. Are in your,

115
00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:55.369
and then we're gonna get into the words. So I won't keep you too long. But um first things, first,

116
00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.609
we have a women's ministry that we're just starting to create. It's amazing. Patricia over there is

118
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:12.709

119
00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:18.500

120
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:23.859
and you want to join, you wanna um just get filled up, uh make sure to see her in the back. So go to

121
00:24:23.869 --> 00:24:29.069

122
00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:35.099
June 17th on a Saturday and then next is kids worship. So we're actually super excited because we

123
00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:40.420
are growing a worship ministry for the kids. So we're gonna be helping lead them into worship and

124
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:45.800
rotating them. Um But we're actually, yeah, we're rotating some, some musicians and singers to

125
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:51.680
actually lead them, which is exciting and then also youth ministry. So in two weeks, the youth is

126
00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:57.319
gonna meet at 10 AM before the gathering begins. So that's in two weeks. Um So if you're interested,

127
00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:01.869
see Talita in the back, she's gonna go ahead and be the person that you wanna contact. She's in the

128
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.469
jacket right now looking fabulous. Um So yeah, so we're excited, we're gonna be doing a new

129
00:25:06.479 --> 00:25:14.170
experience for the youth. Um And it's gonna be great to see where that goes. So also the tech team

130
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:20.699
is looking for people to join. Uh we love the tech team so much like we love them. They are

131
00:25:20.709 --> 00:25:26.550
incredible and they're all just amazing humans and you don't need experience to join like I'm just

132
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:33.089
shouting you guys out in the back and the live like we love you so much. Um Yeah, so just, you don't

133
00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:39.000
see their faces often because they're running everything from the ground up in the back end, making

134
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.510
this happen. Um And they need more people, they need more help and you really don't need experience

135
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:50.209
in tech. I've done it before and I was like feeling super nervous and overwhelmed and when I came in

136
00:25:50.219 --> 00:25:55.290
it was like Josiah and, and everyone back there even Louis and all these people, like they're just

137
00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.430
so encouraging and Sam and uh and they just, they give you all the tools so you're not gonna be in

138
00:26:00.439 --> 00:26:05.489
there unequipped or ill equipped, don't know the word but you will have everything you need. Um And

139
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.290
it's just a great way to serve, especially if you're nervous about talking to people or you're not

140
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.540
sure you want to interact yet. It's nice because you're in the back and you don't have to if you

141
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:19.599
don't want to. So um So, yeah, the tech team is amazing. And uh if something is like stirring inside

142
00:26:19.609 --> 00:26:26.420
of you, go ahead and talk to us because um we want to get you started and get you equipped. Um And

143
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:33.729
then also we have a community kitchen brunch coming up on May 28th. So community kitchen is just the

144
00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:40.689
best. It's so great because Jesus welcomes us to his banquet table. He always has a place for us at

145
00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:45.119
the table. And so we kind of, we model that we want to break bread together. We want to be in

146
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:50.050
community together like this is the church, this is community and I love how we make space for that

147
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:55.839
at the church. So you don't have to go very far, you just stay after. Um So yeah, so that's the 28th.

148
00:26:55.849 --> 00:27:01.000
Bring yourself after the gathering. Don't run out. We're gonna eat food together and uh connect

149
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:07.060
together. So, and then lastly, the giving, I just wanna say, you know, there's four ways to give, we

150
00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:12.219
love you every amount no matter how small or large like it matters. And it's, it doesn't go

151
00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:17.560
unnoticed by Jesus or your community. It's just you're sowing into something and you're so faithful.

152
00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:22.339
So I just wanna um you know, highlight the four ways that you can do that. Um And then I was just

153
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:28.589
told about 20 minutes ago that um we wanna make sure and remember if you're giving money uh to um

154
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:33.819
use your envelopes, we just need your information if we want to give you a tax receipt and send that

155
00:27:33.829 --> 00:27:38.349
back. So if we don't have your name and your address or you're just popping cash in there or you

156
00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:42.189
know, using the machine, but we don't have it in an envelope. We're not gonna be able to actually um

157
00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:46.800
give you that receipt. So just make sure you use an envelope, give your in your details. I don't

158
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:51.689
remember the full extent of it, of the information for that. But hopefully at some point, someone

159
00:27:51.699 --> 00:27:56.369
will say that again or you can ask someone on team afterwards like Bryan, he's right there. He's

160
00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:02.839
waving, he's awesome. So uh yeah, so that's it. I'm gonna go ahead and let Pastor Zo come out now.

161
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:07.160
Let's just posture our hearts to receive from the Lord. And welcome Pastor Zo.

162
00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:15.500
Thanks Kristina.

163
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:29.739
Nice. So good to be with you today as we continue with this uh series that we're in called peace and

164
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:37.829
unlocking new levels of peace. And there's so much that we can learn about how we can have peace

165
00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:44.189
regardless of the circumstances that we're in. And one of the beautiful things about the Lord is

166
00:28:44.199 --> 00:28:50.150
that he comes with his peace. I know a lot of us when we ask the Lord to intervene in our lives,

167
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:58.630
we're asking him for very specific blessings. And I think we kind of underestimate the blessing of

168
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:07.790
peace and we don't recognize how important it is to truly enjoying everything that he is making

169
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:14.979
available to us as a blessing in this life. And there's so much that can disrupt our peace. There's

170
00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:22.219
so much that can challenge it. There's so much that can happen to derail us from living a life of

171
00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:31.089
peace. It's so fragile, it's difficult to hold on to. And there are so many things that can just

172
00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:37.890
affect us. And sometimes when our piece is affected, it's not just affected in the moment, it can be

173
00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:45.339
affecting us for, for hours, sometimes days and longer than that. And we don't realize, but it can

174
00:29:45.349 --> 00:29:53.140
then become a pattern in our lives of how we just respond to when things are affecting our peace.

175
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:58.969
And so what we've been doing is that we've been looking at ways of how we through the scriptures and

176
00:29:58.979 --> 00:30:07.060
through the wisdom of God can hold on to that peace and actually attain new levels of peace. And

177
00:30:07.069 --> 00:30:13.810
today, I want to speak to you about how we can experience peace of mind, but through hope. And as we

178
00:30:13.819 --> 00:30:22.209
speak on the topic of hope, there's some things that maybe we have just stopped hoping for. And I

179
00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:28.489
think that when we do that, we, we may have just just come to terms with the fact that things are

180
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:35.579
just not going to be the way that we envisioned them to be. And we imagine that because of the stage

181
00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:42.170
of life that we're in the decisions that we've made, the things that have happened to us, the things

182
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:50.489
that have been done to us that we've just made a decision that we were going to just stop hoping for

183
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.310
these things. I, I, I don't know what that may be in your heart, but I believe that all of us in one

184
00:30:56.319 --> 00:31:03.579
way or another have stopped hoping for something. I know that to be true because I believe the

185
00:31:03.589 --> 00:31:10.150
scriptures speak to the topic of hope because He knows that we are a people who can easily stop

186
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:19.300
hoping and that we can make decisions to stop trusting God in areas of our life where we feel that

187
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:26.959
it's too late for us to experience the very things that we had hoped for. And it's just too painful

188
00:31:26.969 --> 00:31:35.310
to relive it. So we stop hoping it's too hurtful to go back there. So we just decide that we are not

189
00:31:35.319 --> 00:31:41.920
going to hope. And interestingly enough, there's a prophet in the scriptures and his name is

190
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:48.800
Jeremiah. And Jeremiah is considered a major prophet, not because the others were minor, but because

191
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:57.810
his book is longer than everybody else's. So Jeremiah has a lot to say and uh and it was recorded in

192
00:31:57.819 --> 00:32:04.469
the scriptures as something that was especially meaningful to the people that needed to hear his

193
00:32:04.479 --> 00:32:14.400
message. And, and the message of Jeremiah is one that continues into the book of lamentations and to

194
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:21.119
lament. Something is really to grieve something. It's to mourn something. And Jeremiah is considered

195
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:30.760
to be a sad prophet, a grieving prophet because of the fact that he has a lot to grieve over in his

196
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:38.770
life. He hasn't had it easy and the events in which he's been asked to speak to his people haven't

197
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:45.949
been easy at all. He finds himself in a time and in a season where his people have experienced great

198
00:32:45.959 --> 00:32:53.329
losses. And Jeremiah is someone who in the story that we're looking at is someone who is having to

199
00:32:53.339 --> 00:32:59.619
deal with the fact that the Babylonian Empire has come and has destroyed the temple. It has taken

200
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:08.650
the lives of his loved ones, his family, his friends, his people, they have not only been taken into

201
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:15.260
captivity but the ones that have been left behind or people who are suffering greatly, they're under

202
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:22.829
heavy tribute and they're not able to rebuild their walls or rebuild their temple. And so their

203
00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:32.640
worship has come to an end in the way that they need to experience it to feel close to God. And so

204
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:40.650
the events of their life collectively has been utterly destroyed and decimated. It's no longer the

205
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:49.310
same. And so they find themselves with a lack of hope. And so I want us to read some of that in

206
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:57.189
lamentations chapter three. And I've kind of divided it into three sections at first um for us then

207
00:33:57.199 --> 00:34:02.640
to go to 1/4 section that speaks to the hope. But I think it's important for us to just to hear the

208
00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:09.939
tone of what Jeremiah is going through and sometimes when we listen to someone say they're good,

209
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:17.929
they're fine. Everything's ok. You, you can kind of sense that it isn't. And even when someone is

210
00:34:17.939 --> 00:34:23.370
trying to be positive, you can tell that they're just more negative than they are positive. You can

211
00:34:23.379 --> 00:34:31.709
tell that they're more just devastated by the outlook of the future. Then they are encouraged by it.

212
00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:37.629
And, and, and as we read this, you're gonna, you're gonna sense that automatically. And so in

213
00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:44.179
lamentations three and in verse one and two, it says, I am the one who has seen the afflictions that

214
00:34:44.189 --> 00:34:47.120
come from the rod of the Lord's anger.

215
00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:59.090
And he has led me into darkness and he is shutting out all the light. He has besieged and he has

216
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:07.080
surrounded me with anguish and distress. He has buried me in a dark place like those that are long

217
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:16.280
dead. He has walled me in and I cannot escape. He has bound me in heavy chains. And though I cry and

218
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:24.280
shout, he has shut out my prayers. A peace has been stripped away and I have forgotten what

219
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:37.540
prosperity is. I cry out, my splendor is gone. Everything I had hoped for from the Lord is lost and

220
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:45.629
the thought of my suffering and homelessness is bitter beyond words. I will never forget this awful

221
00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:55.340
time as I grieve over my loss. Can you resonate a little bit with these words? Is there a moment in

222
00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:01.389
your life where this just speaks very powerfully to what you have gone through or to maybe what

223
00:36:01.399 --> 00:36:02.540
you're going through right now?

224
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:12.699
Well, don't lose hope because in the story that we're in what the prophet Jeremiah reveals is that

225
00:36:12.709 --> 00:36:18.850
he battled inner darkness and depression. And I want us to understand that depression comes when we

226
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.850
lose hope.

227
00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.949
When we believe that things cannot turn around, when things cannot change, when things cannot be

228
00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:34.459
better than they are. It is then that we slip into depression. Depression comes because we have lost

229
00:36:34.469 --> 00:36:40.449
hope. And so we have to then identify the area in which we have lost hope to identify the area of

230
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:49.979
why the place in our lives, why we are depressed? It's directly connected, they're linked there one

231
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:56.379
and the same. But we don't always see it like that because we don't always understand that the

232
00:36:56.389 --> 00:37:01.070
greatest remedy to overcoming depression is actually hope.

233
00:37:03.209 --> 00:37:09.669
It's more powerful than any medication anyone can ever offer or take is better than any therapy

234
00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:15.449
session you could ever be in. It's better than any friend, heart to heart conversation. You could

235
00:37:15.459 --> 00:37:21.419
have it's better than any kind of community that you could be a part of or something that would

236
00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:28.439
maybe distract you through a hobby or an activity, something that you could throw yourself

237
00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:37.659
completely in which sometimes people do with their work and sometimes they do that with their

238
00:37:37.669 --> 00:37:38.179
pleasure.

239
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:52.120
You see, there are symptoms all around, speaking to us of where we've lost hope, but we would rather

240
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:59.929
keep numbing ourselves than doing what is required to restoring that hope.

241
00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:08.979
And I know that it's not simple. It's not easy. It isn't something that is going to require, you

242
00:38:08.989 --> 00:38:15.879
know, a measure of dedication and perseverance on our behalf. But it is what we will need to do.

243
00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:25.500
Lamentations is comprised of five poems. They are chapters and, and what they do is that they form

244
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:29.979
the laments for Judah and Jerusalem when they were invaded and devastated.

245
00:38:32.709 --> 00:38:41.219
But the sufferings of the population aren't everything that Jeremiah is lamenting. It's, it's also

246
00:38:41.229 --> 00:38:46.120
the fact that this happened in the first place and the reason it happens in the first place is

247
00:38:46.129 --> 00:38:54.699
because God allows bad things to happen when we are disobedient in our relationship with Him.

248
00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:07.139
When we don't honor God. There are times where God has to bring us back to our senses and back to a

249
00:39:07.149 --> 00:39:13.350
place where we can honor him again. And the only way that we are going to do that as if everything

250
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:23.959
falls apart and he allows things to fall apart so that he can put them back together in a way that

251
00:39:23.969 --> 00:39:25.459
they will never fall apart again.

252
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.419
His heart isn't for things to fall apart. His heart is to restore. But sometimes if things don't

253
00:39:33.429 --> 00:39:40.879
fall apart. We don't look for God and we don't look for understanding in the devastation and we

254
00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:49.639
don't break free from the depression and God's remedy for all these things is actually hope. And I

255
00:39:49.649 --> 00:39:57.550
want you to see that today is a day in which we can have hope in the book of Proverbs in chapter 12

256
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:05.860
and verse 25. It's a beautiful verse and it just says this anxiety in the heart of man causes

257
00:40:06.129 --> 00:40:11.310
depression, but a good word makes it black.

258
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:20.350
And so we can see how we can just get to a place where we just don't believe that things are going

259
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:27.590
to get better. We're anxious, we're worried were led to a place of depression. But the scripture

260
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:38.830
said that a good word. A good word can make our hearts glad. Again. It's saying that hope can

261
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:48.649
reignite our hearts to believe in a way that they never could. God is saying, I want to be that good

262
00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:57.760
word in your life. I want to be the one who brings that good word. I want to be the one who shows

263
00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:06.770
you that depression isn't just sadness, it's not just discouragement, but it's constant darkness.

264
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:15.030
It's the absence of motivation, it's happening because you have lost all hope. And what I want to do

265
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:22.250
is I want to come back into your life and I want to reignite that hope by giving you a word for you

266
00:41:23.129 --> 00:41:30.419
a word for your life, a word for your situation. A word for your circumstances. A word for what you

267
00:41:30.429 --> 00:41:38.360
have been living and going through a word for everything that you have somehow stopped believing

268
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:45.939
could be possible again in your life. And so God wants to give you a word

269
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:56.260
and there have been many times in my life where God had to give me a word because I too was

270
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:05.300
discouraged. I too was in darkness and I too have lived what it's like to be in depression. You see,

271
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:11.139
it doesn't just come to prophets like Jeremiah who have to write books like lamentations. It comes

272
00:42:11.149 --> 00:42:17.479
to all of us. And this is not me speaking from a place like I have never experienced this. I'm

273
00:42:17.489 --> 00:42:22.879
speaking from a place where I have experienced it and I've experienced it for longer than I would

274
00:42:22.889 --> 00:42:28.360
have liked for longer than I would have wanted for much longer than I had hoped.

275
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:40.300
And so if you find yourself in this cyclical pattern of losing hope consistently, I ask you ask

276
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:50.639
yourself this question, where is it that I get a good word from? And and why is it that I don't hear

277
00:42:50.649 --> 00:42:57.159
a good word? Why is it that I cannot believe in a good word? Why is it that I cannot trust this good

278
00:42:57.169 --> 00:43:05.520
word for me? Why is it that I have somehow believed falsely that there is no good word for my life?

279
00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:09.520
I want you to ask yourself this question right now, God,

280
00:43:12.629 --> 00:43:16.270
what is your word for me?

281
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:27.790
What is your good word for me? Can you do that right now? Just in your mind and in your heart, God,

282
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:37.370
what is your good word for me? Help me to know it so I can snap out of this condition that I'm in

283
00:43:37.379 --> 00:43:45.300
and move forward in the power of your hope. So what I can see this anxiety and sadness and

284
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:56.699
discouragement dispelled once and for all, and I can see it destroyed and this hope in me reignited,

285
00:43:56.709 --> 00:44:08.370
moving me forward in the power that you give with your presence. See, when God gives you a word, he

286
00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:17.580
comes with this power behind that word and I need clarity in my life just like you do. There are

287
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.379
moments where I'm confused where I'm distraught where I'm just troubled in my spirit. I don't know

288
00:44:22.389 --> 00:44:28.050
which way to go. I don't know the decision to make. Sometimes we're like that when we're in a

289
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:33.389
relationship, we've caught feelings, we, we love someone and we know that they're not the right

290
00:44:33.399 --> 00:44:40.459
person for us, but yet we still persist and we pursue and we continue to try to power through in the

291
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:45.850
relationship, even though God in that moment, what we should be praying for is God give me a word.

292
00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:54.340
Sometimes it's because we want to give up and God is saying no, no. If you just hold on a little

293
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:59.830
longer, you could see that things can actually turn around and I want to give you a word that tells

294
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.889
you to stay faithful and tells you to keep trying and not give up. Let God give you the word that

295
00:45:06.899 --> 00:45:14.620
you need for the season of life that you're in. Trust Him for that. Try to fix it on your own all

296
00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:19.379
the time. You see God is saying, I want to come into your life. I want to lift this anxiety. I want

297
00:45:19.389 --> 00:45:24.419
to take away the depression. I want to do this by giving you a word.

298
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:33.620
I, I, I don't know if you hear from God, I don't know if you've ever heard from Him. My insight on

299
00:45:33.629 --> 00:45:41.949
this is that God has been speaking to you your whole life. My insight into this is that He is your

300
00:45:41.959 --> 00:45:50.290
shepherd and you as his sheep, you know his voice. My insight into this is that is that when we are

301
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:57.330
his sheep, we not only hear the voice, but we know it's the one that we should follow

302
00:46:00.879 --> 00:46:05.939
and, and what God is trying to help you to get to in a place in your life and in your relationship

303
00:46:05.949 --> 00:46:11.129
with Him is that when you hear that voice, you know, it, it's, it's a, it's a voice that stands

304
00:46:11.139 --> 00:46:16.709
apart. It is a voice that is filled with power and anointing that, you know, it is different than

305
00:46:16.719 --> 00:46:22.040
any other voice you've ever heard in your life. It is not the voice that you're familiar with in

306
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:29.800
your head. It isn't the voice that you're familiar with outside of your existence. It's not that

307
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:36.590
voice that you have sometimes battled with, that is just seeped in darkness. It is the voice of the

308
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.239
shepherd.

309
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.199
And, and what Jesus wants to do is he wants to come into your life and, and lead you and he wants to

310
00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:50.310
do it with a good word and he wants to lead you out of whatever it is that is holding you back from

311
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.330
experiencing his very best. He wants to give you that peace. But more importantly, he just wants to

312
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:03.189
offer you that protection. He wants to give you that power and he wants to without a doubt, give you

313
00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:07.370
a life of prosperity like you've never experienced before. Can we say amen to that?

314
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:18.379
That's, that's his heart. That's what the shepherd wants to do. He doesn't want to lose a single one

315
00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:27.110
of us and he has the power to watch over the 99 as he goes after the one. He's the only one who can

316
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:33.790
do both. We don't have to worry about the 99 we don't have to worry about the one because Jesus has

317
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:40.320
got it all covered and that means we're all included in that. And the times in when we're faithful,

318
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.870
he is with them and the times and when we're not, he's still with us.

319
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.270
And so I don't know, if you're living this anxiety, I don't know if you're living this worry in your

320
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:59.010
heart and it's leading you to a place of depression and sometimes it's so insidious that it just

321
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:05.270
happens so gradually you don't even realize that you're headed there. You know, it just starts off

322
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.530
sometimes with just a little bit of negative thinking and a little negative talk, it starts in the,

323
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.260
in the form of gossip sometimes and just in the form of, of just dissatisfaction and we don't even

324
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:21.879
realize, but we're taking steps towards depression. We're taking steps to a place where hope doesn't

325
00:48:21.889 --> 00:48:28.260
live. You know, there's something powerful about Jesus and his teachings and the parables and one of

326
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:33.830
the things that he says about seeds and sowing them is that there's never a problem with the seed.

327
00:48:33.899 --> 00:48:35.780
There's always a problem with the ground.

328
00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:44.939
And what he's telling us is that is that his good word is always a seed but, but it needs to find

329
00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:49.860
good ground. And so I need you to be that good ground today. I need you to say I want to be that

330
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:58.330
good ground so that your good word finds good ground in my heart so that I can stop being a person

331
00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:04.010
who doesn't have hope. But instead I want to bring hope not just to myself but to the world around

332
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.300
me.

333
00:49:06.959 --> 00:49:15.719
See that can only happen if you make the decision to be good ground. I I, I didn't know I could make

334
00:49:15.729 --> 00:49:21.530
the decision to be good ground. You know, I just thought that you had good ground and that when you

335
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:26.790
had good ground, well, then the seed was going to produce a great harvest one night. But God is

336
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:32.850
saying, no, you don't understand. He says when I, when I speak my good word, I don't want it to fall

337
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:39.370
among the weeds and I don't want it to fall on the, on the road. I want it to fall in good ground

338
00:49:40.989 --> 00:49:45.439
because he wants us to make the decision to be good ground. You want to make that decision with me

339
00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:54.979
today. I want to be good ground so that your seed can grow so we can leave this garbage, depression

340
00:49:54.989 --> 00:49:57.959
behind and live a life of hope instead.

341
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:08.290
And God is saying, I want you to understand this because it's really key that you know, not just

342
00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:17.080
where does your good word come from, but I need you to know where does your hope come from? And it's

343
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:24.850
the same thing. And I want us to read this Psalm. It's Psalm 121. It's a short song,

344
00:50:27.959 --> 00:50:35.520
but it's a beautiful one because it says that when the people of God would go out on a pilgrimage

345
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:43.629
and they would head out to Jerusalem to experience God in the temple that this was a Psalm for those

346
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:50.479
who would ascend, for those who would ascend to the temple for those who would make the trek to be

347
00:50:50.489 --> 00:50:56.729
in the presence of God. And I feel like sometimes, um, you know, going into the presence of God is

348
00:50:56.739 --> 00:51:03.580
like the pilgrimage. It's like a long journey. It's, it's a challenging hike. It leaves us not only

349
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:09.389
tired but winded, but it's also a dangerous route to get there. Does anyone else feel like that

350
00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:15.770
sometimes? See in the season in which we're in, we can get so depressed and so exhausted by what

351
00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:20.719
we've been through that the last thing we wanna do is just, is leave our house or leave our couch

352
00:51:20.729 --> 00:51:29.250
and, and go looking for God. We don't want to be in a relationship with people, let alone be part of

353
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:36.300
a community of faith. You know, N D G might as well be some far and distant city in a different

354
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:43.149
country even though you might just live right around the corner when you're not doing well. That's

355
00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:50.989
what it feels like. And so when Psalm 1 21 does is that it speaks to us of how different it is when

356
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:59.030
you start to believe, not just where your good word comes from, but where your hope comes from. And

357
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:10.320
it says, I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where does my help come from? My help comes from the

358
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:22.780
Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip and he who watches over? You

359
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:34.300
will not slumber because indeed he who watches over Israel will never sleep, nor never sleep, never

360
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:42.010
slumber. I think it should have been the other way around. Personally, I'll just do my personal edit.

361
00:52:42.969 --> 00:52:52.780
Sorry about that. And the word tells us that the Lord watches over you, that the Lord is your shade

362
00:52:53.830 --> 00:53:02.179
at your right hand and the sun will not harm you by night, nor the moon. Sorry, the sun will not

363
00:53:02.189 --> 00:53:11.219
harm you by day, nor the moon by night. And the Lord will keep you from all harm and he will watch

364
00:53:11.229 --> 00:53:20.419
over your life, the Lord will watch over you're coming and you're going both now and forever more.

365
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.879
It's such a beautiful, powerful passage. It's a promise that God is making to all of us that are

366
00:53:29.129 --> 00:53:37.409
pilgrims in this life that we are on our way into the presence of God. And the scriptures remind us

367
00:53:37.419 --> 00:53:42.830
that when we lift up our eyes to the mountains, that's where our help is gonna come from. I don't

368
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:49.719
know about you, but when you look up at a mountain, all you see is how high it is and how far it is

369
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:55.780
and how long it could possibly take for that help to come

370
00:53:57.899 --> 00:54:03.540
see the higher the mountain. Then you know the more danger dangerous, the trek, even for the person

371
00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:11.280
who is coming to our, to our aid, the amount of time that it would take. You know, we're not talking

372
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.360
about you know our Mount Royal here,

373
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:26.120
you could be down that thing in 30 minutes. But, but when they were looking at a mountain of the

374
00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:36.399
stature in which they're speaking of, they're looking at something that was not just high and far,

375
00:54:36.409 --> 00:54:44.580
but it was also dangerous to descend. And I don't know how long it's been taking for God to answer

376
00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:49.850
your prayer. And maybe it feels like he's just ignoring you outright.

377
00:54:52.080 --> 00:55:01.550
But the reason this passage is so powerful is that, is that the psalmist knows no matter what, no

378
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:13.040
matter how long it takes, no matter what happens in between God is going to come and help.

379
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.439
And he has that hope. Do you

380
00:55:20.719 --> 00:55:29.709
or along the way, have you just like given up thinking that it's not going to happen? And so in the

381
00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:35.110
book of lamentations, we were reminded of this truth,

382
00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:44.459
truths that I want us to remember when we're battling depression. And the first is that your

383
00:55:44.469 --> 00:55:51.979
emotions are always valid, but they're never permanent. And so I want you to let yourself hope.

384
00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:03.290
And the passage that speaks directly to this is found in, in Jeremiah's own words, see Jeremiah in,

385
00:56:03.469 --> 00:56:11.110
in, in, in chapter three and verse 21 he says this, I dare to hope

386
00:56:13.719 --> 00:56:15.889
when I remember this

387
00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:25.489
and he's referring to the fact that that God is his hope, no matter what the circumstances are

388
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:33.090
telling Him, no matter what he's lived and experienced. You see, he's looking at his life and he's

389
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:39.770
looking at his circumstances and he's saying my emotions they're valid, but they're not permanent

390
00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:48.389
and I can't trust them. And so I'm going to let myself hope. The second thing is that your situation

391
00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:53.270
may feel hopeless. But with God, there's always hope.

392
00:56:55.429 --> 00:57:05.250
And that's why in verse 22 23 he says, the faithful love of the Lord never ends his mercies, never

393
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:15.750
cease. Great is His faithfulness because His mercies begin afresh each morning. There's always

394
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.689
hope with the Lord.

395
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:28.459
The third thing is that when you're naming your emotions, it opens the door to changing your

396
00:57:28.469 --> 00:57:37.399
emotions. And that's when hope can appear. You see if you don't name what it is that you're going

397
00:57:37.409 --> 00:57:43.110
through, then you're not going to be able to have the breakthrough that you've been wanting and

398
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:50.419
anticipating and expecting to take place. And that's why in verse 24 this is what Jeremiah says. He

399
00:57:50.429 --> 00:58:00.850
says, I say to myself, the Lord is my inheritance and therefore I will hope in him that beautiful.

400
00:58:01.949 --> 00:58:10.129
He goes right to the source. He goes right to the fullness of what it means to be a son and a

401
00:58:10.139 --> 00:58:23.919
daughter of our heavenly father. We are not just those who inherit, we are his inheritance. See, he

402
00:58:23.929 --> 00:58:31.669
loves us to the point where he has made us our inheritance to the point where he gives his son. So

403
00:58:31.679 --> 00:58:39.060
we will experience the fullness of the inheritance. He doesn't just makes us sons and daughters, but

404
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:46.320
he makes us inheritors of everything that he has to offer. You believe that. See, if you believe

405
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:56.020
that you cannot not have faith, if you believe that you will always have faith, you will always have

406
00:58:56.030 --> 00:59:01.860
hope. You will always be able to believe that things can turn around and be different.

407
00:59:04.159 --> 00:59:14.139
Here's another truth. We're not going to make permanent decisions based on temporary emotions

408
00:59:14.959 --> 00:59:22.520
because our hope is built waiting on the Lord. If we want to follow our emotions, it's always going

409
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:29.780
to lead us to a place that is far from hope and possibly to a place that is just waiting for us that

410
00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:34.239
is called depression. And so God is saying, I want you to do something else that when things are not

411
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:41.969
going as planned and they're not going according to what you had hoped and things are looking like

412
00:59:41.979 --> 00:59:49.649
they cannot turn around. Here's what I want you to do. And Jeremiah gives us the key in verse 25.

413
00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:59.030
This is what he says. He says the Lord is good to those who depend on him, to those who searched for

414
00:59:59.040 --> 00:59:59.350
him.

415
01:00:02.189 --> 01:00:14.290
So it is good to wait quietly for salvation from the Lord. So God is reminding us is that we are not

416
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:25.550
going to see things change unless we make a decision to hope in the Lord and to wait on the Lord for

417
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:34.649
that good word that gives us the hope that we need. And as we wait on the Lord, he promises to give

418
01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:46.020
it, he promises to remind us of how he has an inheritance for us, of how he is the one who can save

419
01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:56.290
us regardless of the situation, regardless of the circumstances that he will be your salvation. And

420
01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:06.000
so let's go back now and think about the place in our life where earlier on I asked you, where is it

421
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:13.330
that you have lost hope? Go back to that place now and look at it differently from the perspective

422
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:21.020
of even someone who was lamenting and going through one of the most challenging times in his life,

423
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.310
the prophet Jeremiah,

424
01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:34.570
a place in which he was in between two places he was in between pain and he was in between praise.

425
01:01:37.629 --> 01:01:44.300
You see, we lament when we're stuck in between those two places,

426
01:01:46.850 --> 01:02:00.030
when we're stuck between the pain and we're stuck between the praise. But God says I can give you a

427
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:09.770
good word if you will be good soil, so I can move you out of the pain towards the praise

428
01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:14.739
and renew your hope right now.

429
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:25.600
Are you ready for God to do that in your life? Are you ready for Him to give you hope? What is it

430
01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:33.489
that you believe? God cannot resurrect? What is it that you believe that God cannot bring back to

431
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.439
life? Do you know that in the Scriptures? For something to live, it must die.

432
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:49.879
That's who Jesus is to us. He proves to us the promise that in his death,

433
01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:59.260
he can live again. But more importantly, everything that we see die can be brought back to life in a

434
01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:03.649
new way. Jeremiah said he could make

435
01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:14.209
new mercies a fresh every morning. You believe that for your life, that he can do something new for

436
01:03:14.219 --> 01:03:23.600
you, that he can do something in your life where you are not depending enough on Him for you're

437
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:28.739
depending on someone and something else, but not on the Lord. And God is saying, depend on me

438
01:03:29.129 --> 01:03:35.159
because I want to be the good word. I just need you to be the good soil. God bless you guys. Thank

439
01:03:35.169 --> 01:03:35.830
you so much.

440
01:03:43.479 --> 01:03:50.500
Father. I want to thank you for every person here who has just spoken to you in this place and

441
01:03:53.489 --> 01:03:58.959
just spoken to you through their minds and their hearts of where it is that they have lost hope and

442
01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:06.449
where they need you to reignite it. They need a good word from you, Lord. And we pray for that. We

443
01:04:06.459 --> 01:04:11.580
pray for that just like you gave it to Jeremiah and he helped them overcome. Lord. Would you help

444
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:17.629
them overcome and through the principles that we have looked at today. May they help us, may they

445
01:04:17.639 --> 01:04:23.530
guide us? May they instruct us in the way that we must watch so that we can experience the fullness

446
01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:30.179
of the inheritance that you have for us. You have great things in store for every person here. Lord,

447
01:04:30.189 --> 01:04:35.139
you want to do great things in their life. You want to give them great things. That's who you are

448
01:04:35.149 --> 01:04:42.600
because you're a great God and we thank you heavenly Father that you are here for them and that you

449
01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:51.030
will speak hope into their life. That is the good soil in which it needs to flourish. And we pray

450
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:59.239
this in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit one God. Amen. Amen. God bless

451

you guys.

452
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:08.290
Hey, would you just stand as we will close uh with the worship team? Um You want to hear this song,

453
01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:13.639
you want to hear these words, you want to sing along with all of your heart. It's not going to just

454
01:05:13.649 --> 01:05:17.810
change your mind, it's gonna touch your heart. And I believe that today we're going to hear

455
01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:24.429
something that is going to fit so perfectly with what we've just been experiencing together. And so
