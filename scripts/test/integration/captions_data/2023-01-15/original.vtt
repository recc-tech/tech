00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:51.800
Hello. Welcome everyone. Welcome to River's Edge. If you're in person, if you're online, we love you.

2
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:58.980
Um, if you're online, we'd love to invite you to come out um, in person sometime. So yeah, welcome

3
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.410
and we hope you guys had a great christmas and a great New Years. It was refreshing for me, I don't

4
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:10.230
know about you, just to take a break. Um, but it's great to be back in community together, so we're

5
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:17.810
glad you're here. Um, and we also want you to remember that you belong before you believe. I know we

6
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.540
say that every week, but it really matters. Um, it's not a catchphrase, it's not something we just

7
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.000
say, it's a cliche like you can come in your mess and your Brokenness and wherever you're at. Um,

8
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.400
because jesus loves you right then and there and we do too. So we want to be the hands and feet of

9
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.910
jesus, that's what the church is. We are the church. So we're gonna go ahead and stand to our feet,

10
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.350
get our hearts postured ready for worship in a place of surrender. Um, and just remember this is

11
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.620
about you and the Lord. So think of it as like, you know, we're up here helping facilitate something

12
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.940
that is going on between you and your heart and the Lord's heart. So yeah, let's stand to our feet

13
00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.030
and welcome the rivers said worship team. And then after that we will have pastors Oh, come out for

14
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.710
our message.

15
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:13.750
Thanks Christina. You hear me okay there we are. Let's start this off with prayer. All right, just

17
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.380
yours and it all belongs to you Lord. I pray for those just for everyone here fathers. Maybe there's

18
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.910
some some of us who just took everything just to come to fight the snow and the winter gloom. But

19
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.070
Lord, this is your house where we come to experience you. We want to know you, we want to love on

20
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:39.510
you, Lord. So reveal yourself. Lead us through this time of worship God it all belongs to you. It all

21
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.630
belongs to you, jesus your name. I pray. Amen

22
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.380
we wish it

23
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.940

24
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:02.720
Yeah,

33
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.680
Okay. Mhm

34
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.470
bust the Lord bless the Lord.

35
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.420
Yeah,

36
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.020
decide

37
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.320
10,000. My

38
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:55.740
worship

39
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.520
seem like

40
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:20.240
when my strength is failing the end draws near and my

41
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.060
right

42
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.970
seeing your

43
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.470
10,000

44
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:00.980
the Lord

45
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.980
man, you gotta clap.

46
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.280
So before we start this next song, I'd like to would you guys just give a warm welcome to our

47
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:07.140
keyboard player that's sam valentine. Show him some love that boy is shredding it. We're blessed man.

48
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:15.100
Thank you. Um So before we get into this next song um I think some of the hard talking to pastors.

49
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.960
Oh and one of the hard things about worship sometimes is that we don't always believe or feel what

50
00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.900
we're singing and I don't know where everybody's at right now in their journey and their, in their

51
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:31.990
walk with the Lord, but gratitude is always a good starting point. And so this song is just a direct,

52
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:38.510
it just speaks into that. So just encourage you guys just don't be shy, sing it. Ladies are gonna

53
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.800
take this one and uh leave it at that

54
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:02.910
never

55
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.540
to fully know

56
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.750
there is no,

57
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.260
you assume the best

58
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.700
saving me

59
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.920
everything. I have

60
00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:01.390
some of my attention measured in. The praise

61
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.060
was

62
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:44.990
was

63
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:00.990
I was,

64
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.460
hello

65
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.970
man, guys can be seated,

66
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:52.570
I feel refreshed. Hope you guys feel refreshed. Um okay, so I have some announcements I want to give

67
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:58.600
you before we go ahead and move forward with the message. So first things first, the community

68
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:05.480
fundraiser, Community hall fundraiser. Um this is our first, our first phase of it, so we haven't

69
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.960
been having it yet, but it's our first phase. We're gonna watch a video first to understand it and

70
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.670
then I'm going to give you an update. So

71
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:22.240
Hay River's Edge, it's a beautiful january winter uh here in our city and I wanted to just introduce

72
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:28.140
our community hall and this is the way that our guests would be coming in so obviously you can also

73
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:35.040
access the community hall from inside the building, but on a normal monday or thursday, any day of

74
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.700
the week really, whenever we have activities going on, this would be the door that everyone would

75
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.140
use,

76
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:49.240
We've got this great wide entrance that's gonna be painted, these steps are gonna be secured and we

77
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:56.760
now have a vestibule that's been built to keep the cold air out and this cold air won't make its way

78
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:02.710
into the community hall. This is the big space that we have been working on, we took down the

79
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:11.810
ceiling, demoed all the walls, we have new insulation, new lighting, it's all new electrical, these

80
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:18.970
are all LED lights that are installed, new sprinkler system and we have to now get to the finishing

81
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:24.540
stages of this room and that's what the fundraiser is all about. Hi, I'm jesse Brassard, I'm gonna

82
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:31.120
be the contractor working here. Starting off with the open space that Lorenzo showed you here the

83
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:36.690
dining area for the soup kitchen and we're gonna be painting it, finishing up some plastering. And

84
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.490
it's not just this space that you're looking at right here, this large room where we can accommodate

85
00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:48.580
so many activities ministries and groups. But this space right here which is outside of our

86
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.080
industrial kitchen.

87
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:05.190
So this space here serves as a secondary meeting area and dining room and we have two new washrooms

88
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:11.400
that are being put in, they've been doubled in capacity. We're looking at adding showers, but that's

89
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:18.910
gonna be a second phase for right now, we are gonna make those washrooms functional, but we are

90
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:25.980
going to then renovate those completely and that will be phase two of this project, Let me show you

91
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.670
phase three,

92
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:37.610
So this is phase three, this is going to be our youth and young adult hangout space, this is a large

93
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:44.450
room that can be accommodating all of our youth and young adults where we're gonna have games set up

94
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:51.970
and couches and beanbags and that kind of thing. And that space goes into this space as well, so

95
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:59.630
it's double the size that you're seeing right now. This is the second space that would be used by

96
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:07.510
the youth and young adults as well. So we'd have two whole areas dedicated just for them. So this

97
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:13.450
would be phase three. So the first phase is really just the community hall and we're just trying to

98
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:18.890
raise $15,000 for that. Once we've completed that, we're gonna work on the washrooms, that's phase

99
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:24.440
two, we'll update you once we've collected the first amount, what that's gonna cost and then this

100
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.220
will be phase three and there'll be another amount that we need to raise to finish this off once

101
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:36.350
we've done all three phases, it's done all of this is complete community kitchen, all of our youth

102
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:43.090
young adult ministries as well as our kids ministries as well as our daycare can now make full use

103
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:48.700
of this space and it's gonna be a huge benefit, not just to us but to all the community groups that

104
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:55.570
meet on a week to week basis. We have so many groups that need space, and it gives us an opportunity

105
00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:02.140
to also give it out for free, but also to be able to add revenue to our church by renting it out.

106
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:08.450
What's different about this space is that we can now access it from upstairs, so we had to cut

107
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:16.590
through this wall. So, what this means now is that when we come through here, we can access the

108
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:26.150
upstairs as well as when we come down these stairs, we can now make our way back into the community

109
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:33.180
hall, just excited to be part of this. Um you know, it'll be exciting to see it finished and have

110
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:38.260
people in this space, you know, not just be something that's waiting to be done, but something that

111
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:46.080
is done and has, you know, outreach to the community and potential extra events and income for the

112
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:53.420
church. So what a great space and I know that we're already off and running in terms of the money

113
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.640
that we've been trying to collect, and we hope that in the next few weeks we can raise the rest,

114
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:04.390
it's not a huge amount, if we all chip in, we can get this done, they're ready to start working next

115
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:12.990
week, and this is it, this place will be ready to go by february at some point. So what a great

116
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.950
thing for the community kitchen to have its space back to be able to offer its ministries again, and

117
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:23.110
for all of us to be able to have this space for all the other ministries activities and programs

118
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.610
that we have. God bless you guys. Thank you so much for supporting.

119
00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:48.530
Yeah, so hopefully that video kind of gives more of an explanation behind, you know what the whole

120
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:55.430
purpose of this, the renovations are and how it can really help move our ministry is forward. Um

121
00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.550
it takes a village, so we love you guys and we thank you for what you've already given. So I wanted

122
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:08.200
to give you guys an update on what we got last week, which was amazing. So we raised actually 2750

123
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:18.030
out of our $15,000 goal. So, amazing. Really, really guys like it's, we just really appreciate it.

124
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:24.460
Um so, and then just as a reminder, so this, this fundraiser does go over and above what we already

125
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:30.350
have is a budget per week. So we have a weekly budget that goes in that, you know, we also have and

126
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:38.040
then this is above that. So um when you're giving donations to this fund, just make sure to market

127
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.470
their all tax deductible, but you can actually mark it as community Hall, I believe you can write a

128
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:47.740
note on there and that way it's designated to Community Hall and not like a regular giving thing. So

129
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:55.180
hopefully that makes sense. Really guys. Amazing. Amazing. So we're doing great for phase one. Okay,

130
00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.720
Hair is in my face. So next thing is community kitchen, I wanted to just give you guys an update on

131
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:08.720
that too. So on Sunday January 22 after the gathering we're having brunch, so but that is breakfast

132
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.270
food. Pastor Zo wanted me to clarify it will be breakfast food um and then close as well, closed

133
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:19.180
distribution, so that will be after the service on the 22nd, come hang out, come enjoy some really

134
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:25.350
good food and meet some people and yeah, just stay after the service. Next thing is the four ways to

135
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:31.610
give, so we love you guys for you know every all the faithful givers in here and I know it's a heart

136
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:35.950
posture with the Lord, so wherever you're at on your journey with giving um you know, we appreciate

137
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:42.010
you and whatever amount you can give, you know, we just, we appreciate it. Also for ways to give up

138
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:48.710
on the slide, there's lots of different ways, so just choose the one that works best for you and

139
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:53.810
then the after party, so after the service, we always have an after party right by the coffee, so

140
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.520
come say hi, come meet some people, come say hi to me if you've never met me, my name is Christina,

141
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:03.550
so I love meeting new people, so yeah, come say hi after the service and don't run out, we love to

142
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:08.000
just kind of be a community together and get to know each other beyond just, you know, worshiping

143
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.160
together. It's also breaking bread and having coffee together. So, and then I want to just go ahead

144
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.980
and dismiss the kids so kids, you can go to the annex. Um, and then we're gonna watch a video for

145
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.370
you as you head out.

146
00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:05.550
Amazing. Okay, so now I'm gonna welcome pastors. Oh, and I'm super excited for what he's going to

147
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:12.130
speak on today. The messages on don't waste your past. So I was super blessed by last week's message

148
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.560
and I'm pumped for this one. So let's welcome him today as he gives us the message.

149
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:34.170
Did you feel that something just happened that many of us take for granted another year is

150
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:42.650
officially in the past. A chapter is closed and now we look ahead to a new year. The mistakes,

151
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:51.470
missteps and missed opportunities of the past give way to hope, excitement and joy for the new life.

152
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:59.490
God gives us pursuing christ with each new dawn through his grace, we get the chance to reset the

153
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:08.430
clock to forget what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead as we work, play, rest and

154
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:15.530
worship. We know his mercies are new every morning. Those who hope in the Lord will renew their

155
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:24.200
strength arriving at next year's end through his faithfulness. So whatever we do this year, let's

156
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:32.280
give it to God, seeking his will, trusting his plan and taking this opportunity to restart.

157
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:44.940
Hey, good morning. Everyone is so good to be with you. Um you enjoy the worship, the video, all the

158
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:52.010
rest so far so good. We got a great community of faith and so many talented people that make all

159
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:57.990
this happen and we're so glad that we have creatives among us who expressed their gifts so we can be

160
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.690
blessed each and every week. Well we're in this series and it's talking to each of us about not wasting

161
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:10.960
our past. And I know that we try to turn the page pretty quickly when things are unpleasant, but one of

162
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.760
the things that God teaches us through the scriptures is that he wants us to really learn from it

163
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:22.140
and to grow from it and to be able to use the things of the past to be able to create a new and

164
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.940
glorious future that is filled with his blessings. One of the characters in the bible that went

165
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:34.090
through exactly that is joseph and joseph is often seen as a figure of jesus himself, someone who in

166
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:41.870
the scriptures is showing us what it looks like to just be an everyday dude who, where things can

167
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:51.460
happen that are not good and when you are in a situation where people are organized against you,

168
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:58.970
like his own brothers were where they literally had nothing but murderous thoughts on their minds

169
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:07.530
and hearts and put them into action just so that they could remove him from their midst, you know

170
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:13.080
what it's like to feel like the whole world is against you. There are moments in your life where you

171
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:19.980
feel like nothing is going for you, where everything seems to be against you. That's why in the

172
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:26.080
scriptures, when we read about jesus explaining and describing what it would be like for his

173
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:33.310
followers to live in this world, he made it clear that we would face trouble, that they would be

174
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:41.720
tough times. But then he told us to also take courage because with him we would be able to overcome

175
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:49.400
it and overcome the world in which we were in and whatever it is that you're dealing with and facing

176
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:57.250
in your life right now, you need to know that God wants to see you through that. But not before. We

177
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:05.300
have also learned from the past today, we're gonna be talking about how God uses everything for our

178
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:13.260
good. And it's a tough subject difficult because there's so many tragic and traumatic experiences

179
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:20.330
that have occurred that we can't imagine that those things God can use. But when God says that he

180
00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:27.280
can use everything, he means everything. There isn't anything that is excluded from that list. There

181
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:33.550
are things that we exclude from it. There are things that we don't want to remember, things that we

182
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:40.050
don't want to relive things that we don't want to be reminded of. But those are the things that we

183
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:48.510
sometimes never properly heal from, learn from and grow from as a result. And so in the life of

184
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:56.810
joseph, there is a key moment in his life where he's at home and he's the favorite son of many sons

185
00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:04.920
and he's the youngest and the most spoiled. It's clear in the scriptures, that's the case. He's the

186
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:16.070
most loved and God gives him a vision. He gives him a plan and a future for his life. And what

187
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:24.670
joseph does is that in his immaturity, he rushes to tell those that are in his household what that

188
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:32.200
vision, what that plan and what that purpose is, even though he doesn't fully comprehend it and

189
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:40.670
grasp it. But he sees his own personal greatness in it And in seeing his own personal greatness, he

190
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:48.990
describes that greatness and he describes it in the way that he had received it in his dream and as

191
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:58.500
a result, his brothers end up hating him even more. Let's take a look at this passage in Genesis 37.

192
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:04.510
We're going to read just a few verses here in verses 5 to 8. It says that one night joseph had a

193
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:13.450
dream and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him more than ever. Listen to this dream.

194
00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:21.620
He said, we were out in the field and we were tying up bundles of grain and suddenly my bundle stood

195
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:33.200
up and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before mine and his brothers responded. So you

196
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:40.050
think you will be our king, do you do you actually think that you will reign over us and they hated

197
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:49.610
him all the more because of his dreams and the way that he talked about them. And so we can tell

198
00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:55.450
from that last line that this isn't just something that he shared once, but it's something that he

199
00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:04.500
repeatedly shared. It was something that was in constant discussion, at least to a level where it

200
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:15.310
kept coming up and his brother's anger towards him was intensified to the point of hating him and

201
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:24.990
wanting his death. And I I think that we're all repelled by pride. We all have it, but we're all

202
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:38.600
very good at spotting it in someone else. We are experts in seeing people when they are not shining

203
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:48.760
with humility and as a result we point that out and it irritates us, it bothers us and we sometimes

204
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:54.250
don't know how to deal with that. And that's exactly what happens in this story. I don't think that

205
00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:01.130
joseph was intentionally filled with pride, but that's what he was filled with. And I don't think

206
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:09.740
that he set out to turn his family upside down like he did and have his brother's revolt against him.

207
00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:17.130
But that's what happened. And so there was a level of immaturity that was clearly evident in

208
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:25.330
joseph's life that God needed to deal with before he could have that dream that he had truly given

209
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:35.130
him realized the things of this life have a way of humbling us and preparing us for what God has for

210
00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:44.070
us, Like nothing else. I wish that I would just be an obedient son to the father in heaven, the way

211
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:52.360
that he wants me to. But I have learned that in my stubbornness, rebellion ist and an attitude. And

212
00:41:52.360 --> 00:42:00.870
even in my inability to humble myself in times in which that was clearly the path instead of the one

213
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:10.430
of pride that I chose instead that I needed to go through certain things and be humbled by them.

214
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:19.250
Instead, I wasn't gonna learn my lesson any other way. And so God used this life and the things of

215
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:27.530
this life to show me the things that were hidden in my life so that he could show me the things that

216
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:41.520
he has for my life that I had never seen or truly understood before. The things that are hidden or

217
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:49.840
the things that God wants to reveal, because what he has revealed at the very beginning is greater

218
00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.790
than anything any one of us in this room can imagine for ourselves.

219
00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:07.790
And so here's the thing And we learned this from joseph. That the biggest danger to ourselves is

220
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.510
ourselves.

221
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.540
The danger wasn't his brothers

222
00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:28.560
until joseph created an environment by the telling of his dream for his brothers to want to hate him

223
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:35.320
and kill him. And we often just think about this story and think, well how rotten are these brothers

224
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:47.140
and how how discussing it is for this household to want to kill one of their own. But what we don't

225
00:43:47.140 --> 00:44:00.390
see in the story is joseph's part in it. And what part joseph plays is clear he spoke of his dream

226
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:05.560
and shared it in a manner that incited riot

227
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.160
in the hearts of his brothers.

228
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:20.780
And I believe that many times we are the ones who are responsible for our own trajectory of pain.

229
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:31.530
And and sometimes it's through the actual simple revelation of the great things that we know that

230
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:39.060
not only God has put in our heart, but the great things that we know we were meant for in this life.

231
00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:51.400
And if we don't go about it the right way that God will use those around us to make sure that we

232
00:44:51.400 --> 00:45:04.670
understand what the right way is. I like when I discover a shortcut, have you ever driven somewhere

233
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:12.060
and just came across a faster way of getting to your destination? Just a quicker way of getting

234
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:21.620
there. That didn't involve just blindly following an app. And there's a preference that each of us

235
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:31.150
has when we're driving for apps. My wife is devoted to the God of ways and anybody else. I cannot

236
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:37.490
get her to use anything else. She just will not use anything else. I hate that app for the simple

237
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:42.990
purpose. Reason that it always tells you to take a left and a right, when you can just sometimes

238
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:50.270
just go straight. There's no reason to take that left and right. It just demands it because it it

239
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:56.670
has somehow figured out that it's going to get you there quicker. And sometimes I don't want that, I

240
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:06.480
I don't need that, I just want the straightest route there. But enough of me and this app, I

241
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:14.260
sometimes just like it when I figured it out on my own, just driving just without the app, just oh

242
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:23.030
if I turn here and if I go here and if I do this, I can actually get there quicker. I actually know

243
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:33.690
salvar routes home from this church that never ever come up on any app, they never show me, but I

244
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:41.080
know them and I love it because when one route is closed and I see everybody else down blindly

245
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:52.000
looking at the app that they prefer. I have found my way. I bring this up because I'm proud

246
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:52.490
of it.

247
00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:06.120
The reason of pride for me that I know this and when I share it, I try to do it humbly, but

248
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.270
but when you're better than ways

249
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:24.100
and you're better than google and you're better than maps, like, like honestly when you're better

250
00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.120
than all of them put together, how can you stay humble?

251
00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:42.750
Sometimes you don't realize Pride is in you, but it's there and you don't know how it's gonna reveal

252
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:51.970
itself, it could be in something as ridiculous as just a route home and you don't realize the danger

253
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:58.830
you are to yourself and to others as a result of it. You don't think that this could possibly be a

254
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:06.750
problem. But then all of a sudden this starts to reveal itself in other areas. And that's the thing

255
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:10.320
with pride is that you cannot limit where it goes,

256
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:22.660
you cannot stop how it damages you and others

257
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:34.050
and and the effect that it has can be so incredibly destructive. I I know that if this year you have

258
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:42.650
set goals for yourself and you're saying listen in 2023 I want this year to be like no other, I am

259
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:50.790
done, I am so done with the failures of the past. This is it. I really want this year to be

260
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:58.690
different And you wake up most days with that burning desire in you saying this is gonna be a year

261
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:07.350
like like no other that they know this that sometimes we are the very reason we don't experience

262
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:17.730
more. The quarrels in joseph's family came out of the blessing that God had given him. We sometimes

263
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:25.080
think that the quarrels come just from the evil that is in us. But sometimes no, it's a gift from

264
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:33.420
God to see what he saw to know what his future would be. And yet it got corrupted in his essence. It

265
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:40.580
was pure when God gave it to him. But somehow when it got to him, joseph didn't know how to manage

266
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:47.450
that he didn't know what to do with that. He didn't know how to do something beautiful with it in

267
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:53.850
the same way that he had received it because he just wasn't prepared for it. So sometimes we can

268
00:49:53.850 --> 00:50:04.010
receive the greatest gift, but it gets corrupted by us In James chapter four And in verses 1-3, this

269
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:11.900
is what James is talking about. He says, what is causing the quarrels and the fights among you. And

270
00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.420
he says, don't they come from the evil desires that at war within you?

271
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:26.390
He's saying, don't you see that he just comes from within you. The quarrels and the fights. It's not

272
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:35.650
coming from someone on the outside, it's just coming from from you and you want what you don't have

273
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:46.560
look at this. And so you scheme and you killed to get it. That sound like what his brothers, you're

274
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:57.170
jealous of what others have and you can't get it. And so you fight and you wage war to take it away

275
00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:09.410
from them. Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it. Yeah. And then the

276
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:19.930
following verse says, and even when you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong

277
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:26.610
because you want only what will give you pleasure. And so God is saying like when you're when you're

278
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:34.810
setting out in this year to to have a year, like no other then you need to make sure that you are

279
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:43.490
the reason why that doesn't happen that that that isn't the reason why it isn't accomplished. If you

280
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:49.480
go back to verse two here in this passage, it talks about how it can be on the opposite side. Not

281
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:54.910
someone who's received the dream, but one who wants to receive it. And hearing someone talk about

282
00:51:54.910 --> 00:52:02.420
their dream turns us into the murdering brothers in this story where we will do whatever it takes to

283
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:07.800
take it away from others so that we can have it for ourselves and then we will fight and we will

284
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:16.510
wage war until we do. And then verse three reminds us very clearly that even when we do ask, when we

285
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:23.500
go back to God and we ask God to bless us, we ask God to work in us. We ask God to do something

286
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:32.630
great through us. He says, I can't because your motives are still wrong. I need you to address the

287
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:40.720
motives over your heart. I've given you something pure, which is what he did to joseph, and I'm

288
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.530
ready to give you something even greater because that's what the vision spoke about. But the problem

289
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:54.980
is that right now, when I give it to you, you aren't ready for it, and I need to keep working in

290
00:52:54.980 --> 00:53:02.660
your life. And so what happens is that joseph goes through a series of events and we can't get into

291
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:09.580
everything that happened to joseph in his life, but he gets sold into slavery as opposed to being

292
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:15.650
killed. His brothers can't go through with it. He ends up being bought by a slave master who then

293
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:23.950
takes him and puts him in his own house. He then gets tempted every day by the master's wife to

294
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:33.250
sleep with her and every day he resists her until one day he has to run from her and others see this

295
00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:42.370
happen and she has no other recourse but to blame joseph so that she herself doesn't lose her status

296
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:51.760
in potter's house. And so potter for who is in this case his slave master throws him into jail and

297
00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:59.440
then in jail, joseph now has been wrongly accused by his employer

298
00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:11.790
and yet the evidence has pointed to the contrary and the eyewitness who has come forth has spoken in

299
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:21.760
a manner in which it has caused him to now remain in jail until they decide what to do next with him.

300
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:30.500
Have you ever been wrongly accused? Have you ever been mostly wrongly accused? But some of it was

301
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:37.800
right because there was enough wrong with it that you could say that that wasn't you, that that

302
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:43.750
didn't happen the way that that they describe it, they got some of it right, but not all of it and

303
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:49.530
it just gave you just enough space to get out of it. Come on be honest, has that ever happened?

304
00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:57.130
Because if it has and you know what it is to be human and what it feels like to be accused and what

305
00:54:57.130 --> 00:55:04.540
it means to have eyes upon you that are passing judgment and an outcome that is so uncertain that it

306
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:11.240
puts fear in your life and in your heart that you will basically say whatever you need to say just

307
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:19.830
to get out of it and some of us just live continuously in that space, I'll tell you someone who

308
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:30.180
didn't live in that space and it was joseph. joseph just denied but ended up being imprisoned Anyways,

309
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:39.880
he didn't do anything wrong but he was accused of it and because of it he could have retaliated but

310
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:49.080
what could he possibly do when he was already powerless. And so unless God gave him power, there was

311
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:56.050
no way that he could get out of the situation that he was in. And if you ever been in a position

312
00:55:56.050 --> 00:56:03.970
where you feel or have felt powerless, you need to understand that in those moments, the one who we

313
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.750
should be looking to

314
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:18.170
for our rescue and for our empowerment is God himself and what joseph does is that he turns to God

315
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:24.930
and what God does is that he creates a scenario and an environment where he becomes a dream

316
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:32.990
interpreter and it makes it possible for him to escape the situation that he's in because he has now

317
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:43.310
become extremely valuable all the way to pharaoh himself and what God did is that he gave someone

318
00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:53.150
who was completely powerless and someone who had experienced wrongdoing and gave him power. Now many

319
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:59.930
of us here know what it feels like to be powerless, know what it means to be judged and condemned

320
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:08.080
and sometimes wrongly accused and convicted, but none of us know what it means to the extent that

321
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:15.950
we're talking about to be elevated to the place of power that joseph was then given and the

322
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:23.440
opportunities that came his way. And I'll tell you that if we want our story to be one where we are

323
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:32.570
no longer in pharaoh's prison, but we are instead at the right hand of pharaoh in a world like this,

324
00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:42.510
it's not gonna happen by our own power. It's gonna happen because God sees us in our powerlessness

325
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:49.970
and gives us the power we need for the moment to be elevated from the prison we are in to get into

326
00:57:49.970 --> 00:58:00.090
the palace that he always destined us for. You cannot go from prison to palace unless God is the one

327
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:07.300
who makes that possible. You can do this on your own, You can try on your own. You can build your

328
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:14.870
fame on your own to a point. But the only thing that lasts are the things that are given by God.

329
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:21.820
Everything else will be temporary. Everything else is fleeting. Everything else will last for a

330
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:29.730
season. But not stand the test of time. When God gives a gift, it isn't just for this earth, it is

331
00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:38.420
then taken and held as a treasure in heaven. You see it is eternal. And so what joseph has to do now

332
00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:45.720
that he has risen to this high place of power in the kingdom of pharaoh is that he now has an

333
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:53.010
opportunity to save his brothers when they come during a time of famine. God keeps speaking to

334
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:58.890
joseph and he keeps speaking to him in dreams and he tells him there's gonna be seven years of

335
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:06.840
famine and then seven years of of harvest that is going to proceed it. So during the harvest years,

336
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:13.750
those seven years of plenty store up as much as you can. And so he gives this advice to pharaoh

337
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:18.500
pharaoh listens to him, puts him in charge of this project And now all the other nations are

338
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:27.590
starving except for Egypt and pharaoh now has seen what is happening, he's getting richer by the day

339
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:36.570
because during the famine, people are treating all of their wealth for food and pharaoh becomes even

340
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:44.190
greater than he ever did before. And it was because of the favor that was on joseph's life. And now

341
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:52.590
this man who was in prison who's now in the palace has an opportunity to now turn on his brothers

342
00:59:52.590 --> 01:00:01.810
when they come them to now looking for food. And he does something that was completely unexpected.

343
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:11.740
He resists the temptation for retaliation. And so I want you to understand that that when we want

344
01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:18.980
the blessing of God in our lives, it is going to come by understanding that number one, we are the

345
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:27.500
greatest danger to ourselves. And then number two, we have to resist the temptation for retaliation

346
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:37.170
at all costs. That if we will follow this principle, we will understand what this verse means. In

347
01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:45.650
chapter 15 verse 19, Joseph replies to his brothers, I don't want you to be afraid of me, and then

348
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:55.830
he says these words and my God, that I can punish you. He c he saw himself as someone who was also

349
01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:04.570
under God, not someone who had the power to execute retaliation and revenge, even though he was in a

350
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:12.150
position of power to do it. Do you know what humility is humility is having power and choosing not

351
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:23.250
to use it. It means having control and relinquishing it, It means having an opportunity and

352
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:31.270
sacrificing it. It means doing something for yourself and instead you choose to do something for

353
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:41.840
someone else. See it is the opposite of what pride is continuously pushing us to do. What is pushing

354
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:53.540
us continuously to live as someone who is always looking out for their own best interests. It is

355
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.920
counter to our

356
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:09.870
patterns. It is counter to our society. It is counter to what we see, even from the people that we

357
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:21.010
trust the most It is countered to all that we witness day in and day out. We see people getting

358
01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:30.580
ahead and we say, this is the way to do it. You've gotta be ruthless. You've got to be driven.

359
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:40.220
You've got to be focused, you've got to be a planner. You've got to be someone who sacrifices

360
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:49.440
everything to be able to achieve what it takes. And then, and then you can look back and be

361
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:51.630
fulfilled.

362
01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:59.830
The most fulfilled people I have met in my life and the moments where I have been the most fulfilled

363
01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:07.660
in my life has been when I have exercised humility and never pride. Just those moments where I have

364
01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:15.360
felt the enlightenment of God. I have felt his presence, I have felt his love. I have felt enveloped

365
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:21.120
by something that was greater and more powerful than anything that I could ever have done for myself

366
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:27.100
when I have given myself away so that someone else can be blessed. Those were the greatest moments

367
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:33.300
of my life. Those were the moments where I know I was the most pure in mind and heart and in life it

368
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:40.700
is in those moments when I revealed humility and resisted retaliation and pride and the opportunity

369
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:47.170
to seize and to take and to bring things into my life. It is those moments when I have resisted

370
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:56.260
those things that I have been most like jesus and I want to encourage you that if you can see what

371
01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:03.690
joseph sees in that moment where he sees that he is not God and it is not for him to bring about

372
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:11.020
this justice and so he sees another principle and I want to share it with you is that he sees God's

373
01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:20.730
hand in everything. And I know it's hard to see God's hand in everything, especially in the dark,

374
01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:29.890
especially those things that are, that are evil and those things that are maybe just in the shadows.

375
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:42.660
But in genesis chapter 50 and verse 20 and 21, it says that he gets it and reveals it and he speaks

376
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:51.580
it into his brother's life. He doesn't just say that he isn't God and he leaves it to God. But he

377
01:04:51.580 --> 01:05:03.500
says to them, you intended to harm me? But God intended it all forget he brought me to this position

378
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:12.620
so I could save the lives of many people. So no, don't be afraid. I will continue to take care of

379
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:21.320
you and your Children. And so he reassured them by speaking kindly to them. It's a beautiful verse

380
01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:29.150
right? He had an opportunity there to to really give them a tongue lashing that they deserved. Like

381
01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.130
just put it to them of what they had done. And it's not that he couldn't have said, hey, maybe I was

382
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:40.880
just a dumb kid and I had pride in me and I never should have shared my dream with you the way that

383
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:46.510
I did and spoke to you guys the way, but you were my brothers. I never would have thought that you

384
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:52.910
would have tried to kill me and then sold me off into slavery. I spent the majority of my life in a

385
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:59.370
foreign land serving a foreign ruler away from our father. And I never got to grow up in a family.

386
01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:07.950
Yes, I have a family of my own today, but I've named my Children over my about my suffering. I've

387
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:14.970
named them after the conflicts that I have lived in my heart and in my life, he was a person who was

388
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:23.320
experiencing great blessing in Egypt, but that never felt free because of what had happened to him.

389
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:33.320
And until you get to the place where you can trust God for it all, where you can look at him and say

390
01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:39.930
everything that you meant for evil, I now see that God has been in control all along. Everything

391
01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:48.370
that you meant to hurt me with God has used and he has brought me to this place of blessing instead.

392
01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:55.650
Are you able to do that right now? To look on your past and to say, I'm gonna trust you God for

393
01:06:55.650 --> 01:07:03.780
everything. I'm gonna believe in you for everything that everything that has happened to me has been

394
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:13.360
for my good. Can can you, can you fathom that for a moment? Everything that has happened has been

395
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:19.150
for my good. And you think, but how, how is that possible when, when it hasn't been good, you see

396
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:25.400
you trust God and God says, I'm going to take this pain, this trauma, this tragedy? I'm gonna take

397
01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:32.450
this moment that you would obviously not have wanted to go through and I'm going to turn it around

398
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.440
and give it back to you good.

399
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:43.700
And the only one who could do that is God. You see, I can't do that. I have not been able to take

400
01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:51.350
one traumatic experience in my life and turned it into something good. I have not been able to do

401
01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:59.990
that. It leads me back to a place of anger, resentment and a desire for retaliation. Anybody else

402
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:14.850
see every time I go and revisit my past, that's what happens until I say, I trust you God, that

403
01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:21.760
everything that has been allowed in my life, everything that has happened, You were able to take it

404
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:31.880
everything and turn it into good for me. Can you do that right now? Just in your mind and in your

405
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:42.970
heart say God, I give you everything and I ask you to turn it into good for me. Take that, which I

406
01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:54.100
hate, take that, which I'm still angry about take that, which I cannot forgive, take that, which I

407
01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:03.030
cannot let go of, take that, which is still ongoing, hasn't even ended yet. Still happening. Take

408
01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:09.940
all of that and turn it into good in my life in jesus name,

409
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:18.760
pray that with me. And every time those evil thoughts come back every time, thoughts of retaliation

410
01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:25.160
come back every time your heart goes dark and it goes angry and it wants revenge and wants vengeance

411
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.310
and it wants retaliation. Go back to the place where you give it back to God and say God, you take

412
01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:37.180
it and you turn it into good for me and you will see that you will get to that very place where

413
01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:45.690
joseph is finally free. And you know when you know you're free, when you're faced with it again, I

414
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:52.810
remember hating a person so much because of the harm that had done to me and my family, that I just

415
01:09:54.690 --> 01:10:01.540
I didn't know how to do what I would say if I ever saw them. And one day I was on vacation with my

416
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:07.050
family. I was like, you know, my wife and my kids and we were somewhere and I get out of my car,

417
01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:12.710
we're in a parking lot and and who was in that same parking lot. But that person who did that.

418
01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:23.070
And I thought to myself, man of all places, you know, like I'm here to get away from from the

419
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:28.610
pressures of this life. I don't wanna be brought right here right now is what God does. It doesn't

420
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:36.910
let you off the hook. Ever, ever you'll always have to confront the past at some point, we

421
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:41.290
understand that, right? But what he says to us, I don't want you to waste your past.

422
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:49.660
I don't know what came over me, but in that moment, I don't know it was it was beyond me. It was it

423
01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:55.680
was supernatural. I could have held on to my my hate, my anger, my resentment retaliation. And I'm

424
01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.420
telling you that this wasn't even two years removed from, from all having happened, that it was

425
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:07.070
still fresh, you know with the wounds man, you could still feel them healing. You understand what

426
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:14.060
I'm saying? It's still painful just thinking about it. And I remember just coming out of the car and

427
01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:21.190
seeing this person walking right up to them and just flowed from my my lips in a way that I never

428
01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:24.640
thought possible is that I I forgive you and I release you.

429
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:36.010
And in that moment, what I didn't realize is that I had released myself and I have never again

430
01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:43.600
thought back in the same way on those moments and those moments have been lessons to me that I have

431
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:50.600
held on to and learned from and grown from and been able to apply in my everyday life because I took

432
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:58.270
a moment to just whisper a prayer before I went and met this person face to face. And I just said

433
01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.700
God help me,

434
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:13.440
that's all. There was time for a prayer in my head real quick and in that moment it changed

435
01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:19.020
everything in Romans eight verse 28-32, it says this,

436
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:31.610
we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are

437
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:39.820
called according to his purpose for them. That's his promise. Then he says for God knew his people

438
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:47.680
in advance and he chose them to become like his son so that his son would be the firstborn among

439
01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:57.260
many brothers and sisters. And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called

440
01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:03.580
them, he gave them right standing with himself and having given them right standing look at this, he

441
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:15.170
gave them glory. What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us then who

442
01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:24.770
could ever be against us? And since he did not spare even his own son but gave him up for us all,

443
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:35.370
won't he also give us everything else. Mhm. God says that. I want you to understand that this is my

444
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:45.810
promise to you. Would you trust me with this? Would you believe in this? And would you Walk in this

445
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:52.990
in 2023, God bless you guys thank you so much. Would you stand close in a word of prayer,

446
01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:02.590
Father, I want to thank you for every person that has received a dream from you and you're helping

447
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:11.490
them to walk in it, Lord, where they are living out your purpose with your hand upon them, helping

448
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:20.110
them to make sense of of the past but not allowing it to be wasted but used by you so that all

449
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:31.920
things can work for their good Lord. You want to use every bit of it every part of it. There is

450
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:40.370
nothing that you cannot use for their good and you are going to do great things in them and through

451
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:51.710
them. Even through those things that we had hoped to never remember or relive again. And today Lord

452
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:59.060
we are taught that you can do something with it all and that it doesn't have to hold this back but

453
01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:07.360
it can actually propel us forward like never before and so father, we give it over to you and we ask

454
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:19.300
you to work your good and all and in everything that is in our life, in jesus name, we pray Amen,

455
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:22.460
Amen God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

456
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:35.200
It's such a perfect song to end with its it's about the transitions that God can Just bring us two

457
01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:38.380
and it's called Graves into gardens. Let's sing it together.

458
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.740
Sorry,

459
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:51.060
don't just sing this song. I want you guys to claim this song. This is for us. All right

460
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:38.230
now satisfied.

461
01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.190
There's nothing

462
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:09.450
I'm not afraid.

463
01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:19.890
My

464
01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:28.270
come on, that's good news.

465
01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:02.280
Yeah.

466
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:39.650
Mhm

467
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.780
kids.

468
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:05.310
Yeah.

469
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:30.320
Yeah.

470
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:27.030
Well I just want to remind you guys that you know, whatever comes your way, you can trust God today.

471
01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.290
He can turn Graves into gardens, whatever feels dead, Whatever feels broken. You can trust him today.

472
01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:38.590
Okay, so just keep that in mind. I love what Pastor Zo said, we can trust God always just putting

473
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:43.820
that back into his hands whatever it is that you're thinking of right now. We all have something. Um

474
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:48.610
I also want to thank you guys again for your generosity. We love you and we appreciate you. And just

475
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:54.120
remember that there is always a seed that gets sewn, anything that you give at any time the Lord

476
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.950
sees it and he honors it. Even if we don't always see the fruit. Um Sometimes we do, sometimes we

477
01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:04.090
don't, but there's a seed that gets planted. So I just want to remind you of that as well. Um and
