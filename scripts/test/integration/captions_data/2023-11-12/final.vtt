1
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.019
I am seeking,

2
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:34.980
searching for the things this world has rejected, the things that are broken that are flawed, thrown

3
00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:36.880
away and discarded.

4
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:47.859
I seek the lost, the damaged, the forgotten things, the overlooked and the neglected,

5
00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:54.299
the things that have been pushed aside and left behind.

6
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.899
Why, why do I do this?

7
00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.589
Why? Chase after that, which is despised by so many.

8
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:24.390
It is because I have chosen the rejected. I bring restoration to the broken. I see beyond the flaws

9
00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:31.690
and the imperfections and I bring new life to the loss. This world has called them useless and

10
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.750
garbage, hopeless and unwanted.

11
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:48.109
They have been scarred, abused, ignored and unloved, but I, I have reclaimed them and they belong to

12
00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:57.250
me now. They are my masterpiece and I have a plan and a future for every single one

13
00:08:00.989 --> 00:08:08.329
for. I am crafting these dissonant and discarded pieces into something beautiful

14
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:33.179
to river's edge church. We are so blessed that you could join us in person today. For this gathering.

15
00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:40.979
We are here to welcome and accept you the way you are and help you live an authentic life of faith,

16
00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:50.080
love and hope. Let's also welcome our online community joining us from various platforms. Today is a

17
00:08:50.090 --> 00:09:00.020
joy to have you all with us. We also want to remind you that each Sunday our youth ministry starts

18
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:10.039
at 10 a.m. and the kids ministry starts at 10:30 a.m. We have a wonderful gathering plan for you. We

19
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:18.469
are continuing with our new series called Rejected and we will also be enjoying the community

20
00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:26.849
kitchen brunch after the gathering today and this is for everyone and please stand and let's welcome

21
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.969
the River's edge worship team. As we sing the first song today.

32
00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:01.020
Thank you God. Thank you Jesus that you're here.

33
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:13.739
Thank you that your love never fails that it's never ending. It's all consuming. It's a fire. God.

34
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:20.849
We just pray for that fire this morning. We pray for that fire that you would just set a fire in all

35
00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:30.919
our souls, Jesus, you're here, you're moving. This is not just another Sunday. It's another chance

36
00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:37.109
that we get to gather together. And I thank you God for that. And I just pray that we would have a

37
00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:42.989
heightened awareness of you right now of your presence, that your presence would be the strongest

38
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.090
force in this room. You're already here. God. We just give you space to move. Come rest on us. Holy

39
00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:56.270
Spirit, come rest on us. You know, every heart. I pray every heart here would find the healing they

40
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:05.429
need today as we sing together. I just want to encourage you all. Keep your eyes focused on him.

41
00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:12.909
Keep your eyes focused on his love as we sing this song. OK. Let's actually let's clap guys. Come on,

42
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.969
let's go. Let's break things up.

63
00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:56.209
All right, he makes all things work together for our good. We're gonna sing this out. OK? Make all

64
00:18:56.219 --> 00:19:06.770
things work together for my good. Lift your voice, lift your song. You may all things work together,

65
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:18.550
the mind I sing it again. You make all things work together good. Remind your soul. Remind your how

66
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.479
all things work together. Good. Come on, I wanna hear you. Let's go.

100
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:23.099
They are more than just names, more than blocks of stone set in rows,

101
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:35.810
more than memories. They are our brothers and sisters, our parents and our Children,

102
00:25:38.229 --> 00:25:47.770
friends, loved ones and even strangers who believe that we were worth fighting for that. We were

103
00:25:47.780 --> 00:26:00.670
worth dying for. They stand for justice, for courage, for heroism and fearlessness in the face of

104
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:11.209
danger. They stand for the brave men and women who selflessly answered the call and gave their very

105
00:26:11.219 --> 00:26:20.979
lives for the cause of freedom. Let us never take their sacrifice for granted. But instead remember

106
00:26:20.989 --> 00:26:29.310
with gratitude, those who have served today tomorrow and every day thereafter

107
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:42.579
by the grace of God. If we walk upon free soil, if we breathe in the sweetness of liberty, let us

108
00:26:42.589 --> 00:26:50.250
give thanks. Let us honor the fallen and let us never forget.

109
00:26:59.089 --> 00:27:06.930
Good morning. Once again, we have some important announcements to share with you for the serve team.

122
00:28:54.989 --> 00:29:02.800
Ok. And now we are going for the message. Let us all welcome our senior

123
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.069
pastor, Pastor Lorenzo DellaForesta.

124
00:29:24.949 --> 00:29:33.650
Welcome, everybody so good to be with you. And uh we're in this series called uh Rejected, but the

125
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:40.979
series isn't about rejection. It's really about acceptance. It's really about understanding how uh

126
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:50.839
we are accepted the way we are. And how God has something beautiful in store for each of us. But I

127
00:29:50.849 --> 00:30:00.310
know that all of us have experienced rejection and we understand how deliberating this is how it

128
00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:08.010
paralyzes us and, and renders us powerless in so many areas of our life. And as a result, I believe

129
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:14.410
that God can speak into that through the scriptures, but also primarily through the very life of

130
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.449
Jesus. And that's what we're doing in this series is that we're looking at the moments in jesus'

131
00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:27.130
life where he dealt with rejection. And today, we're going to look at a moment in his life where he

132
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:38.180
experienced repeated rejection. And in that repetition of rejection, many of us can look back on our

133
00:30:38.189 --> 00:30:47.010
own life and see how we sometimes have been rejected more than once by the same person, by the same

134
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:55.969
family, by the same employer, by the same circumstances that may have reappeared in our lives.

135
00:30:55.979 --> 00:31:04.270
Although it was through people that we had never met before. But there is nonetheless a repetition.

136
00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:13.800
And in that repetition, it sometimes brings us to a place where we obviously don't feel like we have

137
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:26.099
been seen where we have been honored a place that tells us that we are valued that we are necessary.

138
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:35.979
And when we have experienced these things, it has had an impact on us emotionally relationally, it

139
00:31:35.989 --> 00:31:46.359
has had an impact on us in ways that has made even prevented us from making the most of

140
00:31:46.369 --> 00:31:54.760
opportunities because we were struggling with the rejection that we had faced. And so what I'm gonna

141
00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:00.589
do is I'm gonna read with you a few passages that we're gonna put on the screen and, and these

142
00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:06.739
passages are going to kind of just set the tone for what we're gonna talk about today. And uh these

143
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:15.819
verses just kind of reflect a moment in the story that we're in. But I will expand on that moment

144
00:32:15.829 --> 00:32:23.500
and bring us to some practical applications for our own life. So let's just begin at this key

145
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:34.939
passage that is found in Luke four verse 18 and 19. And this is a moment in which Jesus understands

146
00:32:35.869 --> 00:32:46.859
his purpose. He understands his mission and he has it informed by the scriptures. Obviously, he

147
00:32:46.959 --> 00:32:53.969
declares this in the synagogue in which he's in. And he says in his moment of teaching in his own

148
00:32:53.979 --> 00:33:04.859
hometown of Nazareth, he says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to bring

149
00:33:04.869 --> 00:33:15.880
good news to the poor. And he has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind

150
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:26.660
will see that the oppressed will be set free and that the time of the Lord's favor has come. And

151
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:40.119
then there's a moment in chapter 44 of this story where the people that have heard him say these

152
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:49.739
things and he has taught them what they mean that all of a sudden this is their reaction. And So in

153
00:33:49.750 --> 00:34:00.930
verse 29 look at what it says, jumping up, they mobbed him and they forced him out of the synagogue

154
00:34:01.819 --> 00:34:11.409
to the edge of the hill on which the town was built and they intended to push him over the cliff.

155
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:21.139
But in that moment, Jesus passes right through the crowd and went on his way and he left them all

156
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:31.658
behind. And then in Mark chapter six verses 1 to 4, we see the second instance in which Jesus is

157
00:34:31.668 --> 00:34:42.070
rejected. Jesus left the part of the country and he returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his

158
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:50.110
hometown and the next Sabbath, he began teaching in the synagogue and many who heard him were amazed

159
00:34:50.479 --> 00:35:00.110
and they asked, where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles? And then

160
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:11.120
they scoffed and then they said these words. He's just a carpenter. He's the son of Mary. He's the

161
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:22.989
brother of James, Joseph Judas and Simon and his sisters live right here among us and they were

162
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:33.110
deeply offended and they refused to believe in him. And then Jesus told them these words, a prophet

163
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:45.959
is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family. And

164
00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:53.169
when I, that God would just read would take the reading of his word and take a moment to read our

165
00:35:53.679 --> 00:36:01.739
hearts and thoughts right now and that he would bless it to each of us. So we would have insights

166
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:10.699
today and make realizations today. Like never before I want to ask you this question and I want you

167
00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:19.100
to be honest with the answer. What is the earliest memory of rejection in your life?

168
00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.689
I want you to think back to that moment,

169
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.679
the earliest memory of rejection.

170
00:36:32.949 --> 00:36:38.330
Now, I want you to ask yourself a second part to that question. Now, how has that affected you?

171
00:36:43.209 --> 00:36:50.229
Now, I'm gonna ask you a second question. And now this is about today, what is the most recent

172
00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:53.310
memory of rejection that you have?

173
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.600
And now how is that holding you back?

174
00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:09.639
Now, the reason I'm asking you about this is because I think you understand this, even if you don't

175
00:37:09.649 --> 00:37:15.459
know it scientifically, you know it through experience that our memories are connected to our

176
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:16.209
emotions

177
00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:27.290
and the motions that we connect two are the result of the memories that we keep recalling.

178
00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:35.500
And it has more of a bearing on the choices you make every day than, than you may have realized.

179
00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:45.939
You see every single memory that you have comes with the meaning that you have attached to it.

180
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:56.040
See, it isn't a meaning that someone else has attached to it. It's a meaning that you have given it,

181
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.719
you gave it.

182
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:07.810
And that's why you remember it. Have you ever noticed how two people can hear the same words? They

183
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:16.229
can hear the exact same thing, but they attribute different meanings and importance to it? I have

184
00:38:16.239 --> 00:38:25.689
two brothers. We grew up in the same house and yet we have different memories of the same situations.

185
00:38:27.729 --> 00:38:34.669
We recall things very differently and in fact, they impacted us differently. II, I remember talking

186
00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:42.040
to my youngest brother and talking about an event that my self and my middle brother were laughing

187
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:50.840
about that. My brother to this day still feels deep pain about. We're laughing about it like it was

188
00:38:51.040 --> 00:39:01.149
nothing but it was everything for him. The same memory experienced differently. Do you ever have a

189
00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:11.120
conversation with someone? Um And you say something but they totally understood it differently. It

190
00:39:11.129 --> 00:39:18.679
isn't what you said. It isn't what you meant. It isn't where you were going. You were not looking to

191
00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:21.110
divorce that day, but that's where it's headed.

192
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.790
Has that ever happened to you or am I just talking out of my own marriage?

193
00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:33.469
It happens to me more times than I'd like to admit.

194
00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:41.919
And often it's attached to a memory that my wife has an experience that she's had and, and, and one

195
00:39:41.929 --> 00:39:50.550
that I've given her, no doubt. Uh and, and then other times it has nothing to do with me, but it's

196
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:57.219
almost like I'm the one doing it all over again and, and I need us to understand that this is

197
00:39:57.229 --> 00:40:02.500
something that happens to all of us and, and when this happens without even realizing it, here's

198
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.929
what's happening. We are in the moment living out our deepest rejections

199
00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:16.469
and, and it's affecting us. It's affecting our mental state, our emotional state. It's affecting

200
00:40:16.479 --> 00:40:22.929
current relationships and the possibility of future ones too. See everything that we have gone

201
00:40:22.939 --> 00:40:32.780
through isn't just a memory. It's, it's a moment that if we're not careful can repeat itself and

202
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.300
lead to further rejection.

203
00:40:36.989 --> 00:40:46.110
I, I never realized this until I began to just seek for help, for myself and then for others, but to

204
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:52.620
better understand how to help people overcome what they were going through in their own life. But

205
00:40:52.629 --> 00:40:56.969
the truth of the matter is is that we, we listen through our memories.

206
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:08.189
I, I wish it wasn't true. I, I wish we were more profound than that. I, I wish we were more elevated.

207
00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:16.439
I, I wish we were better at, at how we interact with, with people and how we just like, don't pass

208
00:41:16.449 --> 00:41:24.719
any, any judgment until we have really taken into consideration the motivation with which someone

209
00:41:24.729 --> 00:41:31.000
has spoken. But the truth is is that more often than not, we are just listening through our memories.

210
00:41:32.429 --> 00:41:40.189
Now, I want us to see that we listen also through the lens of the rejection that we've lived. We

211
00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:45.850
listen through the hurt, the abandonment, we listen through the offense and we listen through the

212
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:53.040
betrayal. And, and today, when you listen, even to what I have to say this, it's happening, you know,

213
00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:59.550
something that God wants to do in our life all the time is set us free. But, but here's the problem.

214
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:07.409
The problem is that we have experienced all of these things and, and God is trying to break through

215
00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:13.649
and he's trying to give us our breakthrough. But, but the problem is that there's been so much

216
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:19.300
rejection, so much hurt, so much abandonment, so much offense, so much betrayal that we just can't

217
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:28.020
live out our breakthroughs that he's been willing and ready to give us all up and we're stuck and we

218
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:33.959
find ourselves like not moving forward and not experiencing new things because we just keep

219
00:42:34.149 --> 00:42:37.159
experiencing this repeated rejection.

220
00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:50.830
II, I want us to gasp at this, but I, I also want us to grasp what needs to happen. II, I want us to

221
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:58.010
see ourselves in the Brokenness, but I, I want us to believe in the breakthrough. See you see, God

222
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:05.699
doesn't just wanna highlight what's wrong with us. He, he, he wants to show us how he can make all

223
00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:15.810
things right again. II, I believe that today uh we can revisit rejection but, but this is how we're

224
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:23.919
gonna have to do it. I'm gonna put up these four things in front of you so that you have a clear

225
00:43:24.149 --> 00:43:31.129
pathway and how we are going to overcome rejection. The first thing that we're gonna have to do is

226
00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:37.360
that we're gonna have to revisit the rejection just like we did with our memories. We're gonna have

227
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:42.010
to take a look at where it was that we lived out that rejection

228
00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:50.320
and, and then once we revisit the rejection, we're gonna ask God for insights into that rejection.

229
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:57.810
We're going to ask him to reveal the impact of that. We're gonna ask God to show us what it is that

230
00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:07.500
we've been missing and, and why I find myself having addictive behaviors or why is it that I lash

231
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:13.919
out with such strong anger? Why is it that I can't control my tongue and my emotions? Why is it that

232
00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:24.300
my actions just keep leading me to making similar mistakes? But with new people instead of having

233
00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:34.000
new experiences, I'm repeating old patterns and habits. I need God to not just help me to revisit

234
00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:42.770
the rejection. I need him to reveal the rejection. I need him to show me what I don't see. I don't

235
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:52.419
want more of my interpretation. I need a new understanding and I need that to come from God. See

236
00:44:52.429 --> 00:45:00.020
that can only come when we surrender to God before God and ask God to help us to see what it is that

237
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:07.510
we've been just stuck in the darkness with for so long that it's just become so familiar that we

238
00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.850
don't even know what light looks like anymore.

239
00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:16.520
And then I, I want us to ask God to help us to redefine that rejection.

240
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:26.750
I, I want God to give us a new definition of what that rejection is gonna mean going forward that

241
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.989
even though it's not a good thing and even though there's nothing good in it, it's ok. God is going

242
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:39.610
to show me the good that can come out of this. He's gonna redefine this moment for me, like, like no

243
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:46.530
one else can. And then once he has redefined this moment of rejection, the best part is gonna come

244
00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:54.340
next and it's going to be that it's going to be completely and forever refrained that every time I

245
00:45:54.350 --> 00:46:00.679
think of that rejection is not going to hold me back. But it's going to point to the beautiful

246
00:46:00.689 --> 00:46:02.939
future that I've created in spite of it.

247
00:46:05.419 --> 00:46:10.560
And when we capture this, when we understand these things, I mean, we're gonna be able to take steps

248
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:18.209
like we've never taken before. But, but these things are necessary if we're going to change our

249
00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:25.889
relationship with rejection. Because if we don't change our relationship with rejection, we cannot

250
00:46:25.899 --> 00:46:35.850
change the trajectory of our life. Many of us are not experiencing everything that God has for us

251
00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:43.770
because we have not taken this necessary step because we won't take it because we don't know how to

252
00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:51.989
take it because we just think that these things are always gonna have the control on our lives that

253
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:59.199
they've always had. You know what I've come to realize in my own life. And, and I want you to

254
00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:04.939
realize this to be true in your own. And I hope that that when you hear this next, you, you will

255
00:47:04.949 --> 00:47:12.800
believe in it. As much as I have come to believe it. You don't rise to the level of your dreams and

256
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:13.699
your purpose.

257
00:47:17.129 --> 00:47:20.270
You only fall to the level of what you perceive you are worth

258
00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:28.729
because God has already told you you are worthy.

259
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.500
He's already told you that you are everything to Him.

260
00:47:37.929 --> 00:47:45.560
He has already promised you blessings that no one can give you and no one can take from you. He's

261
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:51.719
already told you that the doors, he opens, no one can close and the doors he closes, no one can open.

262
00:47:53.010 --> 00:48:02.709
He's already told you that He is, you're everything and can give you everything that you need every

263
00:48:02.719 --> 00:48:08.030
day of your life. The problem is we don't live like we believe it.

264
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:16.510
And I know a lot of you today, you have dreams, you have, you have goals, you have aspirations. I, I

265
00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:21.860
know you, I've, I've spoken with many of you and I know what some of them are. You, you, you believe

266
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:27.159
that God has put you on this earth for a purpose that goes beyond the roles and the responsibilities

267
00:48:27.169 --> 00:48:36.020
that you have today. But the problem is that you're held back by another issue and that is the level

268
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:45.189
of your worth. God wants you to understand that, that you are everything to Him, but you need to see

269
00:48:45.379 --> 00:48:48.330
that He can be everything to you

270
00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:55.629
and take you to the places that you could never get to on your own.

271
00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:04.189
And so here is what I've come to understand and I pray that this speaks to you as well.

272
00:49:06.419 --> 00:49:16.689
When people give you a no and they reject you, I want you to let God give you his knowing. Instead,

273
00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:25.060
when people say no, you turn to what God knows.

274
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:36.429
And I'm telling you that if you can make this shift, it doesn't matter how many times people say no,

275
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.780
it only matters what God knows.

276
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:49.580
And if you put faith in people, you will get a lot of nos, you will get a lot of rejection just like

277
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.239
Jesus did

278
00:49:53.659 --> 00:50:03.469
and we're not him and we didn't have his skill and we didn't have his power and we didn't accomplish

279
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:13.629
even a measure of what he did. And yet people still rejected him. His own people said no. But what

280
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:15.620
mattered to Jesus is what God knew.

281
00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:25.739
And that's so key and it's so important for each of us. You know, when people come in and out of

282
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:33.270
your life, we sometimes wonder, you know, what is it that I could have done differently? Iib that,

283
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.879
you know, I said, I don't know what more I could have done. And sometimes I, I know I didn't do

284
00:50:37.889 --> 00:50:44.500
enough, right? Like we just recognize it, but sometimes you just know you did everything like

285
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:49.540
there's not more that you could have done. There's no more you could have given, there's no more you

286
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:56.020
could have sacrificed. There's no more that you could have in that moment just been better. You just

287
00:50:56.629 --> 00:51:07.750
were who you were limited for sure, with flaws, no doubt. But you did everything that you could. I

288
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:14.330
have come to understand that sometimes your value is just hidden to others

289
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.679
and it's because they are not assigned to your destiny.

290
00:51:26.479 --> 00:51:33.639
And what God is trying to do is he's trying to release you from people and from persons and from a

291
00:51:33.649 --> 00:51:34.169
person

292
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:43.780
that is not going to value you and be a part of the future that He is giving you.

293
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:54.810
But how is it that all of these people who know Jesus can't see who Jesus is? How is it that the

294
00:51:54.820 --> 00:52:02.090
scriptures talk about how he had performed miracles. But then they just still couldn't see him for

295
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:09.590
who he was describing through the book of Isaiah in the prophecy that had been given regarding the

296
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:15.949
Messiah who would come and now the messiah was in their midst and he was doing all the things that

297
00:52:15.959 --> 00:52:24.270
were written. And in that day that Jesus said, hey, guess what? Today these words are fulfilled in

298
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.610
your midst. They all made the decision to throw them off a cliff.

299
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:38.000
And you look at that and you say, how, how is this possible? I'll tell you how because sometimes

300
00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:45.889
even people who love God are used by the devil to kill you and your dreams

301
00:52:52.429 --> 00:52:57.530
because God wants you to succeed. But Satan wants to make sure you never do.

302
00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:07.300
And sometimes he will use the people in the synagogue, in the church, in the spiritual realms to

303
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:11.739
come against you to make sure that you and your dreams never make it.

304
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:16.909
And, and if they did it to Jesus, don't think they're not gonna come for you.

305
00:53:23.469 --> 00:53:29.820
But I love what Jesus does. And to me, this is like so key for all of us because this is now we're,

306
00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:39.070
we're gonna get down to what he he did, right? So that we can apply this in our own life. The first

307
00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:45.229
thing is that Jesus lived his purpose from the scriptures and not from the synagogue.

308
00:53:49.040 --> 00:54:00.000
You see when he opens up the scriptures, he let that define his life and it didn't matter what was

309
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:04.590
gonna happen in the synagogue. It doesn't matter what they're about to do next. It doesn't matter

310
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:12.379
what they want to do with him. They cannot have any power or authority over him because Jesus is

311
00:54:12.389 --> 00:54:14.979
gonna walk right through them.

312
00:54:17.139 --> 00:54:29.860
He is unstoppable because the scriptures make you unstoppable. It gives you power and authority, it

313
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:39.520
gives you the ability that you could not have on your own. How can a mob that is intent on murder

314
00:54:40.659 --> 00:54:48.560
and that is blocking every exit and had the power to remove you from the synagogue and bring you to

315
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:57.229
the cliff. How do they not have the power to now throw you off of it? It is because the scriptures

316
00:54:57.239 --> 00:55:02.689
give you the power to walk through the crowd of rejection.

317
00:55:06.989 --> 00:55:14.659
And God wants to give you through the scriptures, a new understanding of your rejection. He wants to

318
00:55:14.669 --> 00:55:20.840
give you new insights and understanding into that rejection so that whatever the crowd has wanted to

319
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:26.040
do and throwing you off of the cliff, killing you and your dreams, they can't do it because you're

320
00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:31.659
just going to have the scriptures that are gonna lead you through that crowd of rejection and give

321
00:55:31.669 --> 00:55:34.219
you the full acceptance that you need in your life.

322
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:39.149
Look, I, we can all work on ourselves.

323
00:55:41.709 --> 00:55:51.719
I, I'm still working on myself some days. It's going really good sometimes not. I'm gonna be honest.

324
00:55:53.129 --> 00:56:02.500
I, I can't be the only person who, who knows what it's like to relapse anybody else relapse into old

325
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:11.159
ways, old patterns, you know, just living up to old rejections. II, I know that this is true for all

326
00:56:11.169 --> 00:56:18.280
of us. But I, I want us to, to see what Jesus does next. You see Jesus did something that, that

327
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:25.830
everybody had their eyes fixated on him. They saw something in him that was different, it was on him

328
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:33.100
in a way that was so powerful that no one could deny what it was. Every eye was on Jesus, but it

329
00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:41.300
also stirred up the devil in such a powerful way that they wanted to jump up and just kill him. In

330
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:48.729
that moment. The Bible tells us that Jesus lived his purpose by being filled with the Holy Spirit,

331
00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:50.610
instead of people's doubts.

332
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:59.219
You see, when you're filled with the Holy Spirit, it means this, it means, it means that you are not

333
00:56:59.229 --> 00:57:08.500
just doing this with your understanding, you're doing it with his presence. And what you're asking

334
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:14.879
is you're asking Jesus to increase in your life. You're asking for him to fill up more of the gaps

335
00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:21.100
in the spaces in your mind and in your heart and in your life, you're asking Jesus to become more

336
00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:25.989
and more and you becoming less and less. And you'll see that the changes that you're looking for

337
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.620
aren't gonna happen just because you know what needs to change. It's gonna happen through the power

338
00:57:30.629 --> 00:57:37.110
that brings about that change because the power comes through his presence, the presence is the

339
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:46.040
power and you cannot walk through rejection nor can you avoid doubts and the limitations that you

340
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:53.639
have put on yourself or that others are placing on you. If you were not filled with the spirit. See,

341
00:57:53.649 --> 00:58:01.129
Jesus didn't just read the Scriptures. The Bible says that he was filled with the Holy Spirit. He

342
00:58:01.139 --> 00:58:10.050
was filled to such a degree that he was able to not be worried about the doubts that people had the

343
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:15.280
rejection that they were offering him. You don't think it was painful for him to be rejected by his

344
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:26.159
own family, by the religious leaders that he grew up listening to and being a part of the Bible says

345
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:33.219
that he had performed miracles in their midst and yet even those miracles were not enough. And he

346
00:58:33.229 --> 00:58:40.100
must have said those things just like you say those things. What more must I do? What more must I be?

347
00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:46.629
If these people don't know me, then who knows me? You know, when the people that are closest to you,

348
00:58:46.639 --> 00:58:51.979
the people that you grew up with, the people who you would expect for them to understand you better

349
00:58:51.989 --> 00:58:59.320
than everyone else rejects you. There is no pain that is greater and Jesus lived that. But you know

350
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:06.129
what helped him overcome that he was filled with the Holy Spirit. He was filled with the scriptures.

351
00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.919
And the Bible says that there was one more thing

352
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:13.330
that he was able to do.

353
00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:25.260
You see Jesus lived his purpose by moving past dream killers and not returning to places of unbelief.

354
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:33.969
See, there comes a moment in all of our lives where you have to sometimes physically and literally

355
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:38.969
leave people and places behind. Listen to me.

356
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:46.669
Some of you say pass, I did that a long time ago. That's the one thing I'm really good at leaving

357
00:59:46.679 --> 00:59:52.510
people in places. Well, you only got one out of the three. So that's OK. There's some work to be

358
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.350
done. The first two are just as important. That's why this one's last because you will never know

359
00:59:57.669 --> 01:00:02.770
who are the people and the places to leave. If you are not filled with scripture and filled with his

360
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:10.459
presence. You see people make mistakes leaving people in places because the first two things aren't

361
01:00:10.469 --> 01:00:17.179
there, then they look back and then they say, why did I do that? Why did I say that? Why did I move

362
01:00:17.189 --> 01:00:23.300
past that? Why am I still not able to move past? I'll tell you why because the first two things that

363
01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:29.689
were missing, see Jesus is able to do the third thing because the first two things were already

364
01:00:29.699 --> 01:00:30.080
there.

365
01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:37.219
So I always tell people before you move on from people and places you really need to be filled up

366
01:00:37.229 --> 01:00:40.719
with the scriptures and make sure that you're not doing something that God already told you you

367
01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:41.280
can't do

368
01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:48.310
and do it in a way that He's already told you is not good for you or anyone else.

369
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.580
I know you're filled with hurt. I know you're filled with disappointment. I know you're filled with

370
01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:04.979
anguish and with pain and tragedy and trauma. You could be filled with a lot of things, resentment,

371
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:10.399
envy, and jealousy and pride. You could be filled with such anger and frustration and you are filled

372
01:01:10.409 --> 01:01:15.959
with rejection. But God is saying, but I need you to be filled with the Holy Spirit. And if you're

373
01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:21.270
not filled with the Holy Spirit, then how do you know that you're doing the right thing when it

374
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.149
comes to leaving people in places,

375
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.040
not everyone who is in your life is a dream killer. And not everyone in your life is there to throw

376
01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:38.290
you off a cliff. Not everyone that is in your life is there to make sure that you don't fulfill your

377
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:46.830
purpose. But God will show you if they are and if they are, you can move through that crowd in Jesus

378
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:55.050
name in the way that he parts the water. You are going to be able to part people. You're gonna be

379
01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:01.270
able to leave that rejection behind. It will not have a hold on you. It will not have any power over

380
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:07.239
you. It will not limit you. It will not keep you from living your best life. Can you say amen to

381
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:16.209
that? You see God is going to do that for you, but he's showing us how he's going to do it. He's

382
01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:20.969
telling us what it's going to look like. So every time

383
01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.010
Jesus was put in a position

384
01:02:27.629 --> 01:02:36.500
to move past his dream killers, he did. Every time he was put in a position to not return to places

385
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:43.429
of unbelief, He did it. He said I'm never going to go back to Nazareth and guess what? He never

386
01:02:43.439 --> 01:02:43.709
did.

387
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:52.290
He never did. He spent the rest of his ministry preaching everywhere else but there.

388
01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:04.270
So what did Jesus do with all that? He kept living his purpose and he didn't let rejection hold him

389
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:10.169
back. See, it didn't matter, it didn't matter that they tried to kill him. It didn't matter, they

390
01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:13.729
had rejected him. It didn't matter, they weren't supportive. It didn't matter that they had doubts,

391
01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:20.639
it didn't matter that they wanted him to still be a carpenter. You just saying, listen, you want me

392
01:03:20.649 --> 01:03:24.449
to be a carpenter. But here's the problem with that. That was just my day job.

393
01:03:27.719 --> 01:03:34.250
That, that was just the way I ended up living until I could become the messiah. See, that's what I

394
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:43.820
had to do to walk towards my true purpose. And now, and now I'm gonna do this full time. Anybody

395
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:48.439
else wanna leave what they're, where they're at doing what they're doing for the new thing that God

396
01:03:48.449 --> 01:04:02.489
has in store for them. OK? Come on, man. Come on. Are you gonna rise to the level of God's worth?

397
01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:07.149
Are you gonna stay at the level of yours?

398
01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:17.620
God is saying rise to mine. It's much better. I got so much more for you. This is not about how you

399
01:04:17.629 --> 01:04:23.929
see yourself. This is how I see you and you need to start seeing how I see you and start living like

400
01:04:23.939 --> 01:04:35.100
that too. II I look at this and I say God, I mean, every time Jesus was rejected, he was redirected

401
01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:41.330
to the acceptance of his heavenly Father. And I need you to do the same thing. Every time you

402
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:47.989
experience rejection in your life, I want you to think it's ok because I am accepted by my heavenly

403
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.280
father. And He holds the key to my future. It doesn't matter what people do. It doesn't matter what

404
01:04:56.290 --> 01:05:03.040
dreams they come after. It doesn't even matter if they come after me because they cannot stop God

405
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:12.260
from blessing me and from doing what He wants to do in my life. Unless I let them, you see, we can't

406
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:18.610
let people throw us off the cliff when we are meant to walk through them.

407
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.739
God is saying you don't have to be thrown off the cliff. You don't have to live that moment of

408
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:37.320
rejection. I'm giving you the power to walk through it to leave them behind and experience the best

409
01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:44.229
that God has to offer. Are you ready to receive that? Are you ready to receive that in your life?

410
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:54.389
I'm gonna ask that at the end of this gathering that if you've been struggling with rejection and

411
01:05:54.399 --> 01:05:59.459
you know that it's been holding you back, we're going to do something today that I'm gonna ask you

412
01:05:59.469 --> 01:06:02.199
to just step out in faith.

413
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:11.179
I'm gonna ask that you would just consider where you are, where you've been and where God wants you

414
01:06:11.189 --> 01:06:20.310
to be. And I want you to take a step forward today and, and I want to be able to pray over you. And

415
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:28.969
I want to pray personally for God to help you to walk through and pass that rejection and leave it

416
01:06:28.979 --> 01:06:39.000
behind once and for all, I, I wanna believe with you that today that God is gonna do something

417
01:06:39.199 --> 01:06:46.739
incredibly powerful in your life that this is gonna be a significant moment for you.

418
01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:55.159
And so we're going to sing a song right now and the song is called Not a Freight. And I know that

419
01:06:55.169 --> 01:07:02.510
right now, everybody is a little afraid of what I just said. So I knew that. And so we're going to

420
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.909
sing this song to help us with a little bit of courage and, and, and I need you to see that when we

421
01:07:08.919 --> 01:07:15.239
sing songs, what we're doing is that we're inviting the presence of the Holy Spirit to come into our

422
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:20.989
lives. You believe that? And so here's what's going to happen while the song is playing

423
01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:30.729
and they're singing, I'm not afraid I want you to come to the front

424
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:44.729
and I wanna pray over you individually with our prayer team that is here with our overseers and, and

425
01:07:44.739 --> 01:07:51.360
II, I promise you that, that God today is gonna give you your breakthrough

426
01:07:53.860 --> 01:08:01.270
if you come expecting it, believing in it and trusting in it. Here's what happens. God meets that

427
01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:01.850
belief.

428
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.100
It, it, it's not gonna be about what I pray

429
01:08:09.379 --> 01:08:18.240
as much as it's going to be about your faith. And so when you come to the front, here's what I want

430
01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:29.660
you to picture the crowd of rejection that you are going to walk past. Amen. Yeah, the rejection

431
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:31.399
that you are going to leave behind

432
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:45.810
and the acceptance that God is going to give you and the power of purpose to live the life that he's

433
01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:46.930
always wanted to give you.

434
01:08:49.099 --> 01:08:55.770
And God is ready to heal you from your past, as much as he's ready to create a new future. But it's

435
01:08:55.779 --> 01:09:04.930
gonna take this moment. So I'm gonna ask you to just stand, ok, just stand with me and let's just

436
01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:12.419
start to sing this song together. OK? And, and as soon as you're ready, you just come and we're

437
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:18.279

and prayer team just come to the front and uh help me to start praying for people.

505
01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:07.950
We are a church that leaves offenses behind. Amen. We don't live by the power of offense. We

506
01:20:07.959 --> 01:20:13.540
live by the power of the Holy Spirit. And so we're gonna, we're just gonna do things the way we do

507
01:20:13.549 --> 01:20:18.490
them. OK? And be cool, be chill, you know, just enjoy each other's company and we're gonna keep
