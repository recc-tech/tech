00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:14.480
Well, welcome to Rivers Edge. We're so glad that you're here. Would you stand with us as we would

2
00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:19.369
just open this gathering? And we thank you for being here and being on time. And as we enter into

3
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.829
our summer months, we're preparing for the fall and for the great things that God has in store for

4
00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:28.769
us. And today we have a wonderful gathering as we continue this series called Getting There. And

5
00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:36.200
today we're going to be talking about the topic of Anger through the title, which is Strike Your Way

6
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:41.359
to Wonder. And I know that God has something powerful in store for us. We also want to remind all

7
00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:47.599
the parents here today, both for our kids and youth that our program starts at 10 30 for the youth,

8
00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:53.799
it starts at 10 a.m. and we're glad that you have brought them with you today. We want to welcome

9
00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:59.630
our River's Edge worship team as they would lead us into a time of putting the attention where it

10
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.849
rightfully belongs most of the week. The attention is on us. It's on our thoughts, it's on our

11
00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:12.039
distractions, it's on our doubts, it's on what we may even imagine it our disasters. But when we

12
00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:17.280
come into the presence of God, what we get to do is we get to change all that. We get to turn our

13
00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:25.440
attention on Him. Be grateful, be thankful, be appreciative, but more importantly, believe in the

14
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:30.799
miraculous. And today is a day in which we can come before God and look at the things that are not

15
00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:37.429
right and believe in a God who can make all things right again. And if there's anything that may

16
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:44.440
have died in our lives or things that we feel are close to it, we believe in the power of a God who

17
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:52.840
can rise things and raise things from the dead and he is risen today and that's who we are

18
00:09:52.849 --> 00:09:59.289
worshiping. We're worshiping a risen Lord and anything that we need in our lives today, Jesus can do

19
00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:04.520
it if we just turn our attention and our faith to him. And so let's just pray, father, thank you for

20
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:10.190
every person that is here today. And what we want, Lord is for them to have an encounter with you,

21
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.049
not with us. This is about you and it's about what you can offer them and not what we are able to

22
00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:21.270
offer, but what you have given us. Lord, we ask that you would bless and multiply that, that you

23
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.159
would make it a blessing to those that are here to receive it. And that today would be a day where

24
00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:32.659
they get to encounter you and be transformed by you. We sing these songs, Lord to be reminded of

25
00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:38.969
those miracles, to be strengthened in our faith and to be encouraged in our discouragement. And I

26
00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:44.489
pray that today would be a day in which we would sing them. And as we would do that, we would

27
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:50.489
believe in the miraculous. Again, I pray that you would direct our attention to the things that you

28
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.299
want us to focus on. You have a specific message for each of us. And today is going to be a day in

29
00:10:57.309 --> 00:11:03.239
which you are going to speak to each of us individually. Thank you that you don't just see us as a

30
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:09.099
group here, but you see us for who we are, you know us by name, you know our needs and you're gonna

31
00:11:09.109 --> 00:11:16.179
meet them today in jesus' name. We pray. Amen. Amen. You guys are excited. You ready for this? Come

32
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:24.380

33
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:31.320

34
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.799
what pastor Z was saying, Jesus is our everlasting light. Let's tie this scene.

35
00:11:51.869 --> 00:12:00.640
You are the horizon, the pride, the glimmer that breaks the did

36
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.590

It's beautiful.

All right, that was so beautiful, wasn't it?

81
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.390
Sometimes it's nice when the drummer's on vacation, you know,

82
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:46.790
it's just a different vibe, you know, and I just want to share some quick announcements uh with you.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:54.219
The first is with um our youth. So we meet at 10 a.m. every Sunday and it's right here in the annex

84
00:26:54.229 --> 00:27:02.130
which during the week is our day care. And so we want to encourage all youth to be here every Sunday

decided we were gonna start uh immediately as the kids were brought in. And then we have members of

92
00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:55.900

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:02.800
blessing for our teachers, our kids just for our parents. And we just want to just give it up for

94

00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:14.260
want to encourage you guys for that. We also have four ways that you can give and they're up here on

115
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.170
the screen. Thank you for your generosity. Um Even if you're not here, you can always give through

116
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:24.280
one of the apps that we use, whether it's Canada helps or, and E transfer is the best because um

117
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:29.530
they don't keep any of the donation that you're giving us and then we have an after party at the end

118
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.859
as well. So you guys can just hang out at the after party at the cafe, um have some cold drinks and

119
00:30:35.869 --> 00:30:41.099
we're just so glad that you're here today. Well, we're going to transition to the message today and

120
00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:42.979
we're going to do that right now right after this bumper.

121
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:38.359
Thank you. So this day is a day in which we're gonna be talking about anger and who can't relate to

122
00:31:38.369 --> 00:31:46.949
that, who is here in this room who at some point um just hasn't lost their temper and it's something

123
00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:53.949
that is actually something that is um quite real in the life of Moses and Moses. We respect him and

124
00:31:53.959 --> 00:32:00.349
know him to be an incredible person and prophet and miracle worker, someone who in spite of his

125
00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:08.810
flaws and faults. God used powerfully and mightily and he's revered still to this day by many as the

126
00:32:08.819 --> 00:32:16.069
greatest prophet of all time. And Moses is someone that yet had an anger problem. We saw that when

127
00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:23.829
he was still under Pharaoh's house and he took the life of, of an Egyptian garden and he buried him

128
00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:31.180
in the sand. And 40 years later, God would call him to come back to the very place where he had hid

129
00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:37.630
his secret to face justice. But more importantly, to deliver a people who had been crying out for

130
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:45.040
justice. And yet in all of those moments, we see that as Moses was called to be a deliverer, he led

131
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.989
them through the desert. And at a certain point when the people became discouraged and they couldn't

132
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.790
understand why Moses had not returned from the mountain top. When Moses saw that they had taken all

133
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:02.000
of their jewelry and gold and silver and had formed a golden calf and done by the hand of his right

134
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:09.739
hand, Aaron, his brother, uh Moses in his anger, took the tablets and he threw them on the ground

135
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:19.119
and broke them. And these were expressions of Moses's anger. They weren't things that were ordained

136
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:28.739
by God. They were just the flaws of moses' life being revealed in front of thousands upon thousands

137
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:36.699
and now millions upon millions of people. Sometimes our can be hidden and other times it's brought

138
00:33:36.709 --> 00:33:43.530
out into the open, sometimes we get anger in private and there are moments where we get angry and

139
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:50.319
it's very public. Sometimes we get angry at home and sometimes we get angry in the workplace.

140
00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:55.699
Sometimes that anger is directed towards ourselves. And other times it's directed to someone who is

141
00:33:55.709 --> 00:34:02.099
undeserving of it. There are many moments in which when we look at ourselves, we can see many

142
00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:09.080
reasons why, well, God shouldn't love us, respect us, why he shouldn't uphold us. And he shouldn't

143
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:18.320
be the one who somehow looks at us as being individuals who are worthy of carrying his name. And yet

144
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:23.000
over and over again, what God does is that He reveals that even in our moments of our greatest

145
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:28.100
weaknesses, God is still faithful to reveal his greatest wonders.

146
00:34:30.439 --> 00:34:38.010
And it, it, it astonishes me that my weakness doesn't prohibit the wonder of God II. I would think

147
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.780
that it would be that way that my weakness would always hold back. God's wonder. But it doesn't, in

148
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:49.520
fact over and over again. It, it never does even for people who I think, ok, this is where it turns

149
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:56.879
wrong. Uh This is where God really lets them have it. And yet somehow his wonder still comes through.

150
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:04.610
And there's a story that is found in Exodus in chapter 17, I want to read it to you and it's the

151
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:09.500
story of the Israelites and they're in this land in between. They have left Egypt, but they're

152
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:17.179
making their way to Canaan, and Canaan is now going to become Israel, it will become the promised land and

153
00:35:17.189 --> 00:35:24.060
they're in this land in between this desert life experience. And, and I believe that many of us find

154
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:29.560
ourselves in this desert experience. I think that many of us feel like we're in some form of

155
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:38.739
transition where we don't like being in the desert. But the desert, the desert has a specific role.

156
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:46.959
A a and God intended his people to, to be in the desert so that they would not just see His wonder,

157
00:35:46.969 --> 00:35:54.040
but that His people would also grow in, in their faith. But, but sometimes what happens is that we,

158
00:35:54.050 --> 00:36:03.090
we just want to see the wonder and not grow in our faith. And so the desert is, is very important,

159
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:10.370
the transitions in which we're in, they're key, they're vital to us experiencing the wonder and we

160
00:36:10.379 --> 00:36:19.159
cannot have disdain for the desert. We cannot be discouraged for the time that we spend in the

161
00:36:19.169 --> 00:36:28.649
desert. We, we have to delight in the desert because the desert is where our faith is being shaped

162
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:36.989
so that God can reveal even greater wonders. And so in Exodus chapter 17, I want us to read this

163
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.010
verse, it's found in verse six and, and God tells the people uh to stand before the rock and then

164
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:50.959
God says, I'm gonna stand with you and I'm going to stand before this rock. And I'm going to tell

165
00:36:50.969 --> 00:36:56.719
you Moses that when you strike this rock and when you strike it on Mount Sinai, I want you to strike

166
00:36:56.729 --> 00:37:01.139
the rock and here's what's going to happen, water is going to come gushing out and then the people

167
00:37:01.149 --> 00:37:08.760
will be able to drink. And so Moses does what he's told. He takes his staff and he strikes the rock.

168
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:16.929
He, he does as he's told. And, and then what happens is that the wonder occurs and, and so Moses

169
00:37:16.939 --> 00:37:26.830
obeys the way that God tells him to. He follows his instructions and then the water gushes out and,

170
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.919
and, and it's important that everybody is present and it's important that the elders are also

171
00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:36.629
looking on because this isn't just a moment for Moses. It's a moment, a moment for all the people

172
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:45.820
you see when God, when God encourages your faith, he wants to encourage the faith of others. At the

173
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:53.860
same time, you see his miracles are, are, are meant to be public so that others can also be in the

174
00:37:53.870 --> 00:38:04.090
same wonder. And, and though they are not the ones who are participating like Moses is, they are

175
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.909
benefiting from it.

176
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:17.070
And, and it's not just for Moses, it's for everyone that is present. And when I look at the

177
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:23.600
scriptures sometimes I think, well, this was a great moment and it was a wonderful moment of wonder,

178
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:32.110
but for other people. But where's my moment of wonder, God, where's, where's my moment of the

179
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:39.409
miraculous and what God does is that He reminds us of stories like this so that when we feel like we

180
00:38:39.419 --> 00:38:45.370
don't have wonder because of the miraculous, we can turn back to the scriptures and say God,

181
00:38:45.379 --> 00:38:53.479
remember that time you told Moses to stand before the rock and strike it. And when he did the water

182
00:38:53.489 --> 00:39:03.139
gushed out Lord in my season of arid of dryness in my season of famine in the moment of my life,

183
00:39:03.149 --> 00:39:13.070
when I am so thirsty, when I cannot be quenched by the things of this life, when everyone and

184
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:23.129
everything is failing me, will you strike the rock and will that water gush out for me just like you

185
00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:33.989
did for your people long ago, you see, you can cry out like that. You can put God to the test just

186
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.370
like that and, and you don't have to fall into crisis and you don't have to fall into a moment where

187
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:48.199
you're just complaining and, and, and, and where you feel like no one cares about you. You see, you

188
00:39:48.209 --> 00:39:54.750
can call on a moment in the scriptures, even if that moment was not your own. It is the faithfulness

189
00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:02.669
of God that has been written and has been pronounced and is being declared over your life right now.

190
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:13.510
That miracle and that wonder is yours to see. Often we have this expression of being between a rock

191
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:22.169
and a hard place. It seems like we're just being squeezed and, and oppressed. And I know that many

192
00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:30.080
of us in this room have experienced various forms of oppression. Sometimes we can feel oppressed

193
00:40:32.729 --> 00:40:43.250
by what is our choice in our choosing. Sometimes we can be oppressed by the darkness that lives so

194
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.889
predominantly in the life of another person. And we're doing life with them and everything that is

195
00:40:48.899 --> 00:40:50.239
wrong in them

196
00:40:52.469 --> 00:41:01.360
is making everything in our life wrong too. Sometimes what we're going through when we say we're

197
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:07.020
between a rock and a hard place, it means that there's no way out for us. There's no relief. It

198
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:12.590
means there's no victory. There's no way this ends. Well, there's no way that we can experience the

199
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:19.500
miraculous and no wonder I it's, it's, it's amazing that in the moment that we're in and we see

200
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:25.030
Moses standing before the rock and he strikes it. There was a moment just prior to that where the

201
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:32.419
people were crying out for Moses's death. You imagine the only one who could actually perform the

202
00:41:32.429 --> 00:41:35.939
miraculous. Everyone just wanted to see

203
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:45.689
the Bible says that they were all ready to stone him. And when Moses goes before God, he says,

204
00:41:45.699 --> 00:41:48.320
you see, you see your people that have let out.

205
00:41:50.469 --> 00:41:54.280
He goes, they're blaming me because we have no water.

206
00:41:57.459 --> 00:42:04.719
And it's interesting that that while they're picking up stones ready to kill Moses, God is gonna

207
00:42:04.729 --> 00:42:07.729
make water come from the stone.

208
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:18.870
And I just think about all the ways that I that I try to kill my faith or I try to kill my

209
00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:28.040
opportunity for the miraculous or try to kill my chance at wonder all the ways that through my

210
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:34.159
complaining and living in crisis and, and my belief that I'm in the desert and there's no way that

211
00:42:34.169 --> 00:42:41.179
I'm getting out of this. And my negativity is choking out the possibility that God can do something

212
00:42:41.189 --> 00:42:47.370
and all along, I'm there angry and I'm holding my stone and I don't want to just throw it at Moses

213
00:42:47.379 --> 00:42:53.840
and end his life. I want to throw it at God and end his. So I don't have to deal with him anymore.

214
00:42:56.889 --> 00:43:04.949
Oh Man, iii, I can speak profoundly on this because I've, I've been there. I, I've been there so

215
00:43:04.959 --> 00:43:14.300
many times where I stood before God and I just wanted to stone him to death because of the moment

216
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.600
that I was in anybody else.

217
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.300
Um

218
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:33.280
And so in a moment in which the people can strike Moses, God saves Moses and he tells Moses to

219
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.540
strike the rock instead.

220
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:46.280
And, and all of a sudden we see this disobedient, very stubborn personality of Moses. That's really

221
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:54.169
who he is. Like we see that not just when he was in Egypt and under, but we see that at the burning

222
00:43:54.179 --> 00:43:59.830
bush. Look at how hard it was for God to convince him to just step out and do what he was telling

223
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:06.959
him to do. You see that stubbornness that rebelliousness that was in is in Moses was, was still with

224
00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:14.469
him. Even at this point, it, it, it doesn't ever fully go away. Iii I wish, I wish it did for all of

225
00:44:14.479 --> 00:44:20.169
us like that. We would never have to worry about it again. But here's the thing, once God has

226
00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:27.669
allowed Satan to show and to reveal that which is wrong and broken in us, that's our moment to say

227
00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:33.330
God take my weakness and let it become your strength so that it doesn't destroy me.

228
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:40.770
And, and there's something about Moses that he hasn't done this yet in his own life. And so he's,

229
00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:47.149
he's going from a place of obedience now from his stubbornness. And normally you would imagine that

230
00:44:47.159 --> 00:44:51.989
he would be resistant to what God would say. But in this moment, he fully obeys and he does exactly

231
00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:57.780
what he's told and he strikes the rock and water comes from it. And, and this is important why?

232
00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:04.979
Because God wants to show all of the people that life will always spring forth from death when God

233
00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:15.129
speaks his word. And III, I look at the rock that may be my life, my heart. Oh, I look at the rock

234
00:45:15.139 --> 00:45:23.929
that may be in my hand or, or, or maybe that, that is just in my way like an obstacle, like like an

235
00:45:23.939 --> 00:45:26.090
unsurmountable

236
00:45:28.939 --> 00:45:39.709
challenge in my life. And I say, God can, can you make life spring forth from this? And then my

237
00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:48.199
answer needs to be yes, because you've done it before. And Lord, I will not look at this rock the

238
00:45:48.209 --> 00:45:55.929
same way. I will not believe in you the way that I have in the past. I will not think of my

239
00:45:55.939 --> 00:46:03.050
relationship with you as, as something that cannot have life that feels like death. But instead, I

240
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:12.439
will believe that I can move from doubt and fear to a place of trust and faith. And I believe that

241
00:46:12.449 --> 00:46:19.199
God is doing that for us every day. But, but we're sometimes just missing out on it. I, I believe

242
00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:25.199
that he's showing us these things, but we can miss out on it just like the Israelites did. You know

243
00:46:25.209 --> 00:46:31.020
they were missing out on the lessons and because they were missing out on the lessons, even though

244
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:39.760
there were miracles and wonders, they were still wandering. I don't want that to be us. I don't want

245
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:52.280
that to be you where God who performs the miracle and reveals His wonder wants to stop us from

246
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:59.199
wandering aimlessly in this life. And instead wants us to get to the destination that He has in

247
00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:00.100
store for us.

248
00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:09.669
And God is saying, I want to move you from a life threatening situation to one that is life giving.

249
00:47:10.879 --> 00:47:15.100
And I, I don't know what your situation is right now, but I'm sure that there's something in front

250
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:21.610
of you that is telling you that this is life threatening. III I don't, I, I can't imagine that you

251
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:27.500
are here and, and you don't feel some of that, that you don't see some of that in your life. You

252
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:34.750
know, maybe you're, you're, you're one paycheck away from disaster. Maybe you're one medical exam

253
00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:43.689
away from bad news. Maybe you're just holding on to whatever sanity is left as you are just pushed

254
00:47:43.699 --> 00:47:51.580
to the limits by your Children or, or, or just from the emptiness of maybe not having them. There

255
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:58.179
are so many things that can come into our lives that can can push us to the place where we feel that

256
00:47:58.189 --> 00:48:05.370
our life, the way that we envision and imagine our life should be and should have been. It is just

257
00:48:05.379 --> 00:48:12.399
been threatened. But what God says is that in this moment of being in the desert, the harsh

258
00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:19.060
conditions of the desert, these are the moments where I want to prove to you that I still love you

259
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:26.139
that I am still faithful to you that I can move you from miracle to miracle to wonder, to wonder you.

260
00:48:26.149 --> 00:48:33.389
See, I'm going to use this season of your life not to show how you are forsaken, but how instead you

261
00:48:33.399 --> 00:48:43.760
are forever mine. See, God is saying the transitions are intended to train and transform us. If we

262
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:52.120
will let them do that, otherwise you will keep wandering and, and the God who wants to get us there,

263
00:48:53.429 --> 00:48:57.840
we're going to be stuck in this thing. Where we'll just keep telling ourselves well, I'm getting

264
00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:02.709
there and the years just keep slipping by

265
00:49:07.689 --> 00:49:11.540
and we'll look at those years and we'll say, well, my life could have turned out different, but

266
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:18.939
here's, and here's where, here's where we failed. We didn't allow for it to train and transform us.

267
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.689
And so I want to tell you the story as it continues because you would think this would be the one

268
00:49:25.699 --> 00:49:31.530
time where we'd be able to just look at this and say, well, Moses learned, you know, the people

269
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:37.610
understood uh they're not holding stones in their hands anymore. They're not seeing God as just one

270
00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.889
big angry stone ready to roll over them.

271
00:49:43.189 --> 00:49:51.199
But in numbers chapter 20 take a look at verse eight to verse 11, it says, take the staff that you

272
00:49:51.209 --> 00:49:58.889
and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together and then he says, I want you to speak to that

273
00:49:58.899 --> 00:50:04.409
rock before their eyes and it's going to pour out its water. It's very important that we pay

274
00:50:04.419 --> 00:50:15.010
attention to the fact that he says, speak because in the first passage that we read, he was told to

275
00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.290
strike. But now he's being told to speak.

276
00:50:21.689 --> 00:50:28.179
And then it says, you're going to bring water out of the rock for the community so that they and

277
00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:32.649
their livestock can drink. And so Moses took the slap, the staff that was from the Lord's presence

278
00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:38.989
just as he had commanded him. And, and then Aaron and Moses gathered the assembly together in front

279
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.290
of the rock and Moses said to them, listen, you rebels. I was like, how he calls them that you could

280
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.209
tell he's had enough. Right?

281
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.219
Yeah, it's not very uplifting to call someone a rebel. If you want them to stop rebelling, it's not,

282
00:50:54.229 --> 00:50:59.080
it's not usually what you do to try to, you know, coach someone up to, you know, to reaching a new

283
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:03.889
level and new standard. You know, if you want them to understand, you know, who they're supposed to

284
00:51:03.899 --> 00:51:12.629
be in God, but he's just like, clearly had enough and doesn't care. And he says, we must do this. So

285
00:51:12.639 --> 00:51:18.689
I'm gonna tell you what God has said and he said, we're gonna bring you water out of this rock. And

286
00:51:18.699 --> 00:51:26.129
then Moses raised his arm and then look at this, he struck the rock twice with his staff and water

287
00:51:26.139 --> 00:51:33.260
gushed out and the community and their livestock drank. And so Moses does the wrong thing. He

288
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:39.219
doesn't follow what God has said. God told him to speak. And Moses didn't, he struck the rock

289
00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:44.060
instead and he didn't just strike it once. He struck it twice. And you can tell when he calls them

290
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:51.510
rebels that he's angry and when he strikes the rock, he does it out of anger. He doesn't do it out

291
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:57.060
of obedience. He does it out of anger. And I, I don't think he's just angry at the people, I believe

292
00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:03.260
he's also angry at God. Anybody else think that too, because God looks at Moses and he looks at him

293
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:04.719
very differently this time.

294
00:52:07.659 --> 00:52:13.709
And, and what God does in this moment is that he wants the people to understand that, that He is the

295
00:52:13.719 --> 00:52:14.699
source of life.

296
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:21.939
And so that's why the people had to be present because no matter what the situation was, God has to

297
00:52:21.949 --> 00:52:28.719
be the source of life. So how many of us are sometimes driven towards finding a solution more than

298
00:52:28.729 --> 00:52:36.280
praying for one? I think that's me like, I mean, honestly, my first thought is often I I've got to

299
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:43.030
figure this out. My, my second thought is after I can't figure it out or I've tried and I failed.

300
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:51.070
Maybe I should spend some time in prayer. I think there's this natural tendency in all of us to have

301
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.500
water gushed from the rock by striking it.

302
00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:06.010
And, and so this natural tendency to try to do something to act and to behave in whatever way is

303
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:13.399
required, no matter what our emotions or our words are. God is saying this is not how you are going

304
00:53:13.409 --> 00:53:21.500
to be trained and transformed in the desert season of your life. He says, I want you to get that. I

305
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:30.729
am the source of life that I God alone am. And then he says to Moses, why do you strike the rock

306
00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:36.919
when I told you it was time to speak and to me it means why are you acting?

307
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:46.280
Why are you trying to work out a solution? Why are you talking to everyone? Why are you going

308
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:54.500
through your contacts? Why are you looking for someone who can perform a miracle that is human when

309
00:53:54.510 --> 00:54:01.399
I alone am the source of the water that you need to gush out from this rock.

310
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:10.479
And God is saying when you get angry, here's what happens. You lose your voice.

311
00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:21.129
You see when you get angry, you disobey. That's why God says, you know, it's ok to get angry but

312
00:54:21.139 --> 00:54:28.419
just don't sin. I, I have not been able to really combine those two yet. You're getting angry and

313
00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:34.939
not sin. Usually my anger is followed by an action of sin, anybody else. But what God is saying is

314
00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:43.459
that you can get angry at the situation but just don't turn your back on me. You can get angry at

315
00:54:43.469 --> 00:54:51.959
yourself but just don't stay there. I want you to turn to me and I want you to understand that when

316
00:54:51.969 --> 00:54:56.879
you get angry instead of spewing garbage out of your mouth,

317
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:10.419
spew praises instead, pray to me instead, don't try to fix this by your hand when all you have to do

318
00:55:10.429 --> 00:55:20.850
is speak it and it will be so. Isn't that beautiful? That's it. Stop striving, stop trying to fix

319
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:28.639
your financial problem by yourself. Just pray that God brings you the finances that you need. Stop

320
00:55:28.699 --> 00:55:36.939
praying that you meet the right doctor and know that you already have the right healer. Stop praying

321
00:55:36.969 --> 00:55:50.219
that you meet the right person who can create openness and breakthroughs in your situation first and

322
00:55:50.229 --> 00:56:01.959
go to God first and see what happens next and see who he puts on your path and see who He brings

323
00:56:01.969 --> 00:56:12.030
into your life. See what he does, see how he changes minds and hearts, see how he transforms the

324
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:21.199
very person who you had given up on. See how God does that because you have made a decision to stop

325
00:56:21.209 --> 00:56:28.540
striking and to start speaking instead. Come on. Am I the only person excited in the room right now?

326
00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:30.770
Right?

327
00:56:36.379 --> 00:56:46.530
Sometimes we have to stop striking and just start speaking. Speaking to God. Psalm 37 8 says, I want

328
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:55.979
you to refrain from anger. I want you to turn from wrath. I want you to not fret. Fred means don't

329
00:56:55.989 --> 00:57:01.969
worry, don't be anxious because it only leads to evil.

330
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.729
See what's beautiful about this passage is that everything in the scriptures is connected. And when

331
00:57:08.739 --> 00:57:16.090
we talk about uh speaking to the rock, the situation in our life, I want us to understand that the

332
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:25.800
rock in this story just like the water. Both are Jesus in John chapter seven, in verse 37 and 38 I

333
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:30.120
want to show you these scriptures. And it says that on the last and greatest day of the festival,

334
00:57:30.129 --> 00:57:37.639
Jesus stood and said in a loud voice. Let anyone who is thirsty, come to me and let them drink.

335
00:57:38.629 --> 00:57:44.320
Jesus is saying, I am not water because whoever believes in me as scripture has said, rivers of

336
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:51.620
living water will flow from within them. And Jesus is saying, whatever your situation is, if you

337
00:57:51.629 --> 00:57:55.949
need water, I want you to know that that water is going to flow from me, so speak to me. I'm going

338
00:57:55.959 --> 00:58:01.489
to do it. I'm the water that you need. I'm, I'm the rock that Moses struck. He didn't have to strike.

339
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:06.949
He just needed to speak to you. See, God wants us to move away from a place where we're striking

340
00:58:06.959 --> 00:58:12.629
things to a place where we have the faith to speak things

341
00:58:17.159 --> 00:58:25.770
and, and, and, and the transition of striking to speaking the length that that takes uh really

342
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.820
depends on us.

343
00:58:31.449 --> 00:58:39.719
I, I hate that I'm a strike first kind of guy. I'm a doer. I don't know if you have that tendency um

344
00:58:39.729 --> 00:58:46.270
to be pro perfectionistic. Even the fact that I mumbled that word bothers me so much.

345
00:58:49.199 --> 00:58:55.090
You see, I, I understand what it means to, to want things to be a certain way. Anybody else like

346
00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:01.699
that. I, I like to keep things in order when things are not in order. It really bothers me for, for

347
00:59:01.709 --> 00:59:07.399
other people, their disorder is order. They know exactly where everything is. You touch somebody's

348
00:59:07.409 --> 00:59:15.229
pile and they'll never find that document ever again. It's lost forever. But, but for me, iii I need

349
00:59:15.239 --> 00:59:22.870
things to be in a folder, in a filing cabinet. It can't be left on a, on a desk, it can't be left

350
00:59:22.879 --> 00:59:29.729
out in the open. I'm not gonna use that as my reminder. Why am I talking about this so much? Move on?

351
00:59:31.949 --> 00:59:33.020
It is not important.

352
00:59:35.639 --> 00:59:43.030
All I can say about this is that we are people who like to strike. I'm like that. But God is saying,

353
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:49.080
I want you to become a person who can speak. In First Corinthians chapter 10 verses three and four.

354
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:55.500
It says this. Look at this, they all ate the same spiritual food and they all drank the same

355
00:59:55.510 --> 01:00:03.419
spiritual drink for, they drank from the same spiritual rock. Look at this that accompanied them and

356
01:00:03.429 --> 01:00:12.820
that rock was Christ. Can we say amen to that? See Jesus isn't just the rock. He's the water. He's

357
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:20.040
both. And when God says, I don't want you to be the one who gets stuck in transition. I don't want

358
01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:24.520
you to be the one who gets stuck in the desert. I don't want you to be that person who's always

359
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:32.409
striking their way to wonder when I want you to speak your way to wonder instead. Um Numbers chapter

360
01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:37.989
20 verse 12, it says, and the Lord said to Moses and Aaron um because you did not trust in me enough

361
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.739
to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land

362
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:53.939
that I give them bye. And what happens to these poor guys who did everything right in their

363
01:00:53.949 --> 01:01:03.250
Brokenness and in their falling forward and sometimes falling back, they made huge mistakes. But

364
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:08.169
this mistake, God is not accepting and the reason is they didn't learn their lesson.

365
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:16.479
You see, they kept striking when God had hoped that by now they would be speaking.

366
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:28.639
And so he said, I can't let you lead these people into my promise because you're part of the people

367
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:39.810
who still are stuck at striking. What are you telling me that Moses was stuck? Yeah,

368
01:01:43.239 --> 01:01:44.679
Moses got stuck

369
01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:54.639
and he never got to leave the desert when he died. God had to bury him. He didn't get to see the

370
01:01:54.649 --> 01:01:55.469
promised land,

371
01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:05.520
man. I don't want that to be me, man. Iii I don't want that to be you. Are you guys listening to

372
01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:05.949
this?

373
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.790
God doesn't want you to get stuck in the wilderness.

374
01:02:14.979 --> 01:02:20.459
I if, if Moses can get stuck, then I know that I can.

375
01:02:24.169 --> 01:02:30.699
But the difference between what Moses had and what we all have is Jesus.

376
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:46.449
Jesus won't let us get stuck because of Jesus. We all get to the promised land. Amen. We all get in,

377
01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:57.199
we all get there by putting our faith in Jesus. You see that, that's the only way this is gonna work.

378
01:02:57.209 --> 01:03:02.679
This is the only way that we're gonna be able to make that transition from striking to speaking. And

379
01:03:02.689 --> 01:03:11.719
so I'm not striking as much as I'm speaking to Jesus all the time. You see, I'm asking Jesus Jesus

380
01:03:11.729 --> 01:03:21.439
in spite of me, feed me, in spite of me, bring me, in spite of me, carry me, in spite of me. Make

381
01:03:21.449 --> 01:03:29.479
sure I make it. You see, you can speak those words right now and Jesus will do exactly that. He

382
01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:40.810
won't keep you from the promise because that's what happened to Moses and Aaron. They were kept from

383
01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.689
the promise from a lack of faith

384
01:03:45.439 --> 01:03:58.080
that seen wonders, but yet it hadn't been enough. And so let the desert train you to be dependent on

385
01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:07.620
the deliverer and let's stop striking our way to wonder. Let's speak it instead. God bless you guys.

386
01:04:07.629 --> 01:04:08.419
Thank you so much.

387
01:04:15.639 --> 01:04:20.280
Can I ask you to stand as we would do that? And can I ask you to just think about the area of your

388
01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:24.330
life where I don't know, you're holding a rock? Are you ready to let it go

389
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.820
about that area of your life where all you see is just this giant stone, but you're not getting out

390
01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.429
of it. What it is that you need,

391
01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:42.429
Jesus saying whatever it is that you need, I can be the living water that can feed your dream, that

392
01:04:42.439 --> 01:04:47.229
can feed your aspiration, that can feed your desire, that can, that can meet your, your need and

393
01:04:47.239 --> 01:04:51.949
your want. I can do it all I can. I can give you exactly what it is that you need. I just don't want

394
01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:58.659
you to strike your way to it. I want you to speak it. Would you put that kind of faith in God this

395
01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:03.750
morning? Would you put that kind of faith in Jesus? Who was both the rock and the water that you

396
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:11.070
need in your life? Let's pray. Father. You see what it is that we need. You see how we need it. You

397
01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:18.340
see how we've been held back and how we're holding ourselves back. And Lord I pray right now that we

398
01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:25.020
would speak to the rock and that we would see the living water gush out that it would transform this,

399
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:32.250
this desert moment into what is finally going to become our destination. Lord, I, I thank you for

400
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:37.340
what you have already done. But, but I I look to you right now and I say, Lord, can you take us

401
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:46.260
further than than ever before? Can you do more than ever before? Can you show me and everyone in

402
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:53.070
this room more wonder than ever before? Can our faith move beyond the place where we're always

403
01:05:53.080 --> 01:06:00.110
needing to strike to the place where we are now finally able to speak. We put you first and we pray

404
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:07.610
to you first. We ask you first, we believe and trust in you first. And then when we see situations

405
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:13.550
and circumstances that we're not running to try to handle it ourselves, but we are putting our faith

406
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:19.639
fully and completely in you because you're the only one that can move us from the desert to the

407
01:06:19.649 --> 01:06:25.270
destination. And I pray right now for the miraculous to happen in the life of every person that is

408
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.750
both here, present and those that are watching. I pray that in Jesus name that you would take this

409
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:38.080
moment for our community of faith as it meets in this location and around the world that you would

410
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:47.000
perform the miraculous for each of us. Thank you Lord, that you are ready to fill us all with your

411
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:56.100
wonder. And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Are you excited for what God is gonna do next?

412
01:06:56.110 --> 01:07:02.280
Are you excited for what God is gonna do in your life for the way that He is going to do the

413
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:08.949
miraculous and show you and reveal his wonder. You keep speaking to that rock, you keep letting that

414
01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:16.020
living water gush out because that's how you will experience your destination. God bless you guys.

415
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.649
Thank you so much. We're going to just sing

416
01:07:21.959 --> 01:07:27.340
this beautiful song at the end and I pray that it just transitions us into a time of community

417
01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:32.830
together. Thank you for being here for being a part of this, you know, churches like this grow

418
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:38.090
because you tell other people about it because you bring someone with you. That's the only way that

419
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:43.580
it does. Um You know, people like to go to a place where they're, where they're heard where they're

420
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:48.969
known where they have friends and, and sometimes we walk into a place alone and maybe that's you

421
01:07:48.979 --> 01:07:55.500
today, you feel alone as you come into this place, you don't know a lot of people. And, but one of

422
01:07:55.510 --> 01:08:00.879
the ways that I can encourage you to, to get to know people is not just by hanging around the cafe

423
01:08:00.889 --> 01:08:06.439
because sometimes, you know, churches can be filled with a lot of shy people. Any shy people in the

424
01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:14.120
room, nobody see they're so shy, they don't even put up their hands. Sometimes people are so shy,

425
01:08:14.129 --> 01:08:22.089
they don't even walk over because they, they just can't seem to do it. But you know, sometimes

426
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:28.109
getting involved, sometimes attending an event, sometimes getting involved in, in, in something on a

427
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.689
Sunday. If that's all the time that you can do, you get to meet people, you get to serve with people,

428
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:39.870
you get to know people, people get to know you. It isn't just about being anonymous for a time.

429
01:08:39.879 --> 01:08:45.290
That's cool. That's good. Sometimes we just need that right. We just need to go into a place and be

430
01:08:45.299 --> 01:08:51.870
anonymous and just receive. That's OK. Sometimes God allows those seasons in our life, but we can't

431
01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:58.339
stay there because here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna stay in a desert experience even when it

432
01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:03.220
comes to community and you're gonna try to figure this out on your own you're gonna try to

433
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:08.490
do this on your way. You're gonna try to do this by yourself and, and, and you're gonna get stuck

434
01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:17.818
and I don't want you to be stuck even, even for a moment longer than you need to be. So let's all

435
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:22.640
get unstuck together. Can we say amen to that? Let, let's just take the next step, whatever that

436
01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:27.930
looks like. I don't know what it is specifically for you, but I know there is one, let God just lead

437
01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:34.629
you and guide you and figure that out because I know that God's gonna do something for us all.

438
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.528
Really? I believe it. We're in that season, but you feel like a new season is upon us. I feel like a

439
01:09:40.539 --> 01:09:45.769
new season is upon your life. I just feel like there's a sense of urgency in your life. Like never

440
01:09:45.778 --> 01:09:52.599
before. I don't think that's just me. II I believe that when I speak to you and I hear from you and

441
01:09:52.608 --> 01:09:59.839
I see what's happening with you. I just want to take a moment to just um you know, say that Cathy

442
01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:06.580
had to, we had to bury your husband on, on Wednesday and to me, it, it, it astonishes me that you're

443
01:10:06.589 --> 01:10:07.060
here.

444
01:10:09.069 --> 01:10:11.240
Um I don't know if I could have gotten out of bed

445
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:24.339
and you, you've been so courageous and so unbelievably loving and patient um with, with Darren and

446
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:32.000
his sickness. It's, it's a witness to us all. So God bless you. We're praying for you, praying for

447
01:10:32.009 --> 01:10:41.700
your family. And, um, it was, it was so hard to do that and I know it's harder still for you, but

448
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:48.770
we're all here for you. We're praying for you. Amen. We're praying for Kay. And so if you can just

449
01:10:48.779 --> 01:10:52.950
say hi to her and maybe give her a hug, it's ok to hug you. It's ok.

450
01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.000
I know we were supposed to sing the song but

451
01:11:01.319 --> 01:11:06.709
you know, sometimes God just puts things on your heart to say and if you don't say them, you get,

452
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:15.709
you go home really, really like aw you're feeling awful and that's happened to me a few times. So,

453
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:22.930
so be patient with me. Uh I don't know who needed to hear that, but somebody needed to hear it. And

454
01:11:22.939 --> 01:11:28.580
so God bless you guys. I love you so much. Thank you for being a part of this and now we can sing

455
01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:32.729
the song. Ok? Thanks. Can we, can we give it up for the team?

456
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:46.370
The words are my fear does not stand a chance when I'm standing in your love. Let's remember this

457
01:11:46.379 --> 01:11:47.910
for this week. Let's listen.

458
01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.379
When darkness tries to run.

459
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:15.459
When sorrow comes right.

460
01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.069
The wind broke. Yes.

461
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:25.200
No. Why?

462
01:12:27.859 --> 01:12:27.879
Yeah.

463
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:01.770
Yeah.

464
01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.040
The

465
01:14:27.509 --> 01:14:27.540
Yeah,

466
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:56.750
you are dismissed. I want you guys to say hello to at least three people that you've never said hi

467
01:15:56.759 --> 01:16:00.009
to before. Have a wonderful Sunday. Bye bye.
