00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:24.300
in Good morning, how are you this morning? Yeah, pretty good. I guess it was the megaton of Montreal

2
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.010
this morning. Was there any marathon ear in the place? Absolutely no way. Okay so all the marital

3
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:39.370
near are are gone. Yeah, exactly. So I'm really happy to be with you this morning. We have a

4
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:46.000
wonderful Sunday prepared for you and for all of us and um, one of the important announcement that I

5
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.380
wanted to mention this morning, have you noted that it's a little bit chilly in the building right

6
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:58.700
now? Yeah, yeah. So we get our air conditioner installed. Okay. As promised. Usually we're due in

7
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:05.290
the summer it's a bit hot and I'm always saying don't worry, it's going to be cold eventually. So

8
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:14.310
now it's time. So yeah, great. And we usually get it uninstalled for the summer next year. Okay, so

9
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.460
we're just a little bit late, but I hope you enjoyed that chili time and remember when it was hot in

10
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.790
the summer. So talking about the weather also, I remind you something really important. So don't be

11
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:34.490
in a rush for Christmas, there's still 91 days for Christmas. Okay, so great news this morning. So

12
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.970
I'm the only one super happy about Christmas I guess, but that I'm living for Christmas. So uh,

13
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:47.860
having said all of this this morning, we'll have the opportunity to sing some songs with our wonder

14
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:55.550
worship team will have also a child education and we'll continue our series called Fresh Start with

15
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:03.750
Pastor Lorenzo. So without further ado, I will ask you to stand up and we'll sing that first song

16
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:12.690
with our wonderful worship team. So can we just clap our hands to welcome them and heat ourselves as

17
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.340
well.

18
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:37.850
Got a notion of comfort that's surrounding me and I hope that gives me joy in my suffering.

19
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.900
And now I can

20
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.110
you are,

21
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.780
we're gonna start singing a new song.

22
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.910
It's so good for you

23
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.200
joining us and we're so glad that you could be a part of this experience today and and for how we

24
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.470
can worship the Lord together. We have a special moment at this time and where we're able to

25
00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.170
dedicate a child before the Lord and as a community of faith that gives us an opportunity to journey

26
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.030
with this family and many of us already know them. We're already doing that in ministry. We're

27
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:15.320
already doing that by fellowshipping together each and every week and we have a wonderful opportunity

28
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:25.760
to welcome the Murray family to the stage and would you put your hands together and welcome them

29
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.440
with me

30
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.880
and and today we're gonna see their youngest, Laura dedicated

31
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.940
and I don't think

32
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:54.390
I haven't seen Daniel look this good since his wedding day and you guys just celebrated a wedding

33
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.990
anniversary not long ago

34
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:05.450
and so welcome everybody. We're so glad that you're here and it's always a privilege to be able to

35
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:13.590
welcome families into our community of faith and to bring Laura their youngest dedicated to

36
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:20.640
the Lord and it's something that was always done in the scriptures and so we have these beautiful

37
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.690
pictures that we can look at as well.

38
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.990
Amen isn't that beautiful? And I just wanted to read this beautiful scripture found in the Gospel of

39
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:25.660
Mark and it reminds us that Jesus wants the little Children to come to him, Jesus blessed the

40
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:37.620
Children and he says that the kingdom of heaven is for such as these and the disciples wanted to

41
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.910
prevent the Children from coming to Jesus because they were bothering him in his time of teaching.

42
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.800
But Jesus welcomed the Children, he took them in his arms and he blessed them. Jesus himself was

43
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:57.570
presented at the temple on the eighth day and all Children before him experienced the same thing and

44
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:07.450
it wasn't because there was a particular religious reason in all of that, but one of surrender and

45
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:16.490
it was based on Hannah having surrendered her son Samuel to God for his purposes. And because of

46
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:25.110
that it was understood that every family should do the same because maybe among them, there would be

47
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:32.920
someone who would be anointed to do God's work like none other before. And so it's wonderful to know

48
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:39.250
that God has a special plan for each of their Children and a special plan and purpose for laura as

49
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:45.990
well. Can we say amen to that and that's why every child is precious and beautiful and important to

50
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:55.160
God. And so we take this opportunity even as a community of faith to ask Daniel and Kathleen as the

51
00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:05.960
parents of this beautiful child, Laura, will you by God's help provide a Christ following home for

52
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:13.630
her and bring her up in the worship and in the teaching of Jesus Christ so that one day she will

53
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:21.190
come to know him as her Lord and savior and follow him all the days of her life. If so then say we

54
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:30.490
will we will and congregation, would you stand with me please and will you, members of the

55
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:39.920
congregation of River's Edge be faithful in your calling as part of the body of Jesus Christ to

56
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:46.980
provide a place where this child and all other Children in your midst may grow up in the knowledge

57
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:57.110
and love of Jesus, our Lord and savior. And if so, answer "we will." Thank you. And so we're gonna

58
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.950
take this opportunity to anoint Laura

59
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:10.050
And to do so in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit one God and the oil is

60
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:18.250
a symbol of the presence and the anointing of the heavenly father and how it was poured out onto our

61
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:25.870
lives through the gift of the Holy Spirit after the ascension of Jesus And we are praying that the

62
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:36.300
Holy Spirit would fill Laura's life. Be upon her life, would anoint her life and prepare her for her

63
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.240
life. And we want to pray right now for you all as a family but in particular for Laura. And would

64
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:49.680
you join me as we would pray together? And so we pray, Oh God, over Daniel and Kathleen, as the

65
00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:56.990
parents, we pray over their household and their family. We pray over Laura and the gift that she is

66
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.790
to this family that has completed them. We pray Lord that you would continue to put your hand of

67
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:11.030
peace, protection and provision upon her life and that you would forever Lord leave your mark on her.

68
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:20.930
One that speaks of your everlasting love and mercy and power that in her and through her you would

69
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:28.150
accomplish great things that you would fulfill your plans and purposes through her, but that you

70
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:35.480
would also give her and grant her the desires of her heart that you would bless her Lord as she

71
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:42.110
grows in the knowledge of Jesus Christ that she would come to receive him one day by her own

72
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:48.890
choosing. And on this day in which she's presented these parents, Oh Lord, are asking for your help in

73
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:56.240
raising your daughter as much as theirs And you have an entrusted Laura to them and you have

74
00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:05.330
entrusted this family to us and together we pray these things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless

You may be seated for real. Yeah. So, but even if you're a little bit tired after sitting and sitting and standing and

111
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:13.410
sitting and standing, think about the poor people that are running right now in the street of

112
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.750
Montreal. Okay, so can you stand again.

113
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:26.280
Okay, seriously, super happy to be with you this morning. Some announcement for you. Let's start

114
00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:33.650
with the first one about the young adult movie night. So I don't know if you have your phone on you

115
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:41.620
right now, but there's a movie night and you get to choose what movie they're gonna listen. Okay? So

116
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:47.430
you can go right now to uh Instagram or Facebook. That's the only time that you'll be authorized to

117
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.190
go on your phone while we're having the service. Otherwise, there's obviously a police officer that

118
00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:00.460
will confiscated your device. But for the moment it's a blague by the way. So sometimes for those of

119
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:07.960
you who are not knowing me very well. Sometimes I'm doing some blagues - jokes. Uh, and um, and I'm not

120
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:14.100
always serious. Okay, so you can vote for the movie, they're gonna listen. So it's either mouse hunt

121
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:19.690
or you go and uh, depending on the result of the vote, that's going to be the movie they're gonna

122
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:27.620
see. So let's vote right now or after the gathering. So movie night this coming Friday at 7:30

123
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:34.240
Community kitchen, we had a wonderful lunch. It was also Kathleen and her team that took care of

124
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:41.920
that first distribution that occurred on September 18. Yeah, absolutely, man, It went super well. So

125
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:49.300
thanks to all the volunteer. That's an awesome events. The next one will be um, on October nine. So

126
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:55.690
please continue to spread the word about the community kitchen being reopened. So that's a really

127
00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:01.620
wonderful thing. And for those of you want to realize, uh, what is it community kitchen? It's, it's

128
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:07.530
a ministry that we had like many, many years ago that we've been forced to stop for many years and

129
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.880
then it's restarting right now. So that's really amazing. And it's something that we talk and talk

130
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.300
and talk and I really hate when we talk too much and don't do enough. So now we're doing and stop

131
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.580
talking. So that's amazing. Thanksgiving Sunday. Thanksgiving Sunday. It's it's going to be October

136
00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:01.230

137
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:08.740
blessing to have her back in our church. So thanks even for serving us once again with that message

138

153
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:22.960
it's wonderful to have like so much life in our community. So, having said that, please welcome

154
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:30.200
Pastor Lorenzo for the continuity of our series. Fresh Start. Thanks.

155
00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.060
So, we are in this series called Fresh Start about revisiting the past for a better future. And

156
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:06.350
we've been looking at stories in the Bible that teach us the principles and how to accomplish that

157
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:12.680
in our own lives. I know that all of us want a fresh start and as we start a new season, we often

158
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.830
look at this season as a new beginning. I don't know if you realize this or not, but we are less

159
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:24.770
than 100 days to the end of the year. We find ourselves in a time and in a season where if you

160
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:32.960
wanted to push a reset button, if you wanted to truly start fresh, if you wanted to start again,

161
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:39.120
this would be the time in which we could do it on the basis of just the calendar alone. I think that

162
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.370
when we think of the fall, we think of things coming to an end and and new things about to begin.

163
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:50.640
And and of course for us, we have mixed feelings because we love summer so much. It's so short, it's

164
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:58.410
too short for us in in this part of the world and in many ways we would want an endless summer. But

165
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:06.090
when we think of things coming to an end, I think we would love to always choose that to have that

166
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:13.500
kind of power and control over that. And we don't always, there's some amazing things that happen in

167
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:20.330
our lives and happen to us and we are a part of those amazing moments even in the lives of others

168
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:26.030
that we wish we had the ability to just keep reliving and then there are times when we just want

169
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:33.200
things to come to an abrupt end, we want to turn the page. We want to even forget the memory of it

170
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:41.540
all together. We don't ever want others to bring it up because it is just way too painful. For one

171
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:49.820
reason or another, we just need a fresh start. We sometimes walk away from places of employment, we

172
00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:56.160
walk away from our apartments in our neighborhoods. We walk away from cities. We even walk away from

173
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:03.880
our lives with relationships in the same way because we believe that if we could do that, then we

174
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:11.020
could get that fresh start. And sometimes the past has this way of just following us into whatever

175
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:18.550
it is that we are getting into next because we didn't deal with it. We tried to run from it, but we

176
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:26.110
didn't realize that it was still running after us too. That as we were running, it was chasing us

177
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:31.520
and not leaving us alone. And sometimes we look at that and we think to ourselves, well that's gus

178
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.340
that's just the devil. That's just that's just satan coming after us. And and then we could say,

179
00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:43.600
yeah, sure, anything that is dark, anything that is evil, anything that is um out to to steal, kill

180
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:50.190
or destroy. We can say that that's in his camp. That's in his category. That's definitely he's

181
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:56.900
definitely the source. He's definitely behind that. But we also have to think of consequences like

182
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:03.170
our actions and what those mean, The ramifications of that and and today I want to speak to you

183
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:11.740
about this really interesting word, it's called repercussions and when we look at repercussions in

184
00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:19.270
the scripture, there's a lot of stories about them, but things that are that are done um by

185
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:27.900
individuals and then there's a consequence that tends to follow and when we change our course of

186
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:35.480
life and when we go in a new direction, when we make a new choice, when we decide to follow Jesus

187
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:44.490
and and we begin to walk in the light and we leave the darkness and the paths of darkness behind, we

188
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:55.320
sometimes come to realize real quick that there are repercussions, there are things that are still

189
00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:04.370
following us into the changes that we've made and in those moments I want you to understand that it

190
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:12.370
isn't that God is absent, it doesn't mean that Jesus hasn't given you a new life and a fresh start.

191
00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:19.980
It doesn't mean that he isn't prepared even in those moments where the past is still in many ways.

192
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:30.000
If I could use the word hunting us that we would understand that God in those moments is still able

193
00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:40.990
to show his miraculous works to free us in those moments to deliver us in those moments to reveal

194
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:48.620
his faithfulness in those moments to work in our character in those moments so that our capacity

195
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:57.540
could be increased so that we would then understand what it truly looks like to live the life of a

196
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:05.670
champion. And so the story that I want to share with you is a story that gave me a newfound

197
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:13.100
understanding as I was praying and asking God for for insights into into people who had in many ways

198
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:19.960
escaped the repercussions. And and and interestingly enough, I had never truly seen this in this

199
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:27.130
passage before. And and I wonder if you may have the same reaction today. And so I want us to look

200
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:35.090
at reading it together. It's found in John Chapter 18 and it's the arrest of Jesus and the betrayal

201
00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:41.890
of Judas. But there's a story in this that I think is often overlooked and and and I believe that

202
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:49.510
today it's going to speak to us in a newfound way. And it says that Jesus had spoken these words and

203
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:56.960
then he went away with his disciples across the ravine of the Kidron where there was a garden when

204
00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:05.890
he entered it with his disciples and now Judas who was betraying him also knew the place because

205
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:12.820
Jesus had often met there with his disciples and so Judas having obtained the Roman cohort and

206
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:18.830
officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, they came there with lanterns, torches and

207
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:25.970
weapons and then Jesus, therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him, came out into

208
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:32.110
the open and said to them, Who are you seeking And then they answered him, Jesus, the Nazarene, he

209
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:38.880
told them I am he and then Judas also who was betraying him, was standing with him. And now then

210
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:45.900
when he had said to them, I am he they drew back and they fell to the ground and he then asked them

211
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:53.060
again, whom are you seeking? And they said, Jesus, the Nazarene and Jesus answered, I told you that

212
00:40:53.060 --> 00:41:00.200
I am he. So if you are seeking me, then let these men go on their way. And this took place that the

213
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:11.090
word which he spoke would be fulfilled and of those whom you have given me, I lost not one. And then

214
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:18.330
Simon Peter since he had a sword drew it and he struck the high priest's slave and he cut off his

215
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:25.160
right ear. And the slaves name was Marcus. And so Jesus said to Peter, put the sword into the sheath

216
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:32.820
because the cup which the father has given me, Am I not to drink it? I want us to look at this

217
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:39.400
particular verse is found in verse four. It's john 18 4. And I want you to pay attention to this

218
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:45.800
particular passage because it's really key into what we're talking about today. In terms of

219
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.840
repercussions, it says that Jesus, therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, he

220
00:41:52.840 --> 00:42:02.760
came out into the open and said to them, whom are you seeking Now? He knows that they're coming for

221
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:11.150
him and he knows that they're also coming to arrest him, but they are also coming in great numbers.

222
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:17.240
They've come already with soldiers and weapons. And the intention that we understand is that they're

223
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:24.390
anticipating a fight. They're imagining that Jesus is not going to go quietly and that his disciples

224
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.440
are gonna fight for him, they're going to do whatever they can to make sure that Jesus is not

225
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:37.940
arrested and so everyone comes prepared and do this is the one who is guiding them to the very place

226
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:45.750
where he knows Jesus would be in a moment such as this and so Judas is there and the high priest is

227
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:51.160
there and his entourage is with him and we have the Roman soldiers and then we have the temple

228
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:57.800
guards and they're all there with one intention and that is to arrest Jesus, but they're also

229
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.650
prepared for more than that. They're prepared for a fight. Now, I don't know about you, but

230
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:11.340
sometimes we go into situations and were anguished, we are distraught, we are dealing with a lot and

231
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.940
we are overwhelmed, were overcome. And I want you to imagine that in this moment Jesus is all of

232
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:22.590
those things, we know that he has been praying to the father that a new way would somehow be

233
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:28.940
presented so that he would not have to go to the cross and he knows that they're coming and he's

234
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:36.730
prepared for that in a way, but is also asking God is there another way and in this moment in which

235
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:44.750
Jesus is in his humanity suffering, it is going to be something that is coming not just for him, but

236
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:52.020
he knows it's also coming for his disciples and so in this time and in this season, in which he is

237
00:43:52.020 --> 00:44:02.330
in, he is at a low point in his life and I want you to imagine that when you are at your low point,

238
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:11.180
that is when you can expect the enemy to arm itself and come and visit you, I want you to imagine

239
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:20.310
that that is when the betrayer in your life is going to show up, okay, I want you to know that this

240
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:25.240
plan, this scheme has been repeated for centuries,

241
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:36.600
that when you are at your lowest, that is when the enemy arms himself like never before and comes

242
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.400
for you,

243
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:51.080
that is when one of your own is gonna rise up and come against you and betray you and so if we know

244
00:44:51.080 --> 00:45:01.320
this, God reveals this, then we can be better prepared for the repercussions because in a moment

245
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:08.730
where Jesus should not have been in control, in a moment where he should have lost his power, where

246
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:15.710
he should have been seen as powerless in a moment in which he should not have been able to keep it

247
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:25.180
together, he does like never before, and what I love what Jesus does is that he stands up and goes

248
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:36.160
out and in the midst of them, he stands between us and the repercussions that are coming now. They

249
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:47.070
are coming there for everyone. And that's why Jesus says, who are you here for? And they have to say

250
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:55.560
we are here for you, we're here for Jesus of Nazarene, we're here for you. And so Jesus says, I am

251
00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:05.220
he, I'm here. And I want you to imagine that when satan comes for you. Can you picture, can you

252
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:16.470
imagine Jesus meeting the enemy, whoever is armed, whoever has come to come and get you at your

253
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:26.630
lowest at your worst in the moment, in which you feel the weakest. Can you picture Jesus coming out

254
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:34.980
and meeting that enemy and saying, who are you here for? And understanding that Jesus is there to

255
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:45.970
come between you and the enemy that is there for you. Can we say amen to that, Jesus is there to

256
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:57.620
intercept, he's there to make sure that they do not touch you. He's saying it's okay if you touch me,

257
00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:05.740
but it's not okay if you touch him, it's not okay. If you touch her, it's not okay. If you touch my

258
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:12.950
son and my daughter, you can come for me, but you're not allowed to come for them. Can we say amen to

259
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:22.010
that? You cannot touch them, That's what Jesus does in this moment, and I want us to look at this

260
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:30.050
definition of what the word repercussion means, it means an unintended consequence That is occurring

261
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:37.430
sometime after an event or action and it's especially an unwelcome one. A repercussion is

262
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:43.940
something that we know has a negative consequence. And the negative consequence in this situation is

263
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:50.580
that while they're coming for Jesus, they're all at risk, they're all in danger and I want you to

264
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.960
understand this and it's very important. I know that no one may be talked about this enough, but

265
00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:02.110
because you made a decision to follow Jesus, you are every day in danger. Every day that you have

266
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:07.190
decided to follow Jesus, the enemy wants you, he wants to come after you wants to steal, kill and

267
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:13.090
destroy anything that has to do with you? Anything that he wants to give you anything that he has

268
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:18.800
promised you, anything that he sees that you are moving towards. His intention is to make sure that

269
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.970
you never get that you never experience that you never live. That that the fulfillment of those

270
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:31.820
promises are never ever realized in your life. And so what Jesus does is that he teaches us that we

271
00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:39.650
don't need to be afraid of this, that we don't have to be worried about this because every time the

272
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:46.460
enemy arms itself and the betrayers come that Jesus goes out to meet them and says, who are you

273
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:55.780
looking for? Who is it that you want and then gives them the answer I am he, I am the one you want.

274
00:48:55.790 --> 00:49:03.240
So you see, because we belong to Jesus and because satan hates Jesus and wants to destroy him and

275
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:09.360
can't, he's gonna go after his followers, you understand what I'm saying? Because he cannot defeat

276
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:16.140
Jesus because he's already lost that fight over and over again. He comes after the ones that he

277
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:27.860
thinks he can fight and beat and win, except that the followers who understand these principles can

278
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:36.940
put them into place and say when the enemy is there, Jesus, you go and you fight for me, Jesus, you

279
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:43.690
present yourself, and that's what Jesus does when he says the words, I am he, what happens? They all

280
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:50.750
fall back to the ground. Can we say amen to that, They cannot even stand before his words. Do you

281
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:58.000
understand what's happening in the story? Even Jesus speaking is more powerful than Jesus acting

282
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:06.950
than taking an action, Jesus just saying the words is more powerful than anything that we could ever

283
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:15.920
say, Jesus just saying I am, he, the enemy falls to the ground. And so you need to understand that

284
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:23.070
when you go out every day of your life, Jesus representing you in the same way that you represent,

285
00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:31.780
Jesus, Jesus has got you covered everywhere you go, you bring him with you wherever you are,

286
00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:40.570
whatever you're going through, Jesus is fully with you. And so Jesus always stands between us and

287
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:47.970
the repercussions, I want you to see another verse here in the story, john 18 8, Jesus answers and I

288
00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:54.870
told you that I am he and then he says, if you are seeking me, look at this, then let these men go

289
00:50:54.870 --> 00:51:03.420
on their way. And in this moment we see that what Jesus does is that he stands between us. But he

290
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:13.240
also does something else. He takes our place, Jesus takes our place. Now in those, in that moment

291
00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.880
they could have been arrested, he knows that they're gonna arrest him. Remember Jesus doesn't just say

292
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:24.440
anything without intent and without purpose. He already knows what's in their heart. He knows that

293
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:32.850
they're not just there for him, right? Because if he knew That they were just there for him and they

294
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:40.060
were going to go, then that would have been the end of it. But he has to say in the verse eight, I

295
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:46.800
told you that I am here to repeat it twice because you can see that the intention that they have

296
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.710
come with has not changed. They're still coming for his disciples. You get it, they're not just

297
00:51:52.710 --> 00:52:01.480
there to get rid of Jesus to get there to get rid of the 12 Because if they can kill all 13 of them,

298
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:10.990
Judas included, I don't think he gets away with it. If they all die, then the movement dies with

299
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.400
them,

300
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:23.530
Satan knows this, satan is a strategist and he knows that no one can escape, no one can get away.

301
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:33.970
And so when Jesus comes and stands between them, he also makes the point that he's going to take

302
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:41.360
their place and he's gonna say, I'm gonna make sure that whatever the repercussions are, they cannot

303
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:54.710
fall on you, they will only fall on me, Jesus takes it all upon himself, everything, and I think

304
00:52:54.710 --> 00:53:01.120
that when we think of this moment, we need to think of it in a much larger context, I think we

305
00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:07.980
talked about Jesus dying on the cross and taking our place, and we talked about the consequences of

306
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:13.540
sin as being the penalty of death, and how Jesus took that death and how he overcame it, overcame

307
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:18.620
the grave, overcame satan in the process and gave us all the victory over those things, not just in

308
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:24.430
this life, but in the life to come, but there is something that is to future oriented for all of

309
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:31.990
that, that sometimes doesn't feel real enough in my everyday and I know that my everyday impacts my

310
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:37.310
future and I know that those things being real today speak to me in a way that tells me I have a

311
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:43.470
future, but there's something sometimes missing from understanding what it is that Jesus is actually

312
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:53.950
doing in this story, And that's why in verse nine, it says that this took place, so that the word

313
00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:04.420
which he spoke would be fulfilled of those whom you have given me, I have not lost, not even one,

314
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:13.560
Jesus says that he's fulfilling in this moment, a prophecy that had been given to the Messiah in

315
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:21.050
this moment, Jesus saying that he is laying down his life so that his disciples get to live in this

316
00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:27.570
moment, we see that Jesus is saying that while they come for you, they cannot touch you while they

317
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:35.540
come to arrest you and kill you and even try to steal or destroy you, they cannot do it because I

318
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:44.820
will come between them and you and I will stand there and more importantly I will take that place, a

319
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:55.240
place that you would ultimately have to take, but I take it in your stead, I go and take it upon

320
00:54:55.250 --> 00:55:02.980
myself and so in that moment we think, well what does that look like in my every day, I don't know

321
00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.590
about you, but there's been moments in my life where I've done some pretty stupid stuff, anybody

322
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:15.490
else where the consequences could have been really devastating, not just for me but for other people

323
00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:20.400
and I've often wondered God, like how did I get away with this? And at first I thought when it

324
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:27.400
happened that I was just like too sly and I was like to like to astute, too aware, too awake, like I

325
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:33.640
was like you know, a person who had thought about all the contingencies and I had gotten away with

326
00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:40.690
it, I had a perfect plan and and I got, I got, I got to do what I wanted to do and then I realized

327
00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:47.980
that what God was doing was that he was protecting me from the repercussions, the things that I got

328
00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:53.320
away with, he only let me get away with it because he knew the impact that it would have in my life.

329
00:55:53.320 --> 00:56:00.560
Later on, he knew that if he covered me with love and with grace and with mercy and compassion in

330
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:07.190
this moment, that it would save me and preserve me from greater consequences and repercussions that

331
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.430
I could not get up from.

332
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:16.500
There were things that happened in my life, like I'm sure happened in yours, that when you look back

333
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:23.060
you say surely God was there in this moment, he kept me and preserved me. He made it so it would

334
00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:28.940
look like I would get away with it. But it wasn't me getting away with it, it was God protecting me

335
00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:35.730
from the repercussions. And I believe that God allows certain things to happen and he covers those

336
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:42.020
things even in the imperfect ways and we think, well how could a God that is supposed to be just

337
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:48.960
allow for things that are in just to happen? Because God sees the whole story and he sees the

338
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:56.470
redemption that will happen in our lives in a way that we cannot fully and in the moment, and while

339
00:56:56.470 --> 00:57:01.830
it looks like we're getting away with darkness, god knows that our path is always leading us towards

340
00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:06.560
his light and when we get there, we will look back and we will renounce that darkness, we will

341
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:12.230
repent of that darkness, we will ask for forgiveness of that darkness, we will confess that Darkness,

342
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:19.850
we will speak of that darkness and we will speak instead of how the light has saved us and how Jesus

343
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:27.610
is that light and how he has lifted the consequences and the repercussions of what has happened. You

344
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:34.880
see like how are you getting to all of this? How are you making this statement that Jesus would

345
00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:42.360
actually protect us from the repercussions? Because Jesus says that his role is not to lose any of

346
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:49.870
us. His purpose is that we would all be saved, that not one of us would be lost. You think there

347
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:58.230
wasn't someone in that 12 who deserved to be lost or we would immediately go to Judas but we would

348
00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:06.410
lose sight of someone else, we would lose sight of Peter and the Bible says that Peter took out his

349
00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:13.150
sword and he cut off the ear of the high priest, now remember they're already there to arrest them all

350
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.410
and now Peter has given him the reason. Yeah,

351
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.590
Jesus had just said

352
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:32.520
you're here for me, take me and saved everybody and then Peter goes and screws it all up.

353
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:40.990
Does that sound familiar with anybody else? How many times have I messed up God's plan?

354
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:52.790
God is like I got you Dude, I already saved you, I already took away the consequences. The

355
00:58:52.790 --> 00:59:04.690
repercussions are already gone, I already took your place and then you go and do this right, I have

356
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:13.350
done that over and over and over again and and then Jesus like no, Peter put that back, put away

357
00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:19.020
that sword, what are you doing dude, I just saved you all and now you put everybody at risk again

358
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:27.120
now they have a reason to arrest you. Don't you understand Peter, it's not gonna be two thieves on

359
00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:33.450
either side of me, it's gonna be one of you guys, there isn't gonna be three crosses, there's gonna

360
00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:41.720
be 11 plus one for me. Don't you understand what's happening here? They're coming to take us all out

361
00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:49.530
and you are playing right into the enemy's plans and I think over and over again God how many times

362
00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:58.320
have I just surrendered to the enemy's plan instead of letting you still stand in the gap and take

363
00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:09.490
the repercussions when I have acted in my own strength thinking I'm saving the day, Jesus needs me

364
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:18.110
to save him and in reality I was just making things worse. Can you guys relate with Look at what it

365
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:19.990
says in Luke 22 51

366
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:29.050
and this is why this is the story of Jesus taking away the repercussions is that Jesus responds and

367
01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:36.480
said stop no more of this and then he does something, he touches his ear and he heals him, he

368
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.510
basically re attaches it now I want you to think of this for a moment because you've probably heard

369
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:47.680
this story and probably know but you've probably never quite seen it like this. When Jesus heals the

370
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.200
servant's ear, it's like the crime never happened,

371
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.070
it's like it never took place. Where's the proof?

372
01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:06.280
If you say that Peter struck the servant and cut off his ear

373
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:16.600
and the guys gushing blood from one side of his head, then where's the proof when his ear has been

374
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:25.160
reattached, can we say amen to that? He just heals him, takes it away,

375
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:32.350
just takes it away. Now in that moment you would think the high priest, the Roman soldiers, the

376
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:37.710
temple guards, everybody would have just fallen on their knees and just said like we're trying to

377
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:43.070
arrest someone who heals people after they've just been maimed, you think that would have been

378
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:48.120
enough and it isn't, no one changes and I'll tell you why because they already belong to the evil

379
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:56.080
one, they already made their choice, they already know which side of the garden they're standing on.

380
01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:05.580
And so when Jesus heals the servant, he erases the repercussions for Peter and for all the disciples,

381
01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:12.980
can we say amen to that, come on, he just took it away, something that would have sent them all to

382
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:22.330
jail as a minimum, that would have imprisoned them all, but ultimately their plan was to kill them,

383
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:35.130
Jesus does it, so that none of that happens and the only one they take is him and Jesus heals so

384
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:43.530
that there are no repercussions and I want you to think of how we've done things that Jesus needs to

385
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:49.730
heal and I want you to think of how people have done things where we need healing,

386
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:57.390
where in the story we could maybe be Malkmus or we could be Peter, but in both cases there are

387
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:03.830
repercussions and we need Jesus to intervene and what Jesus does is that he intervenes from Marcus

388
01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:08.460
and intervenes for Peter and that's what Jesus could do in our lives. So whatever we need, Jesus can

389
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.380
heal and you can remove those repercussions,

390
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.560
are you ready to receive that in your life?

391
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:30.140
Because in this story we see a Jesus who keeps standing in the gap, we see Jesus who is there for us,

392
01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:40.130
we see Jesus who is able to heal and to deliver and to take away and to make whole, we see Jesus who

393
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:47.690
is able to heal every repercussion and so right now I don't know what the scars are in your mind and

394
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:52.800
in your heart and in your life, I don't know what things God needs to heal in your past that you can

395
01:03:52.800 --> 01:04:00.300
have a greater future, but I know that Jesus is ready right now to do all of that for you, so stop

396
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.920
playing into the enemy's hands and start playing

397
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:16.120
for only the winning side and that's Jesus start living your life only for him and yeah, it's tough

398
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:23.330
people are gonna come for you, Yeah, it's tough, Darkness will try to take you out, Yeah, it's tough,

399
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:32.960
you're gonna mess it up, you're gonna try to do it in your own strength. But Jesus keeps healing

400
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:40.180
from all repercussions, That's what he does and he's ready to do that right now. You ready to

401
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:47.430
receive that? Would you stand with me as we close in a word of prayer? I pray that God blesses you guys.

402
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:49.540
That encourages you in your spiritual journey.

403
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:57.770
And so father, we come before you in need of that healing and you know what part of our lives need it

404
01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:03.420
most and whether it's stuff we've done or whether it's stuff that's been done to us. Lord, you know

405
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.380
where to reach what to do. You know how to make that whole.

406
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.880
Marcus didn't ask to be healed, You just healed him.

407
01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:19.220
Peter thought he was doing the wrong the right thing, but he was doing the wrong thing and you saved

408
01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:19.650
them

409
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:29.040
and you took the repercussions, you took them upon yourself and you're doing that right now

410
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:38.390
you remind us that you went to the cross and that by your stripes were all healed that by the scars

411
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:43.550
that you have endured and by what you accomplished that we are all set free. And so today Lord, we

412
01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:51.100
come before you and we ask you for that fresh start, would you take away the repercussions? Lord,

413
01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:56.140
would you heal us from them? Would you stand in the gap for us, would you take them upon yourself

414
01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:02.550
and set us free so we can fulfill the plan and the purpose that you have for us and we pray this in

415
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:11.710
Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You guys good? You encouraged a little bit, a little bit? Yeah,

416
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:24.390
but before we um just indulge at the after party, we're gonna just take a moment and just sing and I

417
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:30.550
love to end the gathering with a song and I feel like sometimes after we've heard a lot of speaking,

418
01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:37.340
um it's really important for us to do some talking to God and, and and the worship song at the end

419
01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:43.450
is really about us taking that time to speak to God and even if we're not singing the words of this

420
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:49.110
song, we're singing the song that is in our heart and that we're speaking to him and we're lifting

421
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:55.190
our prayers to him and and we're giving him an opportunity to, to just see that we've taken this

422
01:06:55.190 --> 01:07:02.500
moment and we want something serious to be done with it, that we're not done just yet and we know

423
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.710
that he's not done with us just yet either. This is a moment that's not going to be just for this

424
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:12.970
moment, but the moments that are gonna come and it gives us an opportunity for us to just surrender

425
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:22.230
in his presence. And so if we stop thinking of it as just music and we start thinking of it as as as

426
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:28.400
praise and worship and as an opportunity for us to connect with God. We are going to experience

427
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:36.010
incredibly powerful moments. Amen. And and that's the transition that we have to make, that it's not

428
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:41.590
what's what's what's happening up here. But this is just to facilitate what needs to happen

429
01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.780
everywhere, wherever we are, wherever we've been, wherever we need to go, whatever we're going

430
01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:56.110
through right now. And so I I believe today and every day in a Jesus who takes away our

431
01:07:56.110 --> 01:08:05.020

Thank you very much, wow. Amazing Sunday as we were told at the beginning. So it's really a

439
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:45.930
privilege to have been with you this morning. Uh, quick elements, just a reminder about generosity.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:52.040
We just want to thank you for everything you're doing for that community if you want to help us and

441
01:11:52.050 --> 01:12:00.330
support us financially. There's four ways to give the machines are there at the end. Also in the

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:06.120
meantime for our next gathering next Sunday, if you need any help, you want to contact us, please

443
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:13.360
