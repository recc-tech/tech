00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:40.789
Hey, good morning, everyone. So good to have you with us isn't a beautiful summer day. So good. I'm

2
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.338
glad that you're here and I know that you just got settled in. Would you just stand with me as you

3
00:08:45.348 --> 00:08:50.768
would open in a word of prayer as we commit ourselves in this gathering to the Lord? And we just

4
00:08:50.778 --> 00:08:56.130
want to welcome you in the spiritual journey that I know you've been on. The things that God has

5
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:01.030
been showing you and teaching you, the things that He's been revealing to you and the things that He

6
00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:07.270
still needs to reveal, the things that He needs to touch us with and speak to us about and, and to

7
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:15.929
have us take steps towards. I think that God is always moving us forward to the things that He has

8
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:21.369
in store for us. But we have to be attentive to that. And sometimes we can shut that down

9
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:29.309
unintentionally. We can say things like I already know this. I've already heard this. I've already

10
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.159
seen this and experienced this. I've already lived this and when we do things like that, we don't

11
00:09:35.169 --> 00:09:40.419
understand that, that God always has something new to show us, see, every time we go to God, every

12
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:45.760
time we go to His word, every time we sing songs, every time we open up our minds and hearts, God

13
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:53.580
has a new way to reveal himself. And if you keep that open mind and heart and spirit, I assure you,

14
00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:59.849
you will never have another dull moment in your spiritual life ever again. There has never been a

15
00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:04.609
moment in my life where I have not said this is a moment where I am learning where I'm growing,

16
00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:10.119
where I am being taught something where I'm being challenged. It's always there. It's just the

17
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:17.049
question is, are we there with him? And so today, I pray that Lord, we would be there with you that

18
00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:22.719
whatever it is that you would have in store for us, that we would listen with a heart that is ready

19
00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:27.429
to receive from you because it's not just about what's happening up here. It's about what's

20
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.580
happening everywhere here in this place and in the same way that you've come into this place with us.

21
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:41.950
You are here in this place with us. You are ready to move in our midst and to do what needs to be

22
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.849
done for each of us. And Lord, we just surrender our lives to you and we say, God, would you do

23
00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:53.880
something new in all of us? Thank you for how you love us for the way you receive us for the way you

24
00:10:53.890 --> 00:11:00.109
accept us. But also for the way that we come before you. And we say, Lord forgive us. And in these

25
00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:06.080
moments that we have together, we, we confess and may we declare the things that we want to see

26
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:14.239
changed in our lives so that God you can deliver us, heal us so you can change us so you can make us

27
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:21.989
new. And we pray these things in jesus' name, amen. And so we have a moment now to just sing some

28
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.219
songs with our worship team. Would you welcome them as we sing our first song? This is Amazing Grace.

58
00:26:21.109 --> 00:26:28.859
What a great set. And uh they'll be back later um at the end of the message and I, I just appreciate

59
00:26:28.969 --> 00:26:35.099
um our kids ministry so much. We have volunteers that are serving right now and if they're, I'm not

60
00:26:35.109 --> 00:26:40.589
sure there, I don't see any kids here. That's great. But at 10 o'clock, um we have the youth that

61
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:48.949
meets half an hour before the service. And so our youth teachers come in early, we know that it's an

62
00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:53.810
opportunity for the youth to get to know each other, to connect and for us to build the youth

63
00:26:53.819 --> 00:27:00.510
ministry. And so by the time the service begins, you know, they are able to join us sometimes after

64
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.849
the worship or just in time for the worship. And so it's wonderful to be able to have that youth

65
00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:11.680
ministry happening at River's edge. And can we just give it up to our youth volunteers uh for making

66
00:27:11.689 --> 00:27:12.359
that happen.

67
00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:21.300
And over the summer, we made a plan that we would start offering kids worship, that we would

68
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:28.880
transition from the kids moving into the annex at this time to right at the beginning of the service

69
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:34.780
so that they could have their own worship time. And so this is now uh I think the fourth week that

70
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:42.339
we have kids worship uh sorry, the third week that we have kids worship. And it's amazing to see uh

71
00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:47.670
just the impact that it's having not just on the kids but on the parents of those kids and the

72
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.770
teachers themselves. They're just thrilled to be a part of it. And we just again, want to thank our

73
00:27:52.780 --> 00:28:01.010
worship team for rotating through and for providing worship every Sunday as we get ready for the

74
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:07.770
fall. And so what we are doing now through the summer is just improving our ministries and getting

75
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:13.160
them ready for what God is going to do. Come September. And so I would ask that you would pray for

76
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:19.069
our youth ministry, pray for our kids ministry, pray about also seeing if you can find a way to

77
00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:25.719
serve in one of those ministries because we need more volunteers as the church grows and as the

78
00:28:25.729 --> 00:28:31.540
ministry expands, we need to expand those classrooms so that they're age appropriate for all those

79
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:36.869
kids. And so if God puts this on your heart, would you let someone know today, both at the info

80
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:43.040
booth at the back or even to one of the teachers? Um Just let them know that you're ready to serve

81
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.459
and get involved and they'll tell you what those next steps are. But we have another ministry here

82
00:28:47.469 --> 00:28:54.089
at River's Edge called the College and Career and College and career is 18 years of age to the age

83
00:28:54.099 --> 00:29:01.390
of 30. And so they are having a pool party today at someone's house and that location remains

84
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:09.930
mysterious only for those who are over 30. So everybody else gets to know where this pool party is.

85
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:15.339
And so if you'd like to know more, um then all you need to do is just head over to the info booth

86
00:29:15.349 --> 00:29:20.300
and they'll give you the instructions about what you need to know. And you can also speak to Nate

87
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:25.859
Samantha or Jenny. They're here today and um and they'll help you out with that. And so they're

88
00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:33.619
offering rides from the church to this house party. Um And there's also uh gonna be food and

89
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:40.660
everything available there as well. So we also have an opportunity for us to just continue to show

90
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:48.689
our support and our dedication and devotion to our community of faith, but also to the Lord. And one

91
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:54.359
of the things that it took time for me to understand. But when I was giving, I was making room for

92
00:29:54.369 --> 00:30:01.250
God to also expand the boundaries of my life. If you could trust me with this, then I knew that he

93
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:07.099
would one day trust me with more than this. But I had to be faithful with what I already had. And

94
00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:12.810
even in the moments in which it was difficult to do so where it was challenging to do so where I had

95
00:30:12.819 --> 00:30:20.530
probably more needs than I had ever considered before. I was reminded of the widow and how she gave

96
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:27.140
that one cent at the temple. And yet who saw that Jesus did, he was there and he paid attention to

97
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:32.390
that gift and he said that she had given everything and yet there were people who were giving much

98
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.609
more. And I really believe that what God looks at is He looks at our heart. He looks at our

99
00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:43.589
intentions, our motivations, and he looks at our devotion to him, first and foremost, that we know

100
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:49.900
that He is the ultimate provider in our lives, that He is always faithful, that he is always going

101
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:55.500
to meet our need no matter what. And so when we worry about things like finances, then guess what

102
00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:02.020
happens? Well, we're just revealing how much we don't trust God. But when we trust God, then we're

103
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:08.579
responsible with what we have to pay. But we're also aware that we have what we need to pay because

104
00:31:08.589 --> 00:31:14.790
our God has unlimited resources and he's always able to provide no matter what you guys believe that

105
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.619
with me. And so let's be faithful. Let's be generous. And let's see, God move in our lives and

106
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:26.739
through them as well in our community of faith, that soul appreciates every gift and donation that

107
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:32.050
you make. Well, we have the after party at the end of the gathering and just thank you to our cafe

108
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:38.040
team to putting that together for us and uh just for you to have some refreshments at the end just

109
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:43.280
to hang out and um and just to get to know one another. And I, and I hope that if, if you're a shy

110
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:49.560
person and if you're an extroverted person that I would ask that all the extroverts in the room

111
00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:57.489
would look out for the shy people and that you would make um uh an intentional walk across the room

112
00:31:57.819 --> 00:32:03.109
and get to know someone that you haven't met yet. And say hi to someone that you haven't said hi to

113
00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:08.069
yet. And, um, and just know that this is an opportunity also for many of the single people in this

114
00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:14.209
church to meet their future spouse. And so, you know, you have to be intentional with every moment

115
00:32:14.859 --> 00:32:20.099
and the after party is all about that too. You know, you don't know, you don't know what's gonna

116
00:32:20.109 --> 00:32:25.699
happen. But if you're always shy in the house and how are you going to meet a good Christian guy, a

117
00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:30.589
good Christian girl? You know, it's probably going to happen more likely here than somewhere else.

118
00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:36.660
And so does it mean there aren't broken people here who's not broken here, raise your hand like I'm

119
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:43.869
not, I gotta, you know, if I try to raise my hand, God's gonna chop it off. We're all broken. We're

120
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.040
all messed up somehow. But hey, we can all help each other to get to a place where we can become

121
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:54.160
whole, where we can become healed, where we can learn from each other, learn from our mistakes. And

122
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:59.579
that's what we do in community. So let's uh let's have fun at the after party afterwards as well.

123
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.380
And so let's watch this bumper video as we transition to our message time today and it's the message

124
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:10.290
is on uh avoiding road rage. And so let's take a look.

125
00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.390
We've all discovered that not all journeys are fun and they're not, they don't all look like that

126
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.219
and feel like that either sometimes when we find ourselves leaving a place and heading towards a

127
00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:11.530
place that land in between is the most discouraging, frustrating and disappointing time of our lives.

128
00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:17.800
And I think that many of us can understand how it can be easy to get angry in those seasons of our

129
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.729
life when we find ourselves leaving some place that's fertile and then heading towards a new place

130
00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:27.979
that's fertile, but we haven't gotten there yet. And the whole point of what God has been showing us

131
00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:34.060
in this series and in the scriptures is that the getting there part is about avoiding certain things

132
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:39.780
and, and one of those things that we do need to avoid is road rage. I don't know about you what

133
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:47.429
you're like once you get behind the wheel of a car, but I've seen people completely transform people

134
00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:53.580
that you would never expect to be that angry when they're driving. Just, I don't know where it comes

135
00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:59.949
from. I don't know why it comes out the way that it does, but they become extremely aggressive and,

136
00:34:59.959 --> 00:35:07.030
and, and their favorite, you know, just utility in the vehicle is the horn, like they just lean into

137
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:14.899
it. And it's interesting. There's a lot of information on the internet about how to avoid road rage.

138
00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:21.810
And I just found the topic itself just to kind of be a little interesting when it came to the advice

139
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.520
that they were giving and I thought some of it was good and some of it I don't think would

140
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:31.830
necessarily help. But let me just give you some examples. One of them was give yourself time to get

141
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.350
where you're going. And so obviously, if you give yourself time, you're going to be more patient.

142
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:45.439
But if you're always late, then you're gonna see that you're gonna just put yourself in a position

143
00:35:45.449 --> 00:35:53.760
where your patience is going to run real low. It's also about before you get behind the wheel, just

144
00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:02.979
create realistic expectations about your travel. You know, I mean, you can't get into the car at

145
00:36:02.989 --> 00:36:07.699
three o'clock thinking that you're not going to find traffic. You can't think that you're going to

146
00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:13.310
get to where you need to in 30 minutes when you're in bumper to bumper traffic. And you know that

147
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.810
there's a lot of road closures and I mean, we're called the Orange Cone City for a reason. I mean,

148
00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.469
we, we kind of know how our roads are going to be. You kind of know you have to give yourself extra

149
00:36:23.479 --> 00:36:30.709
time. I lately for the past month, I can't even leave my street because everything is blocked. It is

150
00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:36.739
so complicated just to get onto another road so that I can just leave my neighborhood. I can't even

151
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:42.540
do that without it being complicated, not only just getting home, but actually just leaving home.

152
00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:51.479
And I think that when we try to drive, we also are experiencing just intense emotions. Sometimes

153
00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:57.159
we're anxious already. We're nervous. We're fearful, we're behind the wheel and we're already

154
00:36:57.169 --> 00:37:04.340
anticipating that, that people are around us are all trying to crash into us. Or we're the ones who

155
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:10.840
are just driving in a manner that it feels like, well, other people are just like honking at us

156
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:18.800
because they are fearful of how we're driving or how we're distracted, fiddling with the radio,

157
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:25.500
maybe adjusting something with our phone or just, you know, watching Netflix, that kind of thing. We,

158
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:31.080
we, we sometimes begin to swerve a little bit and, and, and, and, and, and people honk and it makes

159
00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:38.360
them anxious and then we get angry at them, uh, you know, be understanding also of other drivers and,

160
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:44.669
and how they may not see what it is that you're doing. Um, has that ever happened to you to arrive

161
00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:49.870
at an intersection and, and people just don't know the rules, like you're supposed to let the person

162
00:37:49.879 --> 00:37:56.959
on your right go, but the person on your left goes first, it's like, no, that's wrong. And so that

163
00:37:56.969 --> 00:38:01.979
can set you off sometimes, you know, the road rules better than other people. And because you do

164
00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:07.860
that, that knowledge can sometimes just make you impatient about what other drivers are doing

165
00:38:08.179 --> 00:38:15.110
sometimes because of the glare of the sun. It was a time when I came to a light and I didn't see

166
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.669
that the person had their Flasher on. And I thought to myself, why is this person not telling

167
00:38:20.679 --> 00:38:26.580
everybody else that they're turning? And as they got closer, I saw that they actually had it. It's

168
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:31.770
just that I couldn't see it because the sun was shining so brightly. They had done the right thing.

169
00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:37.020
But I just assumed that they had done the wrong thing. I think there are a lot of examples in which

170
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:44.340
in our life and in our time, we can just sometimes just do things that just get other people upset

171
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:54.810
and not just ourselves being upset by what other people are and aren't doing well. There's a new

172
00:38:55.590 --> 00:39:02.310
thing happening in the city. It's like a an attraction and it's called uh a Rage Cage. Has anybody

173
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.959
heard of this? I just, I just heard about this actually not long ago, like literally a few minutes

174
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:14.270
ago, like literally in the green room because this is how spiritual we are. We, we sometimes have

175
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.179
conversations about things of what happened in the week. And apparently there's a Rage Cage that's

176
00:39:19.189 --> 00:39:25.629
available for like 45 bucks an hour. Basically where you can go in and you can pick your item of

177
00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:31.919
destruction and your tool of destruction. They give you a full protective suit and then for the next

178
00:39:31.929 --> 00:39:39.090
hour you get to smash things. I know some of you are saying I want to try that. I want to do that.

179
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.050
Well, there's a few people on our worship team who already did it

180
00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:50.580
and, and, and I, I just, I just like, wow, really? There's something that exists like, like this.

181
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:55.800
Yeah, it's called the Rage Cage apparently. And it's in the plateau, check it out and I am making

182
00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:02.739
money from this announcement and I just wanted to make that clear. No, I'm not. But you can see how

183
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:09.070
the need for something like this would be created, right? Would you say that percentage wise that

184
00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:15.209
you're angry in the course of a day? I don't know, 10% of the time. Would that be safe? Like a safe

185
00:40:15.219 --> 00:40:28.110
number? 10%. Uh How about how about if it goes to 20 what about 30 what about 50%? What if you find

186
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:34.830
the majority of your day? Just, just, just always dealing with anger. How are you gonna release that

187
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:41.459
anger? What things are you going to do to release it? And, and, and what I know is that the angrier

188
00:40:41.469 --> 00:40:51.860
we are the people who get hurt the most are the anger carriers because often we don't do anything

189
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:58.239
with that anchor. Um But there are times when we can be explosive and we can be destructive, we can

190
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:04.419
be abusive, we can hurt someone and sometimes it's intentional. Sometimes it's unintentional,

191
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:11.600
sometimes we just lose it and our language flows in a manner that is unbefitting a human being, let

192
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:18.280
alone a follower of Jesus. There are times when our emotions are just taking control and to a

193
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:28.340
measure and to, uh, and in a manner in which if, if Jesus was in the room, he's taken cover because,

194
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.260
because we just scared the son of God.

195
00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:36.770
And I, and I think that those are the moments when we feel the worst about ourselves, not the best.

196
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:41.409
I, I don't think I've never seen anyone get angry and feel good after it. I've never seen anyone say,

197
00:41:41.419 --> 00:41:45.860
wow. You know, I just can't wait for the next time to have an outburst like that. I've never heard

198
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:51.159
that. I've never seen that. That's a moment when we're, we're obviously at our lowest, you know, and,

199
00:41:51.169 --> 00:41:56.129
and people have witnessed that and, and, and sometimes like when they've witnessed it, they're like,

200
00:41:56.139 --> 00:42:02.219
wow, like this is really scary and, and, and you, you try to understand like, what are you really

201
00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:08.860
angry about and sometimes what we're angry about is just manifesting itself in ways that we just

202
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:14.729
never expected and anticipated and anything can set us off. I remember one time my mom, you know,

203
00:42:14.739 --> 00:42:19.719
she had been in this extremely long battle with cancer. She had ovarian cancer and it was detected

204
00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:26.199
unfortunately, too late and she had gone through two operations rounds of chemotherapy and radiation

205
00:42:26.209 --> 00:42:33.149
and this poor woman just had gone through it all. And, um, and I was spending a lot of time with her.

206
00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:37.310
She was living with me and, you know, sometimes I just sit with her and she'd just be in pain. I

207
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:43.610
just, just, just cradle my mom. And the last days where she just, she just was just telling me I

208
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.159
just want to go, I just want to go and be with the Lord. I said, just hang on a little bit more, you

209
00:42:48.169 --> 00:42:53.050
know. And I was saying, saying those things more for me than for her, you know, but, and she wanted

210
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.790
to live, but she just realized that her time for life had come to an end. And, and II, I remember

211
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.080
getting so angry with God and getting so so angry and frustrated that that our prayers weren't

212
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:11.219
working, that God wasn't healing my mother, that the cancer that we had heard she had been now in

213
00:43:11.229 --> 00:43:17.280
remission from had come back and, and it had spread throughout her body. And I was angry with the

214
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:23.139
doctors who didn't detect it because we had gone and brought her to so many specialists. And if it

215
00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:29.020
had been just cut from the first doctor from just a regular physical exam, but they were just

216
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:34.199
listening to more what my mom was saying and not checking her body and the pain that she was

217
00:43:34.209 --> 00:43:40.479
experiencing. They're prescribing medication, but they weren't paying attention to the symptoms that

218
00:43:40.489 --> 00:43:46.689
were leading her down a path that she would never return from. I remember being so angry with all

219
00:43:46.699 --> 00:43:52.590
those things and saying, why couldn't have this been caught sooner? I had so many questions and the

220
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.689
anger was just there. I didn't know it was there and here I was just like being a good son and I

221
00:43:57.699 --> 00:44:03.219
thought of being a good husband and father and yet there would be some, something would happen and

222
00:44:03.229 --> 00:44:10.419
all of a sudden I would have an outburst of anger and, and it was just because of my Brokenness, it

223
00:44:10.429 --> 00:44:16.669
was because of my anger of the situation. It was just expressing herself itself in ways that I just,

224
00:44:16.889 --> 00:44:23.649
I just couldn't imagine that that was me in that moment. And I think when you're in that, in between

225
00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:31.649
place, it can be such a dangerous place, a place where you can just just fall into a place of anger

226
00:44:31.659 --> 00:44:40.219
and questioning and, and, and, and that's when questions abound, they abound when we're in the land

227
00:44:40.229 --> 00:44:48.090
in between and when they are bound, here's what happens. Um Our, our anger is intensified. You see

228
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:54.169
the more questions you have, the anger you get, the more you feel you don't have answers and

229
00:44:54.179 --> 00:45:01.969
solutions, the angrier you get. And it's hard to just trust God and release things and just accept

230
00:45:01.979 --> 00:45:07.909
things and just to go with the flow of things when, when, when you won't accept them, when you can't

231
00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:13.659
accept them, when you need a different outcome, when things have to change, they must change, I will

232
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:22.850
not accept them the way they are. Well in the scriptures in numbers chapter 11 and verse 11 to 15. I

233
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:31.090
wanted to read these verses to you. And it says that Moses said to the Lord, why are you treating me

234
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:42.040
your servant so harshly? Have mercy on me. What did I do to deserve the burden of all these people?

235
00:45:43.229 --> 00:45:53.070
Did I give birth to them? Did I bring them into the world? Why did you tell me to carry them in my

236
00:45:53.080 --> 00:46:02.959
arms? Like a mother carries a nursing baby. How can I carry them to the land? You swore to give

237
00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:10.379
their ancestors. Where am I supposed to get meat for all these people? They keep whining to me

238
00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:19.209
saying, give us meat to eat. I can't carry all these people by myself. The load is just far too

239
00:46:19.219 --> 00:46:27.560
heavy. If this is how you intend to treat me, then just go ahead and kill me. Do me a favor. Moses

240
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:34.100
says and spare me this misery. Wow. Are you kidding me? This is Moses,

241
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:44.669
this is Moses angry. This is Moses carrying a burden. He doesn't want to carry anymore in the

242
00:46:44.679 --> 00:46:52.209
passage that we just read. The questions are abounding and Moses is the one who's in a very angry

243
00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:57.989
and frustrated manner is, is speaking to God about them. And what we need to be aware of is that

244
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.689
when we find ourselves in situations like this, here's what you have to already know you are going

245
00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:13.969
to have an emotional breakdown in the same way that when you're on a journey. You have to anticipate

246
00:47:13.979 --> 00:47:21.860
for when your car will break down. You have to be careful that when you do stop that, you check the

247
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:26.860
car to make sure that especially if you're on a long journey that you're going to be able to get to

248
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:33.709
where your destination is. You can't just trust that the car is going to get you there. You have to

249
00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:40.489
make sure that the car gets you there in the same way that we can't just trust that we can go from

250
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:47.010
one place to the next. We have to ensure that we are doing what we can and what we need to, to make

251
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:53.239
sure that we get there. And what God does is that He provides what we need to make sure that the

252
00:47:53.250 --> 00:48:02.489
journey is a journey in which we make it. But we have to anticipate that we are going to have

253
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:10.830
breakdowns. II, I see that what ha what's happening in this story with Moses is that his questioning

254
00:48:10.879 --> 00:48:19.739
leads um to blaming and what happens is that blaming leads to breakdowns?

255
00:48:22.459 --> 00:48:30.189
Ok? You see the more you blame, the more you break down the angrier you get and the further you get

256
00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:39.719
from your destination. And what God does is in this passage is that He shows us all of Moses's

257
00:48:39.729 --> 00:48:47.760
questions and you know that he actually asks six questions in that prayer. And by the way, Moses is

258
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:55.449
praying when he's speaking to God and there are six questions that he asks and all of them are

259
00:48:55.459 --> 00:48:55.979
blaming

260
00:48:58.229 --> 00:49:05.979
and because he's blaming, he's having a breakdown. And II, I know that this is speaking to you. I

261
00:49:05.989 --> 00:49:11.399
know it's, it's resonating with you because what's happening right now is that sometimes it feels

262
00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:16.110
like God isn't coming through on his promises and sometimes God doesn't come through on his promise

263
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:23.370
because people break their promises isn't that true? Sometimes the letdown, the breakdown is coming

264
00:49:23.379 --> 00:49:28.979
because we've broken promises to ourselves. It's because we've broken promises to others. It's

265
00:49:28.989 --> 00:49:36.399
because others have broken their promises to us. And it feels like because there's a breakdown in

266
00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:42.419
the promises being fulfilled in our lives. What's happening is that we start to blame the people

267
00:49:42.429 --> 00:49:47.629
around us, we start to blame ourselves. We start to blame the things that haven't come to pass. We

268
00:49:47.639 --> 00:49:54.949
start questioning and in the questioning, we get angrier and it's normal because it's happening to

269
00:49:54.959 --> 00:50:02.659
one of the greatest prophets in the scriptures. It's happening to Moses. But what the scriptures

270
00:50:02.669 --> 00:50:08.929
also reveal is that even in his questioning, there's a difference in the way that he's doing it

271
00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:14.800
versus the way that the Israelites are doing it. Because the difference between complaining and

272
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:23.750
praying is what Moses also reveals. You see, God is so understanding of who we are, where we're at,

273
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:30.540
of what's happening to us, what's been done to us, what we're, you know, personally responsible for

274
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:37.080
what others are directly responsible for God is aware of all of that. And so he has a measure of

275
00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:45.229
grace and mercy and compassion. He has, he has a deep love for us. He can listen to us complain all

276
00:50:45.239 --> 00:50:54.330
day and it doesn't change his love towards us at all. He can look upon us and his and his eyes never

277
00:50:54.340 --> 00:51:02.110
stop staring. They never stop loving, they never stop communicating that there is no one and nothing

278
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:09.649
that is more important to Him than you right now. You see, God wants us to understand this to the

279
00:51:09.659 --> 00:51:17.030
very depths of our being. You see the difference between complaining and prayer is seen in the way

280
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.889
that the Israelites complained. You see, the Israelites complained about God, they complained about

281
00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:30.139
everything. And God is saying there's a difference between complaining and a difference between

282
00:51:30.149 --> 00:51:31.469
complaining about me.

283
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:36.899
You see, and what Moses did is that he complained,

284
00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:41.040
but he didn't complain about God.

285
00:51:43.489 --> 00:51:48.830
He didn't turn his heart away from God. He turned his heart towards God.

286
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.550
You see, the people were complaining, but they weren't praying

287
00:51:55.810 --> 00:52:00.459
every day. They just got angrier and they kept complaining about their condition and then they would

288
00:52:00.469 --> 00:52:04.629
go to Moses and they would say Moses do something about this. And what Moses would do is they would

289
00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:09.520
take all the burdens of the people and all of their complaints. And then He would go before God and

290
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:17.070
say God, I'm, I'm gonna complain to you, but I'm gonna complain in prayer. See, he wasn't just

291
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.020
complaining about God. He was complaining to God.

292
00:52:24.449 --> 00:52:31.189
And I, I wonder if we know what this distinction is when we're doing it ourselves. You see, when I

293
00:52:31.199 --> 00:52:35.030
complain to God, I know that God is still my solution.

294
00:52:37.379 --> 00:52:42.550
When I complain to God as angry as I am. I know that I don't want to turn my back on Him.

295
00:52:46.729 --> 00:52:54.409
I would, I would rather die than, than, than not have in my life because life without God is that

296
00:52:56.429 --> 00:53:03.270
not just here but in the life to come. And so I know that I need to have God in every aspect of my

297
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:08.149
life. So I'm not going to complain about God. I'm going to complain to God because I know God can

298
00:53:08.159 --> 00:53:15.649
handle it. And if there's a place where God can receive my complaints and then help me emotionally

299
00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:22.629
with those complaints and subside my anger because of those complaints. It's when I'm praying

300
00:53:24.959 --> 00:53:29.439
and you see, and every time I would look over to my mom and I would see her not getting better and I

301
00:53:29.449 --> 00:53:35.419
saw her getting closer and closer to death. And when I had to spend the last days and hours with her

302
00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:40.879
in palliative care, I couldn't imagine my life without her because she had been everything to me.

303
00:53:40.889 --> 00:53:46.139
And I didn't want her to go until the very end. I just kept praying and believing even when they

304
00:53:46.149 --> 00:53:54.000
were, you know, it's just administrating the, the things that they give to, to just make the pain go

305
00:53:54.010 --> 00:54:03.669
away. I was still believing and hoping and, and I could just feel my anger still just stare at the

306
00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:04.409
surface.

307
00:54:07.639 --> 00:54:16.959
And then I just started praying and releasing. And yet I was complaining to God, but I was

308
00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:23.719
complaining to him in prayer. And when I complained to God in prayer, here's what happened. So I

309
00:54:23.729 --> 00:54:24.860
started crying,

310
00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:32.340
my complaining prayers turned into praise. Yes.

311
00:54:34.489 --> 00:54:40.199
And I started thanking God for my mom. And for the time that I had her for the woman that she was

312
00:54:40.209 --> 00:54:45.080
for the patience she had for the love she gave me for the forgiveness. She offered me for the

313
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:51.290
unconditional support she had for my, my life for the way she helped me in my ministry for the way

314
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:55.909
that she cared for me. When I would walk in through the door for the way she would ask questions to

315
00:54:55.919 --> 00:55:01.479
see if I was ok and knew exactly which questions to ask because she knew there was an answer that

316
00:55:01.489 --> 00:55:07.100
needed to come out. And she only knew how to get it out of me. And you see when, when you, when you

317
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:13.300
go from a place of complaint to a place of prayer, it's, it's when you can really release your

318
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:18.899
burdens. And you know, Moses, one of his biggest complaints in this prayer is that why have you

319
00:55:18.909 --> 00:55:24.270
given me this burden to carry, right? And sometimes it just feels like when things are not going

320
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:29.350
right? You're like, why did I have to get this burden? Why is this burden in mine? Like why did I

321
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:36.709
have to be the one who goes through this? Like, oh, did I give birth to these Israelites Moses says,

322
00:55:37.169 --> 00:55:42.669
did I bring them into the world? Like I, I get it when you're married to someone when they're your

323
00:55:42.679 --> 00:55:49.179
child. Uh When you're, you know, the, the, the primary caregiver, when you're the person who's been

324
00:55:49.189 --> 00:55:54.899
given this responsibility, I get it when, when that person is, is like your mother, your father. And

325
00:55:54.909 --> 00:56:00.100
even if you haven't had a good relationship, maybe you're the last person who cares enough in this

326
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:06.120
world to even care about them. Have you ever been there? Nobody else will even go, no one else will

327
00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:12.570
even do anything but you show up. You know, I remember doing a funeral for a Hollywood stunt man.

328
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:19.889
This guy was like famous, famous guy from Montreal, famous and he had done like all the most

329
00:56:19.899 --> 00:56:28.000
incredible movies that we just, I could list them and, and, and when I went to do the funeral, I

330
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:33.060
went because someone from the congregation said, pastor, this guy didn't have much family and he's

331
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:39.510
only got a sister left and I was like, would you show up at this funeral? And would you, you know,

332
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:46.699
bury this person? I said, Absolutely. So I went and, and it was, it was me, the person from the

333
00:56:46.709 --> 00:56:51.439
congregation who told me about it and his sister and this famous person,

334
00:56:53.810 --> 00:57:01.850
no one cared enough to be present at his burial. And when I talked to the sister, I said, what's

335
00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:11.300
going on, what's happened here? And she's like, he's lucky this sob that I'm even here. I was like,

336
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.250
I guess there's, there's been issues,

337
00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:23.610
there's been problems, something's happened. I just, my intuition was really strong in that moment,

338
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:31.739
God was speaking to me so powerfully. I was just reading, reading things just getting it. And I was

339
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:36.580
like, what do you mean? Like, what happened? It's like, oh, you know, she goes into her story and,

340
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:43.600
and I said, um, I'm really sorry that you've gone through. This is he goes, this has been a burden.

341
00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:50.610
I just, I just want to bury him and be rid of my burden. So can I, can I just explain something to

342
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:57.810
you that even after today, the only way this burden will ever be buried is if you give it to Jesus,

343
00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.429
there's no other way.

344
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.030
And she started to tear up and she started to cry and she goes, you know, I, I couldn't even bring

345
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.810
myself to honor him by burying him. I've kept him in a freezer for a year. That's how much I hated

346
00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:23.310
him. And I said, and how, how have you felt during this year? The worst I've ever felt in my life.

347
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.620
And, and doesn't that tell you what you need to know?

348
00:58:28.179 --> 00:58:33.149
Can we take this moment that when we bury your brother, you're gonna bury this burden at the same

349
00:58:33.159 --> 00:58:35.729
time and she did

350
00:58:37.969 --> 00:58:45.300
and she was set free because there's a moment when you literally have to bury those burdens. And if

351
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:52.830
you haven't done that and if you haven't literally sometimes even gone in your backyard or in a

352
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:59.219
public park or in your neighbor's yard, the guy you hate, maybe, I don't know and dig a hole

353
00:58:59.229 --> 00:59:04.100
literally and say, I'm going to take my burden and I'm just going to shove it down this hole and I'm

354
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:09.510
going to bury it and I'm going to leave it here. Sometimes the actual act of digging a hole and

355
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.800
burying something is more than enough. And I'll tell you why it's important because if symbols

356
00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:21.870
weren't important, then Jesus wouldn't have told us to bury our old life in water baptism. You see

357
00:59:21.879 --> 00:59:26.860
when you get baptized in water, you're dying to the old life, you're burying the old person and

358
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:31.399
you're being raised in the new person. And then you have to remind yourself all of you that have

359
00:59:31.409 --> 00:59:37.620
been already baptized that when you do that, you're saying I am burying my past once and for all,

360
00:59:37.629 --> 00:59:42.409
because there's only one life to live and that is the resurrected life and the power of the

361
00:59:42.419 --> 00:59:43.760
resurrected Lord.

362
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:54.300
I'm gonna bury this and I'm not gonna let it live anymore. That's what you need to do. And sometimes

363
00:59:54.310 --> 01:00:00.669
the only way to do that is, is symbolically, he's actually going through with exactly that. You know,

364
01:00:00.679 --> 01:00:05.530
if you think Moses was the only person who went through this, you're wrong. It wasn't just Moses, it

365
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:12.649
was also Elijah, it was also Jeremiah. Look at Elijah. Look at what he says in first kings 19 4, he

366
01:00:12.659 --> 01:00:18.510
says he went on alone in the wilderness. He traveled all day. He sat down under a solitary broom

367
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:24.929
tree and he prayed that he might die. And he said these words, I've had enough Lord take my life

368
01:00:24.939 --> 01:00:28.469
because I'm no better than my ancestors who have already died

369
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:36.939
in Jeremiah 20 in verse 14. He says, I curse the day that I was born. May no one celebrate the day

370
01:00:36.949 --> 01:00:44.800
of my birth. Why was I ever born? In verse 18? My entire life has been filled with trouble, sorrow

371
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.439
and shame.

372
01:00:47.679 --> 01:00:54.659
And so we understand that people who had the presence of God to a measure and in a manner that none

373
01:00:54.669 --> 01:01:00.510
of us have ever had. They saw God in a way and heard from him in a manner that I would, I would

374
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.979
yearn to have that kind of an experience.

375
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:13.149
Moses was called the friend of God. Elijah performed miracles in a time in which people stopped

376
01:01:13.159 --> 01:01:20.949
believing in them. Jeremiah spoke to a people who refused to repent and yet they continued to carry

377
01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:28.350
the burden. But with that came anger and here's what we see happening in their lives. And it's a

378
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:35.370
warning to us in our lives. And here is the warning God gives. He says, don't spiral into spiteful

379
01:01:38.449 --> 01:01:44.620
because we begin to spite people, spite things, spite events, spite circumstances. And then we can't

380
01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:50.820
see how God is using those moments and those opportunities in our life to grow our character, to

381
01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:56.979
change us, to strengthen us, to prepare us for the journey that is ahead. There is nothing that has

382
01:01:56.989 --> 01:02:03.100
happened in your life, whether it be by your choosing or someone else's choice, that isn't something

383
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:09.760
that God can use to still get you to your destination. And so you have to resist

384
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:20.760
and do not spiral into becoming someone who is spiteful. But instead I need you to pour your heart

385
01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:29.520
out to the parental father heart of God. You see Matthew 11 verse 28 it says this. Then Jesus said

386
01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:39.860
these words come to me all of you who are weary and you carry heavy burdens and I am the one who's

387
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:46.580
going to give you rest. So Jesus says, if you don't know how to bury this, let me bury it for you.

388
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:53.260
Can we say amen to that? If you don't know how to bury it, if you don't know how to get rid of it,

389
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:58.989
if you don't know how to give it up, if you don't know how to let God do what he needs to do.

390
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.949
Instead let him do it. If you can't let him, you see when they were complaining, they were praying

391
01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:10.419
and you know what they were saying and complaining, they were saying, God, I've got a heavy burden.

392
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:15.520
I don't know how to carry it. Why did you give it to me to carry? Here's what I'm going to do with

393
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:18.750
it. I'm going to give it back to you for you to carry it for me.

394
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:27.050
And you see, when Moses did that, when Elijah did that and when Jeremiah did it, they all got to

395
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:33.290
continue on the journey and arrive at the destination that God had in store for them. You see, God

396
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:40.590
was always with them even though they had spiraled into moments where they were spiteful, but God

397
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:47.469
was giving them the opportunity to grasp this concept. And what Jesus does is that He makes it clear

398
01:03:47.479 --> 01:03:55.830
for all of us. He says, if you can't get rid of this burden, then give it to me, I'll carry it when

399
01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:02.600
Jesus was on the road to gal, when he was going to the skull, the hill in which he would be

400
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:10.209
crucified, he had to carry the cross and he carried the cross until someone was chosen by a Roman

401
01:04:10.219 --> 01:04:17.449
soldier to carry it for Jesus. And there was a rule back then that you had to carry whatever a Roman

402
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:25.239
would impose on you to carry and, and the rule was you could have to carry it for one mile. And it's

403
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:30.000
interesting because Jesus said something in his teaching about what it looks like to be his follower.

404
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:36.000
And he says, when someone asks you to carry something for one mile, carry it for two,

405
01:04:39.649 --> 01:04:45.250
and the person who carried the cross, that person, Simon and Cyrene couldn't carry it all the way

406
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:52.600
because Jesus had to be the one who did it. And, but he got a break and he's forever remembered as

407
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:59.659
the person who carried Jesus's burden, even though it was in voluntary. He did it nonetheless. And,

408
01:05:00.419 --> 01:05:04.590
and it was imposed, it wasn't something that was voluntary on his part. But he, but he's remembered

409
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:10.750
in history forever for it. II I wonder is there a moment in your life where you feel like God is

410
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.879
telling you to help someone else carry a burden? You see, because it isn't just about giving it to

411
01:05:15.889 --> 01:05:20.409
God and it's just not just about giving it to Jesus and it's not just about bearing burdens and

412
01:05:20.419 --> 01:05:26.510
letting him carry them. There are times when God calls on us in the scriptures that because we are

413
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:32.679
to love one another, that we are to carry one another's burdens. And there's a time when God is

414
01:05:32.689 --> 01:05:37.250
gonna ask you to accompany someone to their death and you're gonna have to be the one who becomes

415
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.229
the burden bearer,

416
01:05:41.929 --> 01:05:49.149
no one else but you, you become the primary person who becomes the burden bearer. And, and in the

417
01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:55.399
same way that Jesus carried our burdens. God has made it possible for you to carry someone's burden.

418
01:05:55.459 --> 01:06:02.110
And I want you to understand that there is a special place in God's book of honor and blessings and

419
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:12.080
favor for those who carry the burdens of others because it is an ultimate act of sacrifice. It is

420
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:20.729
putting yourself aside so someone else can flourish and so that someone else can achieve, someone

421
01:06:20.739 --> 01:06:33.090
else can experience just the respite the rest that they need. And if you can ease someone's burden,

422
01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:43.489
you are walking in the footsteps of Jesus. You are following him so closely to his heart and his

423
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:52.149
intention and his motivation and to his calling that you resemble Jesus in those moments more than

424
01:06:52.159 --> 01:06:58.709
any other. Because when you carry someone else's burden, you are being just like Jesus.

425
01:07:01.709 --> 01:07:07.699
And so when we come before God, God says, I want you to come before me, I want you to come and I

426
01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:13.879
want you to cry out. I don't want you to hold anything back, just come cry out, just, just go ahead

427
01:07:13.889 --> 01:07:21.370
and complain. But when you complain, just do it to me. And then let me, let me work in your heart.

428
01:07:21.379 --> 01:07:26.979
Let me work in your life. Let me help you with your anger. Let me take care of your burden. Let me

429
01:07:26.989 --> 01:07:36.050
show you what I can do next. And in Psalm 69 in verses one and two, it says this, save me. Oh God.

430
01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:43.139
For the flood waters are up to my neck. A deeper and deeper. It says I sink into the mire. I can't

431
01:07:43.149 --> 01:07:49.850
find a full hold. I am in deep water and the floods they overwhelm me. If you feel like you're

432
01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:58.189
drowning in debt. If, if you feel like you're in over your head, if you feel like crying out, I'm

433
01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:06.439
sinking you. You're speaking the language of the psalmist right now. And God is saying, come and cry

434
01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:14.620
out. It's ok to say these things. It's ok to recognize your limitations to where you're struggling

435
01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:19.080
to where things are hard to where things are not working the way things are not the way they're

436
01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:23.990
supposed to be. But then in Psalm 13, again,

437
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.970
in verses five and six, it says, but I trust you.

438
01:08:31.299 --> 01:08:40.759
I trust you in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me. I will sing to the

439
01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:51.939
Lord because He is good to me. Our hope for the future is anchored to God's faithfulness in the past.

440
01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:58.910
And so you can look to your future and say because God has been faithful, then he will be faithful

441
01:08:58.919 --> 01:09:08.119
now and you can move from the place where you're complaining to the place where you're praising to

442
01:09:08.128 --> 01:09:16.298
the place where you are able to experience what God has in store for you. God says I want you to be

443
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:24.310
honest, I want you to be real. I want you to be emotional with me. I'm ok with all that. When you're

444
01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:33.729
angry, be angry, but don't turn your back on me because I'm the burden bear. I can bury that burden.

445
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:40.850
I can carry it for you. I'm the one who can get rid of it when the time comes, come to me and cry

446
01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:47.850
out. See what you need to say. I'll still be here after you're done. Can we say amen to that? Oh man,

447
01:09:52.089 --> 01:10:02.020
God does not walk out on us when we go on a rant, God does not walk out on us when we vent. God

448
01:10:02.029 --> 01:10:09.229
doesn't walk out on us when we are at our worst. When we've said the worst things,

449
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:18.259
when all He's seen is anger. He doesn't walk out on us. He will still be there for you. He will

450
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:26.479
still be there for me. God will never leave us. He made a promise and He will keep that promise. He

451
01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:35.080
will never forsake us because He is the burden bearer and He will bury our anger and He can do that

452
01:10:35.089 --> 01:10:39.399
for you. Are you ready to have him do that in your life? A man

453
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:48.729
and then invite you to stand with me as you would pray. And I just want you to just give in your

454
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.910
mind and in your thoughts and in your words to God, your anger right now, I want you to give him

455
01:10:53.919 --> 01:10:55.819
your burden? What are you angry about?

456
01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.660
What are you frustrated about? What is it that is just getting you out of sorts? What is it that is

457
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:09.569
just occupying way too much of your time and it's affecting you and it's affecting other

458
01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:14.609
relationships because of it. What is it that is holding you back from, from just trusting God and

459
01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:19.770
what he has in store for you? Are you ready to give that to him right now? And let him be your

460
01:11:19.779 --> 01:11:26.879
burden bearer be the one who buries your anger, who takes your complaining and turns it into praise.

461
01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:31.990
You're ready for that. Let's pray, father. You know what it is we're thinking about. You know what

462
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.370
it is that we're saying? You know what it is that we need, you know what it is that we're dealing

463
01:11:38.379 --> 01:11:44.660
with and what we've gone through and what we're still going through and you see us all in this, in

464
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:52.140
this land in between. You know, we just want to get to that place that you have promised us. I wanna

465
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:56.950
pray for your healing over us. Lord. I wanna pray for your deliverance over us. I wanna pray for

466
01:11:56.959 --> 01:12:02.700
your forgiveness over us. I wanna pray that you set us free from the burdens that we've been

467
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:10.839
carrying, from our complaining and from our anger, you know where it is that we've been struggling.

468
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:17.279
Lord. We want to give it to you. Help us Lord to move past these things and to, and to experience

469
01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:21.350
them in a newfound way. I pray that today would be a day where we could start again

470
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:30.080
and that we can give all of this to you and have our fresh start right now and we pray this in Jesus

471
01:12:30.089 --> 01:12:37.290
name. Amen. Amen. You excited about your next steps. Are you excited about what God's gonna do next

472
01:12:37.299 --> 01:12:43.729
in your life? Amen. Well, let's sing this song together and then we're gonna wrap things up. You,

473
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:48.799
you're gonna be dismissed after this song and, and we'll have an opportunity to just hang out at the

474
01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:55.560
after party. Thank you for being here for being a part of this gathering. Um You know, it's just a

475
01:12:55.569 --> 01:13:01.779
blessing that we're, I think as a church, we, we, we can all feel and sense that we're in a new

476
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:10.330
season. You guys feel that God's doing something new, not just in our midst, but just with us. And

477
01:13:10.339 --> 01:13:14.580
II, I know that when God starts to bless the community of faith, it's because He's blessing. People.

478
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:23.000
See a church never gets blessed before its people. A church is blessed because of its people. And,

479
01:13:23.009 --> 01:13:27.520
and so when you experience blessing in your life, when you have breakthroughs in your life, the

480
01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:33.609
church is blessed and it creates space for more people to come and experience breakthroughs and

481
01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:41.189
blessings. And so I, I know that God is, is, is accomplishing blessing and breakthroughs in your

482
01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:48.029
life. And, and as a result, we, we're, we're all just feeling that we're experiencing that. So, so

483
01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.680
keep being faithful to God. Keep letting him be the one who gives you your blessing and your

484
01:13:53.689 --> 01:14:04.009
breakthrough. Don't be a complainer be the one who follows the deliverer, the burden bearer, the

485
01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:12.660
healer, the miracle worker, the one who takes every burden and turns it into a breakthrough. God

486
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:13.879
bless you guys. Thank you so much

487
01:14:16.689 --> 01:14:22.970
to get really into this worship. This is a great song called You are Good. After this service. In

488
01:14:22.979 --> 01:14:29.259
His message, we are going to say that we are so thankful and that God is so good. Let's do this.

498
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.509
Thank you. You are dismissed to the after party. God, You are so good all the time. Amen.
