00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:59.720
Alright. So good to have you with us on Labor Day weekend. Really appreciate you and thank you for not

2
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:07.369
having any plans. Would you stand? I always wonder like who's gonna be here on this long weekend and,

3
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.019
and you guys are here. So that's awesome. So glad that uh we can have this gathering together. We're

4
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:18.299
gonna start with a super dynamic song and we're gonna be able to worship God together in just a few

5
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:24.489
moments. And uh because it is Labor Day weekend, uh we are actually not having a kids program in the

6
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.049
annex. It's gonna happen back there anyways, there's uh a station set up for the kids and people

7
00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:36.209
will be there to watch them. So just keep that in mind that as soon as the worship is over, the kids

8
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.959
can then go and uh you can just enjoy the service while that's happening. And because again, it is

9
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.230
Labor Day weekend, our team is off for this Sunday in terms of the after party. So there's

10
00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:53.769
absolutely nothing for anybody. So if you're thirsty hungry, it's only gonna have to be for Jesus

11
00:07:53.779 --> 00:08:00.989
because we don't have anything else to offer uh but next Sunday, um the team is back and we're

12
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.790
excited to have a kids ministry, an after party ministry. It's all gonna happen next Sunday. And uh

13
00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:11.950
we have more announcements to share later. But for right now, why don't we just turn our attention

14
00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:16.570
to the Lord and uh and ask him to bless us and to bless this gathering, father. I want to thank you

15
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:23.200
for every person that is here uh for the way that you are the one and truly the only one that can

16
00:08:23.209 --> 00:08:29.609
give us rest. I pray that today would be a significant moment for all of us. And that as we would

17
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:36.539
worship you as we would hear words about you, that we would read the scriptures that you have given

18
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:45.250
us, which are your words to us. I pray that they would truly give us rest. And I ask these things in

19
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.380
jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's worship together. Would you welcome the Rivers edge

20
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:57.849
worship team? We're gonna do the really fun worship. We're going to praise the Lord. I want you all

21
00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:02.469
to be clapping and shouting and hooping and hollering with us. We're gonna sing this song called

22
00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:04.200
praise. Let's hit it, Josh

23
00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:10.840
to

24
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.200
my

25
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.739
That's why we're gonna praise him. I praise him.

26
00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:37.780
A what

27
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:49.760
Crazy.

28
00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:00.289
I'm breathing reason.

29
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.520
I pray when I feel it.

30
00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:23.250
Wow. I

31
00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:30.880
up.

32
00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:47.419
some breathing.

33
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.659
No

34
00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:27.679
you pray.

35
00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:53.849
there's nobody praise because you're starving. Pray because you rain praise because you rose that I

36
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.090
praise your faith. God's here too in.

37
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.669
Oh,

38
00:12:16.219 --> 00:12:16.450
thanks.

39
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.960
That's right. Be quiet.

40
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.619
let's say

41
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.390
We're gonna take it down a night

42
00:13:50.859 --> 00:14:01.760
when we feel that we're in an ocean, overwhelmed by sickness, financial stress worries, obligations,

43
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:11.900
responsibilities. And we feel like we don't have any firm foundation. We turn to him. He is where

44
00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:20.460
our feet can stand and he will pull us out of those waters. And so today, if you're feeling

45
00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:29.080
overwhelmed like you're in an ocean and you're drowning, hold on to him. He's there for us. Let's

46
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.909
sing this together,

47
00:14:51.119 --> 00:14:52.130

00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:56.309

just

61
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:18.969
We need to trust in God. And this is to sing to our Lord that we trust our God, who is our savior,

62
00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:26.270
our Lord. He will never fail us in all the trials that we're going through in our lives. We know

63
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.869
that our Lord and savior is there for us. Always for us. Sing the song. Trust too

00:20:48.579 --> 00:20:49.569
Bless it. A

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.050
Jesus.

66
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.469
He's been my fourth man in the

67
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.119
to 10.

68
00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:18.109
Yeah,

69
00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:27.430

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:31.109
must.

71
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.270
he will never,

72
00:21:46.829 --> 00:21:47.949
I trust in.

73
00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:09.589
perfect.

74
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:14.469
Yeah.

75
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.229
No,

76
00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:38.500
crazy.

77
00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:03.790
will never fail.

78
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.770
Trust, Daniel. Nice.

79
00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:15.319
You

80
00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:23.239
will never fail.

81
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:43.229
he will never fail us. Oh, no, he's been there for you today. He'll be there for you tomorrow. Don't

82
00:23:43.239 --> 00:23:52.250
lose hope. He is with us. I sought the Lord any answer I sought the Lord and he the answer. I

83
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.150
any answer. Yes. That's not the mhm

84
00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:18.959
I sought the Lord and he heard

85
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.380
that's what trust

86
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.709
thought the Lord and he heard

87
00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:38.630
if you start and he heard.

88
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.640
That's what

89
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.040
that

90
00:25:06.949 --> 00:25:07.199
no,

no,

93
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.369
he will never fail.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.209
Awesome and

107
00:27:31.579 --> 00:27:33.849
spra we trust you

108
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.479
last week.

109
00:27:50.849 --> 00:27:57.319
Well, thank you. Worship team. That was amazing. A lot of energy there. Huh? Oh

110
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:06.219
It's such a blessing to have you with us on this uh Labor Day weekend. We hope that you can find

111
00:28:06.229 --> 00:28:13.550
rest, not just in his presence here, but over the course of, uh, this weekend and, and hopefully

112
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:19.150
tomorrow as well. Um, I don't know about you but I had a really busy day yesterday. Anybody else

113
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:27.189
have a busy day. It was, uh, it was a busy day. I had to, uh, do some chapels for the football team.

114
00:28:27.199 --> 00:28:34.839
Plus I had a wedding to do and it was an hour away and it was, uh, you know, kind of exhausting. And

115
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:42.719
it, it seems to me sometimes when I prepare a message, uh before I ever think that it's for the

116
00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:49.520
people that are going to come to hear it. I always know that it's for me. And, uh, and, and I really

117
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:57.260
needed this message for, for my own life and the message is called redefining rest. It's, it's, it's

118
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:03.890
about having a new comprehension and a new understanding of, of what rest really means for us in our

119
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.619
everyday. And, and I know that we always look for our holidays to provide rest. We look for the

120
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:17.400
things that we really are passionate about, the things that give us energy instead of taking it from

121
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:24.800
us to give us rest. We look for seasons in which we can get away and just experience rest. And

122
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:31.479
there's always this pursuit of rest. And then I begun to understand that in my own life that God had

123
00:29:31.489 --> 00:29:37.430
to help me to redefine that and and then one of the ways was helping me in terms of understanding

124
00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:45.579
what it would look like for this message. And um in case everybody's confused, I'm gonna do the

125
00:29:45.589 --> 00:29:50.630
announcements at the end. Sorry, I forgot to mention that. So we're, we're, we're gonna do the

126
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:58.989
message part right now. And uh so when we think about Mark 6 31 sorry, I had to tell my team what we

127
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.300
were doing because they, we were all lost. Um redefining rest. And we're gonna look at this passage

128
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:13.489
called Mark 6 31. And you'll see that this happened in the life of Jesus and his disciples as well.

129
00:30:14.219 --> 00:30:22.520
And it says that Jesus said, let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and I want us to rest a

130
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:31.890
while. And he said this because there were so many people that we're coming and going that Jesus and

131
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:39.530
his apostles didn't even have time to eat. And I don't know about you, but sometimes it feels like

132
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:46.300
that. Did you ever have a really busy day? And you were unintentionally fasting anybody that when

133
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:52.270
you finally did get a chance to eat, you overate just because you were compensating for all the time

134
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.390
that you didn't get to do that. You were so ravenous by the time that you finally sat down to eat

135
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:03.310
something that you didn't care what it was, you just knew you needed to fuel your body. And in that

136
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:09.150
moment, you just gorged on whatever was available. And I know that that's something that can happen

137
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:17.810
to all of us. And, and Jesus identified that the disciples that he was with, they needed rest. And

138
00:31:17.819 --> 00:31:25.699
so he was the one who led them to a place of rest. And I think we have to start there. Jesus sees

139
00:31:25.869 --> 00:31:32.459
what you're going through. He knows the rhythms of your life. He knows the rest that you need. And

140
00:31:32.469 --> 00:31:40.839
what Jesus wants to do is he wants to lead you to a place of rest in the same way that he was able

141
00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:48.079
to do this with his disciples. He's able to do this with us. And so maybe right now you're not

142
00:31:48.089 --> 00:31:57.660
trusting your ability to rest. You're not seeing the season in front of you, of rest. You're

143
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:04.949
thinking about all the things that keep disrupting your rest and being obstacles to your rest and

144
00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:11.959
are in the way to you having rest. But I want you to know that Jesus sees you're coming and you're

145
00:32:11.969 --> 00:32:19.180
going and he sees that sometimes you don't even have time to eat. And he says, I want to lead you to

146
00:32:19.189 --> 00:32:28.380
a place where you can experience rest. Can we say amen to that, that God sees that in our life? And,

147
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:34.500
and what really helped me to kind of redefine my understanding of, of rest were uh a couple of books

148
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:39.079
that I wanted to just put them on the screen for you and in case you're interested and, and maybe

149
00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:44.930
reading up on this topic, you can take a look at some of them. And this one here is, is called

150
00:32:44.939 --> 00:32:51.400
leisure and spirituality. It's a biblical historical and contemporary perspectives by Paul Heinzman.

151
00:32:51.689 --> 00:32:58.439
And then the other book is called God Technology In the Christian Life by Tony Reinke. And, and both

152
00:32:58.449 --> 00:33:03.430
of these books just kind of like, helped me to have a better understanding of what the rhythms of

153
00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:11.050
rest are really supposed to be like in our lives, in our everyday lives. Uh Like you, I, I feel like

154
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:17.510
there are times when I'm addicted to, to technology where I feel like I'm on my computer and on my

155
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:25.290
phone way too much. I, I feel like it's, it's absorbing my time in ways that are not healthy for me.

156
00:33:25.849 --> 00:33:31.579
Uh There are times in which I, I get obsessed with TV shows and, and I feel like I gotta binge them

157
00:33:31.589 --> 00:33:37.510
all and I feel like III, I have to know what's coming next and I hate the fact that sometimes they

158
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.400
only get released like one week at a, at a time. I feel like, why, why do I have to wait? You know,

159
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:49.560
I wish they would just release them all at once. And, and, and II, I see myself thinking these

160
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:56.739
things and then uh living out these patterns and I'm thinking, why am I like this? Why am I so

161
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:02.819
absorbed by this? Why am I so consumed by this? And I, then I notice that it's actually not giving

162
00:34:02.829 --> 00:34:10.669
me any rest. I, I'm supposed to be relaxing but it's not doing what I thought it would do. It, it's

163
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:18.958
entertaining me, but it isn't doing anything to replenish me. And, and so I have to understand that

164
00:34:18.968 --> 00:34:25.179
there's principles in the scriptures that God gives us to kind of help us to understand this. You

165
00:34:25.189 --> 00:34:32.169
know, II, I think some of us are, are just driven to work. It's just we look for things to do. My

166
00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:40.310
wife calls me uh the CEO of the cupboards and fridge at home. It's, it's a weird name but she said

167
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.009
when I don't have anything to do II, I feel like I need to reorganize, I organize the cupboards and

168
00:34:47.019 --> 00:34:52.049
I organize the fridge and I look at expiration dates and I make determinations of whether or not we

169
00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:57.138
should keep this. And I'm always doing this and, and, and she calls me the CEO of the fridge. It's

170
00:34:57.148 --> 00:35:07.459
pretty funny, right? But it's not funny for me because I'm like that just like, just relax. Like,

171
00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:13.449
why do, why do you have to always be busy looking for the next thing to do? And I, and I feel like

172
00:35:13.489 --> 00:35:19.280
that God is, is, is just bringing me into a season of my life where he wants me to redefine. This is

173
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:25.889
anybody else being convicted of this and being spoken to about this about how things need to change.

174
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:34.850
And, and II, I want you to understand that sometimes. Look, we can be super chill and, and maybe

175
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:41.360
even, I don't want to use the word but, but just I'll, I'll change it like, like we're, we're a bit

176
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:48.310
slack when it comes to, to work ethic. Maybe just to, to dealing with issues. Maybe we, we have a,

177
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:54.429
we have this thing where we procrastinate a lot. II, I want, I want us to understand that even those

178
00:35:54.439 --> 00:35:59.110
things, believe it or not are anxious, inducing.

179
00:36:01.439 --> 00:36:09.439
I, I was talking to someone just this past week about how I have learned that whenever you delay

180
00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:18.659
responding to a text, an email or a phone call that you feel like you can't deal with it in the

181
00:36:18.669 --> 00:36:25.870
moment. So you push it down the road in terms of what you've got to get to. But here's what happens

182
00:36:27.229 --> 00:36:37.780
instead of postponing anxiety and worry and dealing with things later thinking that it will be

183
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:46.689
better. You are actually increasing your level of anxiety in the moment. Your level of worry does

184
00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:54.290
not decrease, it increases. And so sometimes when we push things down the road and we say we will do

185
00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:03.219
it later. We are actually doing our rest at this service. We're actually making things worse for

186
00:37:03.229 --> 00:37:10.239
ourselves instead of dealing with it in the moment. And I'll tell you the moment you do respond all

187
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:16.989
of a sudden you've given a response. Even if the response is, I will get back to you, I will do this

188
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.500
at a later time. I promise to get back to you within a time frame, whatever it is already, you are

189
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.189
going to be dealing with the anxiety in your life and the worry and the concern that comes with that

190
00:37:28.389 --> 00:37:36.949
rather than just ignoring it. And I say all this because I have learned these things from a

191
00:37:36.959 --> 00:37:44.949
firsthand perspective. And I feel like God has led me to make these changes in my life and I wanna

192
00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:49.939
share them with you. And here's one that I thought was really important to point out, especially as

193
00:37:49.969 --> 00:37:56.360
we've come of gotten out of this, Getting There series. We finished that last week and we were in

194
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:03.610
the book of Exodus and Numbers the whole time for 10 weeks talking about transitions. And, and I

195
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.909
believe that this verse is so pertinent even just for today. It's, it's one that we didn't read

196
00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:16.219
during the series, but one that I want to highlight today and it's an Exodus 16. It's in verse 27

197
00:38:17.379 --> 00:38:24.510
and it says that some of the people went out anyway on the seventh day and look at this, but they

198
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.409
found no food.

199
00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:33.969
And, and there's this thing where in the scriptures, right? From the beginning, God tells us that we

200
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:41.860
have to incorporate rest that on the days that we do not do this. Here's what's going to happen, we

201
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:46.570
are going to be unable to harvest or to reap anything when we go out.

202
00:38:48.979 --> 00:38:57.389
and God is saying, I'm gonna make sure of it because my principle to you is to incorporate a rhythm

203
00:38:57.399 --> 00:39:01.959
of rest. And if you don't do it, here's what's gonna happen on the seventh day. When you go out,

204
00:39:02.409 --> 00:39:11.030
you're gonna find nothing. It's going to result in nothing. You're going to find yourself feeling

205
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:22.590
nothing so that you never forget how important rest is to me and how important it should be to you.

206
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:31.610
Is that speaking to anybody today? Sometimes I'm like that person who goes out on the seventh day. I

207
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.580
was, I felt like I was always that person out on the seventh day.

208
00:39:36.969 --> 00:39:39.330
I really felt that II I was that

209
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:47.149
and III, I look at how God speaks to Moses and he tells him this instead.

210
00:39:49.159 --> 00:39:53.239
He says in Exodus 33 14, the Lord replied,

211
00:39:55.629 --> 00:40:04.850
I'm gonna personally go with you and I'm gonna give you rest and everything will be fine for you.

212
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:12.889
And all of a sudden, God does something. He he redefines what rest is by saying that it's Him, he's

213
00:40:12.899 --> 00:40:19.729
our rest. And then when we're looking for rest, if we try to find it in anything other than Him,

214
00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:23.590
we're not going to find it. It's going to be fleeting, we're going to find ourselves empty and we're

215
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.469
going to be like that person who goes on on the seventh day and finds nothing and experience is

216
00:40:28.479 --> 00:40:34.840
nothing. And so God is saying, can you understand this part that when I go with you, that's how you

217
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:40.389
experience rest. And so that's really helped me a lot because, you know, the days that I don't want

218
00:40:40.399 --> 00:40:47.500
to respond or the days that I don't feel like hustling the day that I don't want to work hard and

219
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:51.820
the day that I don't want to deal with something and I want to procrastinate and put it off in, in

220
00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:57.719
those days when I feel like I don't have the energy where I just feel so tired where I feel like I'm

221
00:40:57.729 --> 00:41:04.959
so unmotivated that I'm having to do a task in a situation that I really don't want to do in, in, in

222
00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:12.169
circumstances that I just want to completely avoid when I reframe it. And I say, God, I want you and

223
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:22.100
I need you to be my rest. Guess what happens? God changes everything for me in that moment. And God

224
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:29.360
is saying that if, if you invite me into your life in the moment, when you need rest, guess what? I

225
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:34.760
will become the rest that you need. And that's amazing to me because I thought my circumstances had

226
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:43.620
to change, you know, III I thought I had to, to journal my change. I had, I thought I had to podcast

227
00:41:43.629 --> 00:41:44.639
my way to change.

228
00:41:46.649 --> 00:41:51.439
I thought I had to do all this work to bring about change. And then I realized that what I was

229
00:41:51.449 --> 00:41:54.139
missing all along was, was just God.

230
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:03.959
I didn't have enough of him. I wasn't connected to him the way that I needed to. And so I found

231
00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:15.929
myself really suffering in my everyday life, grasping for rest and never experiencing. And so in

232
00:42:15.939 --> 00:42:22.780
Ephesians chapter five, it, it tells us that in verse 16, that we need to make the most of every

233
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:28.909
opportunity in these evil days. And, and I need us to understand that when the scriptures tell us

234
00:42:28.919 --> 00:42:33.280
something, we have to pay attention to it. Uh What, what, what God is basically telling us through

235
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:42.179
this passage is that, you know, while every day belongs to the Lord, every day is also evil.

236
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:50.909
And so I, I, if I make a decision to live my life for God with God, then that, that's gonna be a day

237
00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:52.050
that the Lord has made.

238
00:42:55.870 --> 00:43:03.010
But, but if I don't make that choice, then the day, the day has the potential to be evil.

239
00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:14.979
But the way that a day is not evil is when I have the God of rest journeying with me, even though

240
00:43:14.989 --> 00:43:16.000
the days are evil

241
00:43:18.389 --> 00:43:25.060
and He protects me from the evil. He blesses me in spite of the evil. He gives me rest, even when

242
00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:31.439
the evil surrounds me and tries to choke out the rest that God wants to give me.

243
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:42.689
And when God gives us these verses, he's giving us like these principles in helping us. And so I

244
00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:48.629
also had to redefine what, what rest was because, you know, one of the things that I always saw rest

245
00:43:48.639 --> 00:43:57.820
as was, uh a day where I didn't have to work and I just associated that as being one and the same, I

246
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:05.310
just assumed that it was always the same thing. And, and so what I wanted to do was just to ask you

247
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:17.060
to do the same thing today. I want you to reconsider our non work time such as leisure activities. I

248
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:30.350
want you to rethink your patterns of consumption and whether it negatively impacts you or others and

249
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:39.860
in your life is fragmented or integrated. And if you can do this for a second here, this, this is

250
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:48.159
just about being open to what might need to change in our lives. Because what we often do is that we

251
00:44:48.169 --> 00:44:59.949
engage in leisure activities that do not bring rest. We have patterns of consumption which disrupt

252
00:44:59.959 --> 00:45:10.229
delay and even destroy our rest. And then we look at it and say, is this affecting me negatively?

253
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:17.030
And what about those around me? Because even though you have been engaged in something that has

254
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:25.270
given you rest, maybe it has disrupted somebody else's. And I'm telling you that when God wants to

255
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:33.709
give you rest, those around you don't become anxious because of it, those around you don't sleep

256
00:45:33.719 --> 00:45:34.570
because of you

257
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:43.139
trying to pursue and experience your rest. The people around you don't stay up wondering and

258
00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:47.370
worrying about where you are experiencing your rest.

259
00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:57.870
So what God is saying, we need to find a way that these things become integrated and sometimes we're

260
00:45:57.879 --> 00:46:01.899
experiencing rest in a way that we have to do it in darkness.

261
00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:12.659
We have to do it in isolation and we have to do it absent from the people that we do life with and,

262
00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:18.419
and when we do those things, we think that we're going to go out and experience rest and then go

263
00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:25.399
back to living the life that we normally live. And we think that we are going to live a life of rest.

264
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:32.320
Instead, not only has rest eluded us, it is being destroyed in those around us.

265
00:46:36.719 --> 00:46:44.979
And so in the book by Paul Heinzman, the author of Leisure and Spirituality, Biblical historical and

266
00:46:44.989 --> 00:46:50.250
Contemporary Perspectives, he says this, he says that the research that I have conducted has

267
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:59.040
revealed a negative correlation between the frequency of TV, watching and spiritual well being. And

268
00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:07.979
also that a mass media leisure style is associated with lower levels of spiritual well being than a

269
00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:10.719
leisure style focused on personal development.

270
00:47:14.199 --> 00:47:20.489
And in essence, what this is saying is that the research clearly shows that when we work on

271
00:47:21.149 --> 00:47:27.280
improving ourselves, we experience more rest than instead of avoiding ourselves.

272
00:47:32.199 --> 00:47:38.679
And then I'm thinking, why, why is that like, like the way I need to take a vacation sometimes is

273
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:46.729
for me. And I know, you're, you, you like that statement because you feel the same. I'm sure taking

274
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:54.979
a rest for me is a rest. Sometimes I get it. But what God is saying is that, hey, you need to

275
00:47:54.989 --> 00:48:02.780
understand that when you work on yourself, you're doing this with me. When you commit to having rest

276
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:08.860
in a newfound way, I've got something powerful that I can reveal to you and I'm ready to do that in

277
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:09.540
your life.

278
00:48:12.149 --> 00:48:18.350
And so he goes on to explain some things I want to put them on the screen here. He says, these are

279
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:27.169
the most common toxins that pollute Christian leisure today. A strong performance and work

280
00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:31.500
orientation that neglects God's grace,

281
00:48:35.669 --> 00:48:42.639
an overconsumption of goods and services that distract us from God and His creation,

282
00:48:45.159 --> 00:48:53.389
a busyness in leisure activities that prevents us from developing the qualitative dimension of

283
00:48:53.399 --> 00:48:54.100
leisure,

284
00:48:56.169 --> 00:49:05.719
an entertainment culture that overstimulates us and diverts us from finding our true refuge in God

285
00:49:05.729 --> 00:49:18.719
and His love. And then over emphasis upon competitive rather than cooperative activities organized

286
00:49:18.729 --> 00:49:30.729
rather than unstructured play and spectating rather than participating. Pretty amazing, right? It's

287
00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:36.770
a really good list. And now that I've done this, you don't have to buy one of the two books, but

288
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.739
basically, I summarized it for you.

289
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:51.870
But what this is pointing out is all the ways that we do things, the opposite of what is being said

290
00:49:51.879 --> 00:49:57.570
here we should be doing. Do you guys see that for yourselves, like sometimes like the last one that

291
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.479
we just read because the most recent in my mind is that we're spectating rather than participating.

292
00:50:02.489 --> 00:50:09.620
Well, I think rest is like, spectating, not participating. II, I think it's, it's removing myself

293
00:50:09.629 --> 00:50:14.909
but, but it's telling me to do the opposite and, and when you're an introvert that's hard to do.

294
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.379
Because what you're thinking is that the more time I spend alone, the more I'm going to recharge.

295
00:50:20.389 --> 00:50:24.469
Can I just say what a crock of stew that is?

296
00:50:27.459 --> 00:50:35.840
It is not true, not in the least. It is not something that we need to buy and, and believe and, and,

297
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:41.100
and, and, and follow in terms of advice. Listen, we all need time to recharge. I've never known an

298
00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:49.669
extrovert who also didn't need time to recharge unless they were like, you know, extremely unhealthy.

299
00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:54.969
And then we're not going to make fun of that because there are, there are reasons for that, but

300
00:50:54.979 --> 00:50:58.899
generally, even the most extroverted person needs time to recharge.

301
00:51:00.989 --> 00:51:04.479
And so we cannot give to the patterns

302
00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:09.189
of our darkness.

303
00:51:11.469 --> 00:51:16.969
We have to keep allowing God to shine his light and lead us to true rest.

304
00:51:19.399 --> 00:51:30.010
We cannot be deceived by these things. And I wanna read to you a passage in Psalm 46 and Psalm 46 10

305
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.209
says I want you to be still and know that I am God.

306
00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:41.129
And when you do this, I'm going to be honored by every nation and I'll be honored throughout the

307
00:51:41.139 --> 00:51:49.520
world. And what's really cool about this passage is that it, it's reminding us of something that we

308
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:59.520
sometimes don't understand is is that when we stop our activity, we're stopping it because we're

309
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:10.760
trying to get closer to God. When he asks us to be still, he's asking us to be in a relationship

310
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:22.080
with Him. He's asking us to prioritize that in our life. And so he's reminding us of what that is

311
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:28.429
through, what it is that we need to do. And so there's another passage and it's found

312
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.260
in the Scriptures in Exodus 34 verse 21.

313
00:52:38.479 --> 00:52:40.929
And God says, it looks like this,

314
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:50.669
you have six days each week. He says, for your ordinary work. But then he says, but on the seventh

315
00:52:50.679 --> 00:53:00.010
day, you must stop working even during, look at this, the seasons of plowing and harvest. And I look

316
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:05.300
at that and I say, God, what are you saying here? What he's saying is that even in our busiest

317
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:11.949
seasons, we still have to rest. And it's funny because I always think I gotta just push through.

318
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:17.379
It's gonna end when it does, I'll rest. Then anybody else to act like that. Think like that. Like

319
00:53:17.389 --> 00:53:22.179
when I start something, I have to finish it, I don't know my mind just, just gets targeted like that.

320
00:53:22.189 --> 00:53:28.969
And I, and I can't let it go and, and then sometimes I, I pull my wife into my craziness and she's like,

321
00:53:28.979 --> 00:53:33.290
no, I'm tired, I'm exhausted. I let's just stop. We'll do another day. I'm like, we're so close to

322
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:44.360
the end. Why would you give up now? It's like 1 a.m. Can we go to bed, please? But we're so close.

323
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:48.449
Why don't we just finish it? We don't have to deal with it tomorrow. Just push through.

324
00:53:51.409 --> 00:53:57.979
And I'm like, what is wrong with me and my mind and the way that it works sometimes, why am I

325
00:53:57.989 --> 00:54:07.669
imposing this? And yeah, that's how we can be broken. That's how I'm broken. But we can't let people

326
00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:14.760
be dragged into our Brokenness like that. And we have to stop and break the cycle of our own

327
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:23.659
Brokenness. Don't you agree? And God is saying, do you not understand how important this is that

328
00:54:23.669 --> 00:54:29.340
even in your busiest seasons, even when there is essential work that needs to be done, you still

329
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:35.600
have to rest. Listen, if you, if you don't gather the harvest, you may lose some of it. But God

330
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:41.389
saying, I'm ok with you losing some of the harvest, but I'm not ok with ever losing you.

331
00:54:45.389 --> 00:54:50.600
And, and what God does by telling us that is that I don't care about the task I care about you.

332
00:54:54.620 --> 00:55:00.510
It's not about what you're doing. It makes me love you more. You letting this go and waiting for

333
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:10.899
another time when you have more energy is ok because I love you. I care about you and I understand

334
00:55:10.909 --> 00:55:15.040
that the world doesn't work like that. You know, I understand that there's, sometimes there are

335
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:22.320
deadlines, you know, and when you're in school you can't always get an extension and when you're at

336
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:28.419
work you can't always get an extension. And when you've done a 12 hour shift, sometimes you're

337
00:55:28.429 --> 00:55:34.959
required to do another one because that's the job and you can't put that off. I get it. There are

338
00:55:34.969 --> 00:55:43.310
some things that are imposed on us. I understand that. But it doesn't mean that the next day you

339
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:51.239
can't retake control. It doesn't mean that later in the week, you can't reclaim that rest that you

340
00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:56.800
lost because someone else didn't let you have it because you just had to follow something and

341
00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:02.750
someone and directives that just didn't give you a way out. It doesn't mean that you're always

342
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:10.840
captured and captive to the cycle of not experiencing rest. That's why God is saying that even in

343
00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:19.169
seasons when there's plowing and harvesting, I want you to take it. Now, here's another one in

344
00:56:19.179 --> 00:56:26.610
Romans 12 and in verse two. And it's the last verse we're going to look at it says, don't copy the

345
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:35.820
behavior and the customs of this world. But let God transform you into a new person by changing the

346
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.580
way that you think

347
00:56:40.879 --> 00:56:43.270
and then you will learn God's will for you,

348
00:56:45.629 --> 00:56:54.270
which is good, is pleasing and it's perfect. And what I understood in my own life and I hope this

349
00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:02.949
communicates clearly to you as well. Is that until God changed the way I thought about rest? I

350
00:57:02.959 --> 00:57:09.760
didn't know what God's will was for my life. I didn't know what was good. I didn't know what was

351
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:18.659
pleasing and I certainly didn't know what was perfect because when you're not rested, your life is

352
00:57:18.669 --> 00:57:23.949
in chaos. You know what that's like, you know how your mind works. When you're in chaos, you, you

353
00:57:23.959 --> 00:57:30.340
look at your circumstances and everything is chaotic and you can't put order to the disorder. And so

354
00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:36.429
God says, I want to start somewhere and while you want me to change the circumstances of your life,

355
00:57:36.439 --> 00:57:43.000
here's what I'm going to do. First, I am going to change your thinking. I'm gonna change the way

356
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:50.540
that you see me and save your life and see rest. I'm gonna change that because if I can change that,

357
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:59.340
I can change everything from that as I would become the person in your life that you need more than

358
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:06.169
anything. And so there were three key things that we looked at today in, in this talk, I just want

359
00:58:06.179 --> 00:58:14.100
to review them real quick. That rest with this last verse is the renewing of our mind.

360
00:58:16.379 --> 00:58:31.560
Rest is the redeeming of our time and then rest is having a true integration in our life that if we

361
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:37.830
can do these three things, the way that God has been showing us and teaching us and revealing

362
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:44.040
through his scriptures, we're going to experience rest like never before and we're not going to have

363
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:52.679
to wait for a holiday, a vacation, a project to end a situation to cease circumstances to finally

364
00:58:52.689 --> 00:59:01.699
change. We can just experience that every day because God is always going to be our rest. God bless

365
00:59:01.709 --> 00:59:02.899
you guys. Thank you so much.

366
00:59:08.949 --> 00:59:18.280
Would you stand with me as we would just close this gathering? Um And we're going to have some songs

367
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:29.110
of worship here at the end are gonna prepare us. I think to hopefully just bring this message home a

368
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.709
little bit further for each of us.

369
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.360
And then once the song is um is done, I'm gonna come back out and just share some quick

370
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:40.929
announcements with you guys at the end. So just stick around for that.

371
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.129
And I just want to pray father over all of us today.

372
00:59:48.429 --> 00:59:56.449
And I know that Jesus is the one who intercedes for us, who prays for us just like he prayed for his

373
00:59:56.459 --> 01:00:05.129
disciples. He prays for us even now. Still, I look to you and I say God, you are so good and so

374
01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:13.850
faithful in spite of our inability to always do good and be faithful that your love towards us has

375
01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:20.949
never changed. And your desire to give us rest in all seasons of our life is what you have promised

376
01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.110
from the beginning of creation

377
01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:36.610
to the sending of your son Jesus. And to the teachings that Jesus and the scriptures through the

378
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:45.179
prophets and the disciples and apostles have left us to guide us in this life. I pray Lord that we

379
01:00:45.189 --> 01:00:53.310
would not be like those who go out on the seventh day and find nothing for their effort. We want to

380
01:00:53.320 --> 01:01:02.110
obey your word and, and take that season of rest and integrate it into our lives so that you are an

381
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:09.659
integral part of it so you can bless it and truly produce the rest that all of us need. I pray that

382
01:01:09.669 --> 01:01:16.110
you would begin that work in our minds today that you would continue that work in our hearts so that

383
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:23.310
we would be convinced and convicted of this truth. And then I pray God that you would also help us

384
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:34.070
to make these new patterns for our life so that we can experience this rest every day and not just

385
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:41.889
on holidays and we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Receive that over your lives. God bless you

386
01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:47.909
guys. Thank you so much. So are you guys ready to sing another song one more time? Let's do it.

387
01:01:47.919 --> 01:01:51.239
Let's give it up for the river's edge worship team and I'll be back right after that.

388
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:57.489
Uh Today, we're gonna sing this song. This is how I thank the Lord. And I just want you to keep in

389
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:03.159
mind how many things we sometimes take for granted, like breath in our lungs, waking up every day.

390
01:02:03.409 --> 01:02:09.260
So let's when we think the song. Thank thank God for his grace, his love and his mercy. Help me sing

391
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.939
the song today.

392
01:02:27.179 --> 01:02:40.290
I don't have enough work. Yes and never have enough lifetime to fully know your word, to know all

393
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.889
all of my duple.

394
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.899
And now there is no,

395
01:02:55.870 --> 01:03:00.570
you assume the best of me. And this says

396
01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:05.939
I was waiting.

397
01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:08.770
This is why

398
01:03:16.139 --> 01:03:17.729
all of my effects

399
01:03:20.159 --> 01:03:22.489
everything I have to give

400
01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:25.300
of my

401
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.149
in town.

402
01:03:53.889 --> 01:03:57.419
I think I will sing. This is how

403
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:00.600
everything

404
01:04:05.189 --> 01:04:07.439
I was was.

405
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.840
I was, I will see

406
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.139
I was,

407
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.370
I was,

408
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:38.239
this is

409
01:04:57.959 --> 01:04:58.229
Mhm

410
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:02.800
And this is how

411
01:05:22.969 --> 01:05:23.560
tell us,

412
01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:43.100
hey, if you could just be seated for a second, I'm just gonna share some quick announcements with

413
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:50.219
you. And um the first one is that um our kids program is back next Sunday at 10 30. Our youth

414
01:05:50.229 --> 01:05:57.340
program is back at 10 a.m. So I want to remind you of those two things and then we also have our

415
01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:04.800
after party which is going to be back next Sunday that after party, uh we asked for volunteers to

416
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:10.580
step up and to be a part of that team. I just want to thank you guys for, for doing that. Um We have

417
01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:14.419
now 15 team members for the cafe. So that's amazing. It's great

418
01:06:17.989 --> 01:06:23.739
and we've got great news uh to also announce is that we are have now a prayer ministry back in place

419
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:29.229
on Sundays. We've always had a prayer meeting and a prayer group on Wednesdays, we have other ones

420
01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:35.760
that meet online, but we wanted to reestablish this prayer ministry on Sundays. And so this coming

421
01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:43.570
Sunday, September 10th, uh we have prayer partners that are gonna be available at the end of every

422
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:49.290
gathering. They're gonna be in pairs of two because that's usually what a prayer is. I don't know

423
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:54.830
why I said it like that. And there's gonna be a table uh set up there with some bibles and to track

424
01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.669
some information that you might need to help you in your spiritual journey as well. And they're

425
01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:04.290
gonna be able to pray for you, direct you uh to your next steps if that's what you're looking for.

426
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:08.550
But if you just want someone to just pray for you and sometimes you want that prayer to be anonymous,

427
01:07:08.909 --> 01:07:13.320
you can just say, can you just pray for me without even saying what it's about? And they will do

428
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:20.320
that. And then if you want someone to continue to pray for you, even after the Sunday is, is passed,

429
01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:26.080
well, you can fill out a prayer card and that card will be available to go to our prayer team and

430
01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:30.919
they will keep praying until they hear back from you. So please let them know they can stop praying

431
01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:38.189
because they will keep praying until you have your breakthrough and that's how it's gonna work. And

432
01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:40.449
so are you excited for that, starting next Sunday?

433
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:49.040
And we've got a few more announcements to make in the weeks to come. But right now, I just want to

434
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:53.419
direct you guys to the giving and sometimes giving doesn't feel like worship. It feels like an

435
01:07:53.429 --> 01:08:00.370
obligation. It feels like, you know, why do I gotta do that? My life is already hard enough. But

436
01:08:00.379 --> 01:08:06.530
when you understand that God is the greatest gift and he is the one who keeps giving you the ability

437
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:13.689
to give and wants to increase your capacity to be generous so that He can be even more generous in

438
01:08:13.699 --> 01:08:21.648
your life. You never think about giving ever the same way again. When you understand these

439
01:08:21.659 --> 01:08:25.719
principles, your life gets blessed in a way that you could never have imagined. It's not always

440
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:30.409
material. Sometimes it's just spiritual. Sometimes it's the breakthroughs in the areas of your life

441
01:08:30.418 --> 01:08:34.539
where you need it most and it has nothing to do with money. It has everything to do with

442
01:08:34.548 --> 01:08:38.818
relationships or it has something more to do with that inner healing that you need it. And you don't

443
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:45.009
think it's connected. You don't think it's related, but it always all ways is everything is

444
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.609
connected with God. It's interconnected and so whatever you do, whatever you can give, however you

445
01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.620
can be generous. Thank you for that because you're not giving to us, you're giving to the Lord first

446
01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:59.299
and foremost, and when you get to him, he's the one who blesses you in return. So, thank you for

447
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:05.720
that. And we are excited about starting a new season of belong groups. It's gonna be our small group

448
01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:11.778
ministry and uh we are looking to build this up even more. We want to see more people in groups and

449
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:15.398
that means we're going to need some people that want to step up and say I want to lead a group. I

450
01:09:15.409 --> 01:09:20.749
want to host one. I'd love to get together with people. I can't do it in person, but I can do it

451
01:09:20.758 --> 01:09:26.269
online, whatever it is that you can do. I would love to hear from you. And in the weeks to come,

452
01:09:26.278 --> 01:09:31.600
we're going to have sign ups for that and we're gonna see uh the numbers of groups that we have here

453
01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:37.169
at our church increase. So we have 14 groups that are meeting right now. We want to see that number

454
01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:41.240
increase. I don't know what the number should be. I just know that we need more of them because

455
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:45.910
people are always looking to join groups and we don't always have where to send them. And sometimes

456
01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:50.220
people sign up for stuff and then don't follow through and sometimes they don't show up and

457
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:55.200
sometimes they, that's life. Sometimes it's ok and it can be disappointing if you lead a group and

458
01:09:55.209 --> 01:10:00.549
sometimes host a group when people are not as faithful to it as you are. But remember that when we

459
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:08.089
create spaces for others again, we're making room for God and, and when we make room for God and put

460
01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:15.399
him first, God blesses you for that initiative, for that sacrifice, for that commitment. You wanting

461
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:20.330
to journey with other people is gonna make a big difference in someone's life. And even if it isn't

462
01:10:20.339 --> 01:10:25.580
a lot of people attending, even if it's just one or two or three, well, it's making a change. That

463
01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:30.859
is a lasting one and God is gonna bless them and bless you for it. So think about that in the weeks

464
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:35.700
to come as we make these announcements and uh we're here for you. We look forward to being able to

465
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:42.399
see this church continue to grow and move forward and it's amazing to see this many people on, on

466
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:47.930
Labor Day weekend. Are you guys shocked too? I'm a little surprised. It's amazing. Thank you. And so

467
01:10:47.939 --> 01:10:53.200
there's a shift. God is blessing. God is increasing our numbers. I see that and it's not just about

468
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:57.209
that. It's about, I think the community that we're building. I think God is honoring that. So God

469
01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:02.680
bless you guys. Have a great Sunday. Thank you Vito. And we just want to pray that God continues to

470
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:06.520
bless us in Jesus. The dog's name is Vito, by the way,

471
01:11:09.259 --> 01:11:15.450
God bless you guys have a great Sunday. Stick around, hang out just with each other. Even if you

472
01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:17.600
don't have anything to drink or eat. See you guys, God bless you.
