00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:43.789
Can you hear me now?

2
00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:50.390
We're thankful for Tech

3
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.380
Happy Thanksgiving River.

4
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:07.530
Welcome again. Welcome to everyone on the line. Um What we're doing today is we are giving thanks to

5
00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:13.489
God for everything that we appreciate. We're welcoming all of you and everyone online and we're

6
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.840
gonna pray for Pastor Lorenzo who cannot be here with us today because he's with our mosaic family

7
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:25.570
and we just pray that he has safe travels on his way back to Montreal um for families today. This is

8
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.880
a family service. So we're gonna keep the kids with us. Um However, there is an activity room that

9
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.619
has been set up. So if little people are a little bit rowdy, please parents feel free to take them

10
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:41.659
to the back for activities and coloring that have been set up for them. So let's stand up, let's

11
00:09:41.669 --> 00:09:48.080
posture our hearts to give thanks for God for everything that he is doing in us and through us. And

12
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:54.020
we're gonna have some worship with our team. I think she thank you.

13
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:09.400
No. Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. Everyone. I wanna start by reading psalms 103. Oh my soul bless God from

14
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:17.450
head to toe. I'll bless his holy name. Oh my soul bless God. Don't forget a single blessing. He

15
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:25.969
forgives your sins. Everyone, he heals your diseases. Everyone he redeems you from hell. Saves your

16
00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:35.849
life. He crowns you with love and mercy. A paradise crown. He wraps you in goodness beauty, eternal.

17
00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:44.590
He renews your youth. You're always young in his presence. God makes everything come out right? He

18
00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:52.489
puts victims back on their feet. He showed Moses how he went about his work, opened up his plans to

19
00:10:52.500 --> 00:11:01.619
all of Israel. God is sheer mercy. He is sheer grace, not easily angered. He's rich in love. He

20
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:09.869
doesn't endlessly nag and scold nor hold grudges forever. He doesn't treat us as our sins deserve

21
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:19.659
nor pay us back in full for our wrongs as high as heaven is over the earth. So strong is his love to

22
00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:29.140
those who fear him. And as far as sunrise is from sunset, he has separated us from our sins as

23
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:37.130
parents feel for their Children. God feels to those who fear Him. He knows us inside out keeps in

24
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:43.719
mind that we're made of mud. Men and women don't live very long like wild flowers. They spring up in

25
00:11:43.729 --> 00:11:50.760
blossom, but a storm snuffs them out just as quickly leaving nothing to show they were here. God's

26
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:59.729
love though is ever and always eternally present to all who fear Him, making everything right for

27
00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:07.909
them and their Children as they follow his covenant ways and remember to do whatever he said, God

28
00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:17.489
has set his throne in heaven. He rules over us all. He's the king. So bless God. You angels ready

29
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:24.030
and able to fly His bidding quick to hear and do what he says. Bless God. All you armies of angels

30
00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:31.030
alert to respond to whatever He wills, bless God, all creatures, wherever you are everything and

31
00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:44.159
everyone made by God and you o my soul. bless God. Amen. We're gonna sing God so loved sing with us.

32
00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:08.169

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:34.619
we're gonna announce today is we still have the sign ups for volunteers. We're still recruiting, we

138
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:40.829
still always need help. So if there's an area of this service of this community that you would like

139
00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:47.500
to lend a helping hand to. We would welcome you. So the sign ups are in the back. Um I'd like to

140
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:53.069
turn our attention to our connection team. Were you well greeted this morning by Rob and Natalie at

141
00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:53.780
the back?

142
00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:02.420
Yes. So that's a new ministry we're firing up again. So be sure to say hi to them on your way out as

143
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:11.239
well. Um Secondly, on the docket, Thanksgiving brunch will be next weekend. So we get a double

144
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:17.250
portion of Thanksgiving. So please, after the service on Sunday the 15th, next Sunday, we're gonna

145
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:23.089
gather together at the back of the church community kitchen is going to be serving us a wonderful

146
00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:29.619
Thanksgiving brunch so that we can stay and get to know people and get to know the people that we

147
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.630
know better. Um But it's a big part of our community, the, the brunches that we have on a regular

148
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:44.439
basis. So we encourage you to stick around. We have a women's ministry event coming up on October

149
00:30:44.449 --> 00:30:53.790
the 21st. It's Saturday from 3 to 5 p.m. And um we hope to see all of you ladies there. We've been

150
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:59.810
having a great time. Patricia has been leading and we're blessed to have her and her volunteering at

151
00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:07.430
this ministry. It's blessed and we're learning about women of God and unlikely royalty and where we

152
00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:15.400
stand in God's kingdom. So I would encourage you to come October 21st 3 to 5 p.m. here at River's

153
00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:26.189
Edge. We have a worship night coming up October 27th here at the church at 7 p.m. And this is not

154
00:31:26.199 --> 00:31:34.000
just any worship night. This is actually a fundraiser for Anawim, which is Patricia's Ministry

155
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:40.119
abroad and we are collecting donations that night. We're suggesting a donation of $20 but of course,

156
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:45.319
you can give what's on your heart. We have a team that's leaving from River Edge that are going to

157
00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:53.739
be serving in Madagascar Tanzania. She has a ministry in Sri Lanka and she is blessing people with

158
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:59.420
her ministry all over the world. God is with her. And we're asking people to come out on the 27th to

159
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:06.069
support her and what God is doing in the world. And finally, we have four ways to give. So thank you

160
00:32:06.079 --> 00:32:12.260
very much for your donations already. We appreciate it and they go to support ministries like

161
00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:18.910
Anawim um and what we do for the community here and in Montreal. And so that does take funding. It

162
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:25.270
is helpful. It's a mission of ours to connect with those outside of river's edge and to provide

163
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.130
ministries for our community here. So we thank you in advance and we ask that you just give whatever

164
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:36.630
God puts on your heart. So let's again, posture our hearts and get ready to hear a word from Pastor

165
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.229
Lorenzo online.

166
00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:56.140
Hey, this is Thanksgiving Sunday and I'm so glad that you could be a part of this. Today's message

167
00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:02.290
is called praise is power. And we're gonna be looking at Psalm 103 the Psalm of David. And we begin

168
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:08.489
at verse one and it says, let all that I am praise the Lord with my whole heart. I will praise his

169
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:15.060
holy name. Let all that I am praise the Lord. May I never forget the good things that he does for me.

170
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:22.969
He forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases. He redeems me from death and he crowns me with

171
00:33:22.979 --> 00:33:31.030
love and tender mercies. He fills my life with good things. My youth is renewed like the eagles, the

172
00:33:31.234 --> 00:33:38.694
gives righteousness and justice to all who are treated unfairly. Well, today, we're gonna celebrate

173
00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:46.214
Thanksgiving. It's great that one day is set aside to remember how important this is for us to do

174
00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:53.655
every day. And that's what the Psalm does. It instructs us to be thankful and what to be thankful

175
00:33:53.665 --> 00:34:00.189
for. When David wrote this, he was in a season in his life, in which he understood that no matter

176
00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:05.829
what he was going through, he needed to thank the Lord and count his blessings. Well, that's the

177
00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:13.209
instruction that we received today that all of us need to praise the Lord with our whole hearts and

178
00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:18.459
praise his holy name, that whatever the thing is that is in front of us, whatever it is that we're

179
00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:24.290
going through that we may never forget the good things that the Lord has already done for us.

180
00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:30.870
There's nothing here but praise to God, no request, no petitions, no pleas. In this prayer. David

181
00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:36.580
was counting his blessings instead of counting his complaints. And you all know how good we can be

182
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:44.070
at complaining. But he realized how good God was and how undeserving he was, his undeserving meant

183
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.830
that he knew that he was loved, blessed and favored by God and that he did nothing to deserve it. So

184
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:56.540
he praised him and he counted the ways in which he recognized it. He described what they were. David

185
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.760
was an accomplished musician and singer and it was joyous for him to praise the Lord. That may not

186
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:08.459
be you, that may not always be me. But you don't have to be like David to praise. You just need for

187
00:35:08.469 --> 00:35:15.689
it to be authentic and heartfelt. And so when we come before God and we praise Him, we just need to

188
00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:21.290
be ourselves. We need to be real. We all have things that we can look back on. All of us have things

189
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:27.820
that we can be grateful for things that we can give him. Thanksgiving for today.

190
00:35:33.889 --> 00:35:41.320
I have no silver, I have no cookies. I have no food. All I can offer you is Jesus. That's it. And

191
00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:46.479
the second thing I want to talk to you about in Psalm 103 is that your relationship with God is

192
00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:52.800
actually very whole and healthy more than you realize in fact, you can be incredibly thankful and

193
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:59.040
grateful for this very thing. The Bible tells us in verse three that He forgives all my sins and he

194
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:04.560
heals all of my diseases. And what we learn from this passage is that there's already so much that

195
00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:10.320
we can be thankful for. And so as we think about this day and what it means and how we need to be

196
00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:14.709
thankful and grateful in the presence of God that there are things that He has already forgiven us

197
00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:20.949
of. There are things that He has healed us of, but there's others that need to still be dealt with.

198
00:36:21.409 --> 00:36:27.360
And one of Satan's names is accuser. And we learned that in the book of job that he goes before God

199
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:36.469
and, and that God interacts with Satan about job and God was clearly very proud of Him. I don't know

200
00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:44.080
if you feel if, if God is proud of you or that you feel that God can be proud of you. You see, it

201
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:50.919
doesn't say that Satan lies about us when he goes into the presence of God that wouldn't be allowed,

202
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:57.409
even though He is the father of lies. It says that he accuses us and that Satan doesn't need to lie

203
00:36:57.419 --> 00:37:06.719
because we give him more than enough for Him to be truthful about how bad we can actually be when he

204
00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:14.310
goes into the presence of God. But what God does is that He makes sure that Satan isn't the only one

205
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:21.409
who's present. It's not just the accuser that is there. So even though Satan is our adversary, we

206
00:37:21.419 --> 00:37:30.030
also have in Jesus, our advocate. And when Satan accuses us, know this, Jesus is present to defend

207
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:37.219
us, he's there to defend you and he raises his nail pierced hands and he says the debt is paid no

208
00:37:37.229 --> 00:37:45.149
matter what the accusation is. Jesus has already paid for it and he's already not only delivered you

209
00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:51.500
from the sins, but He has healed you from any of those things that brought disease into your life.

210
00:37:51.949 --> 00:38:00.139
Now, David understood that God's forgiveness applied to his sins and that his healing was for and

211
00:38:00.149 --> 00:38:07.540
from the effects that cause disease to form in our minds, in our hearts and in our bodies. Let God

212
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:16.530
be your healer today that even if you have fear, doubt, depression, anger, lust, hate, jealousy,

213
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:24.469
envy, pride, and greed. These and many more are the diseases that God wants to heal us of. And

214
00:38:24.479 --> 00:38:33.810
that's what we can be grateful for today. In Psalm 147 verse three, it says that He heals the broken

215
00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:40.580
hearted and He binds up their wounds. Will you trust God for that today? Will you believe that He

216
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:47.929
can do this? Will you turn to Him with gratitude and with Thanksgiving, will this Psalm become your

217
00:38:47.939 --> 00:38:54.830
song? The third thing I want to talk to you about is how your relationship with God is meaningful.

218
00:38:55.189 --> 00:39:02.750
And we're going to take a look at the verse four and read till verse six, what it tells us.

219
00:39:06.129 --> 00:39:11.790
And so the other thing I wanted to talk to you about in this psalm 103 is that our relationship with

220
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:19.149
God has to be meaningful. Verses four through to six, say that he redeemed me from death and he

221
00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:24.040
crowns me with love and tender mercies. He fills my life with good things. My youth is renewed like

222
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:30.850
the eagles and that the Lord gives righteousness and justice to all those who are treated unfairly

223
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.870
well, because He forgives heals and gives us relationship. We have meaning in this life and our

224
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:45.790
lives are kept from being wasted. God keeps your life from being wasted. See the pursuit of things

225
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:52.709
that are temporary. Those things we already know, don't matter, but yet we pursue them anyways. And

226
00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:57.709
so I feel like we have to look at this passage and then just remember that there are some things

227
00:39:57.719 --> 00:40:04.360
here that refer to what it looks like to live a meaningful life. Well, the first thing is that we

228
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:11.860
have to be grateful that nothing encourages praise like gratitude. The second thing is that we have

229
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:19.225
to be vocal, you need to sing and shout his praises so that you are reminded. But so that also

230
00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:26.854
others know of His faithfulness, be authentic. Praise God in the manner that is real and most

231
00:40:26.864 --> 00:40:31.975
authentic for you. Be consistent, make it a part of your every day. Because your goal is to praise

232
00:40:31.985 --> 00:40:39.395
God with everything every day. And that means attitudes, actions, family, friends, finances, words,

233
00:40:39.405 --> 00:40:45.310
work, religion, relationships, your voice, your vocation, your Children, your spouse, your hobbies,

234
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:52.790
your habits. And yes, even your church. Let's consider how we have experienced forgiveness and

235
00:40:52.800 --> 00:41:00.510
continue to live in God's faithfulness and his favor on this thanksgiving. Let us give thanks, God

236
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:11.820
bless you, bless your life. And may we rejoice together that God has redeemed us and he is renewing

237
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:19.189
us for us to be thankful every day. Praise is the power that we need on this Thanksgiving Sunday.

238
00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:22.070
God bless you and I pray that this word encourages you.

239
00:41:28.729 --> 00:41:34.090
We're going to sing the song about gratitude. Just what Pastor Lorenzo was talking about and all we

240
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.250
can give to God is our gratitude and our Thanksgiving.

241
00:41:57.469 --> 00:41:59.860
All my words fall short.

242
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:02.479
I

243
00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:13.479
attitude

244
00:42:15.919 --> 00:42:17.530
I could sing the

245
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:20.780
and

246
00:42:25.389 --> 00:42:25.830
there is

247
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.629
so I throw up my hands, praise you again. And

248
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.320
all that I have is

249
00:42:53.219 --> 00:42:55.550
I know it but I'm

250
00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:58.310
or a kid

251
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.889
for a heart singing.

252
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:20.959
I do.

253
00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:26.929
Yeah,

254
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.149
I'm crazy

255
00:43:56.959 --> 00:43:57.929
bit more.

256
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.540
Except for a heart singing.

257
00:44:16.729 --> 00:44:25.479
I'm gonna sing. Come on my soul and sing this together. Come my soul. Don't you get shy on me and

258
00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:29.179
lift up your song because you are a lie.

259
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.080
Get up and praise the Lord.

260
00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:38.239
Yeah.

261
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:47.060
So don't you get shy on me to lift up your song. God

262
00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:37.969
praise you

263
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.780
because all that I had

264
00:45:53.500 --> 00:46:04.330
and I know it's not much but I'm has been for, hey, except for a horse singing.

265
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:29.280
We give you all our gratitude. Thank you Lord. And now we know God is so good. So we're gonna sing

266

and then the service with a wonderful up. I want to see you clapping and jumping. We're gonna sing.
