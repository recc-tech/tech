00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.710
...that's really a good way to do some economy on our electricity bills. Having said that, did someone

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.070
get hurt in the stairs this morning? No hand in the air. Perfect. Because of what? Because of Mike

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.140
and Peter. Let's clap for them.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.190
Nice job of de-icing everything. So thank you guys. Um, okay, so I really wanted to wish you a warm

5
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:39.830
welcome this morning and we're still in that beginning of the year and that new series called Don't

6
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.920
Waste Your Past. And so that series will continue today in the next couple of weeks as well. But

7
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.500
just before, also that beginning of the series, we will also have some worship song that will sing

8
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.450
all together. That will be another opportunity to exercise ourselves. Obviously we want you to be

9
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.350
really welcome here no matter where you are in your spiritual journey, even if you're not thinking

10
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.440
that your spiritual adult, even if you're thinking that you're only a matter of well being, it's

11
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.750
perfectly okay. We'll all journey together and we're all at different level and we really want you

12
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.990
to be welcome talk. Talking about being welcomed today. There's a meal that's going to be served and

13
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.980
that meal is for everyone. So you're really welcome to stay with us at noon and enjoy that meal

14
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.270
together as a community. So don't be embarrassed to share that meal together and to be part of that

15
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.230
community, as I mentioned earlier, you are welcome to belong before you believe so right now, can

16
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.720
you stand up with me. Okay, As we do some exercise balance and it's really, it's something that we

17
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.520
introduced this year we want to introduce. It's just to be able to diagnose people that may need an

18
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.490
ambulance in the worship time. So just want to see kind of what shape you are. So let's try to stand

19
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:17.070
on one on one leg like this. Okay. Okay. Oh, it seems difficult. So I'm really worried. So we always

20
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.100
have a nurse here. So yeah, so we'll just make sure to be a little bit more proactive. So just try

21
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.830
to maybe raise your hand like a hand like this. Is this working a little bit better? Okay, great few.

22
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.000
I was really worried. Let's try the other side. So, okay, you're giving me faith so perfect. They're

23
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.810
really tough shape. So can we welcome our worship team this morning? Thank you so much.

24
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.230
Let's stand up and praise God and tell him how good he is.

29
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.570
Thank you Lord for being here being with us here. We thank you so much. And we know that you are here

30
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.520
with us and we are not afraid, not afraid at all.

47
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:46.800
We're gonna get ready to sing a brand new song called "God Really Loves Us." It'll just blow you away

48
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:52.440
with the words and just the realization of how much God truly loves us.

60
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.120
Thank you so much.

61
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.000
You may be seated.

62
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.410
Such a great team and thank you guys for that incredible time of worship.

63
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.040
I just want to present to you Talita Bitencourt, could you welcome her to the stage and

64
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:57.190
and Thalita is gonna be our new kids and youth ministry coordinator and so today she's helping us get

65
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:04.150
people to sign up to serve in our kids ministry program. And so whether you want to serve in the

66
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:12.460
nursery or in the grade school from kindergarten to grade four or grade five and six or high school

67
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:20.660
age from grade seven to grade 11, then you need to see Thalita this morning and so we'll have a

68
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:27.830
great opportunity um and an extended time at the end of this gathering to share a meal together. So

69
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:34.110
at any point if you just even want to come by and just say hi to her, introduce yourself, especially

70
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:40.680
if you're a parent or a grandparent and you have kids that sometimes make it uh with you to church,

71
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:46.360
even if it isn't on a week to week basis and you want to know more about how they can be involved

72
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.600
and how they can help and how they can support, then please go and speak to Thalita. And if you want

73
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.930
to encourage her or just bless her for taking on such an important and vital role at our community

74
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:04.570
of faith, we really want to see our kids and youth ministry thrive. Do you guys agree with that? And

75
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:11.040
so this is another big step going in that direction and having someone who's going to be dedicated

76
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.630
towards that end and helping us on a week to week basis and making sure that everything goes

77
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.570
smoothly, we already thank our teachers, the ones that are already involved and who have been Just

78
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:28.510
holding the ministry up since we've come back from the pandemic. Uh, and we have about 13 people in

79
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:37.820
the team so far, but we need double that number so that people can just rotate on a basis. That

80
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:45.820
makes more sense in terms of what a volunteer can do on a week to week basis. And so if you'd like

81
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:52.550
to serve once a once a week, once a month, I mean, or twice a month, there's a big difference in

82
00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:57.860
that. Right? And so the more people we have, the later, the load and the more consistency we can

83
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:03.770
provide and especially if something comes up, sometimes it's the same teacher who just taught the

84
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:08.880
week before, who has to fill in for the person who can't make it and so we need more people. And so

85
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.860
if you think you can handle one time a month or once, even every two months, depending on how many

86
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:21.680
teachers we get then please see Talita sounds good. Yeah, I appreciate that so much and we're just

87
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.180
going to pray for her right now. Thank you father for our ministry team and for our kids ministry

88
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.010
and youth ministry, our teachers and now we pray for our coordinator. We thank you Lord for your

89
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:37.220
hand upon her life and the work that she's going to do to build this ministry to recruit people that

90
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:43.170
are going to serve and to also lead the teams and we just thank you for that in Jesus name. Amen,

91
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.250
Amen God bless you Thalita.

92
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.470
So we've been in the last couple of weeks in a fundraiser for a community hall. Let's watch this

93
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.340
video in case you haven't seen it. If you have, you're gonna see it twice. Here we go,

94
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:07.060
Hay River's Edge. It's a beautiful January winter uh here in our city and I wanted to just introduce

95
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:12.960
our community hall and this is the way that our guests would be coming in so obviously you can also

96
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:19.860
access the community hall from inside the building, but on a normal Monday or Thursday, any day of

97
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.520
the week really, whenever we have activities going on, this would be the door that everyone would

98
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:24.950
use.

99
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:33.940
So we've got this great wide entrance that's gonna be painted, these steps are gonna be secured and

100
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:41.370
we now have a vestibule that's been built to keep the cold air out and this cold air won't make its

101
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:47.530
way into the community hall. This is the big space that we have been working on, we took down the

102
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:56.610
ceiling, demoed all the walls, we have new insulation, new lighting, it's all new electrical, these

103
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:03.770
are all LED lights that are installed, new sprinkler system and we have to now get to the finishing

104
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:09.350
stages of this room and that's what the fundraiser is all about. Hi, I'm jesse Brassard, I'm gonna

105
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:15.930
be the contractor working here, starting off with the open space that Lorenzo showed you here the

106
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.510
dining area for the soup kitchen and we're gonna be painting it, finishing up some plastering and

107
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.300
it's not just this space that you're looking at right here, this large room where we can accommodate

108
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:33.400
so many activities ministries and groups. But this space right here which is outside of our

109
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.900
industrial kitchen.

110
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:50.000
So this space here serves as a secondary meeting area and dining room and we have two new washrooms

111
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.200
that are being put in, they've been doubled in capacity. We're looking at adding showers, but that's

112
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:03.720
gonna be a second phase for right now, we are gonna make, those washrooms functional, but we are

113
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:10.800
going to then renovate those completely and that'll be phase two of this project, Let me show you

114
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.490
phase three,

115
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:22.430
So this is Phase three, this is going to be our youth and young adult hangout space. This is a large

116
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:29.270
room that can be accommodating all of our youth and young adults where we're gonna have games set up

117
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:36.790
and couches and beanbags and that kind of thing. And that space goes into this space as well, so

118
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:44.450
it's double the size that you're seeing right now. This is the second space that would be used by

119
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:52.320
the youth and young adults as well. So we'd have two whole areas dedicated just for them. So this

120
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:58.270
would be phase three. So the first phase is really just a community hall and we're just trying to

121
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:03.710
raise $15,000 for that. Once we've completed that, we're gonna work on the washrooms, that's phase

122
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:09.260
two, we'll update you once we've collected the first amount what that's gonna cost and then this

123
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.040
will be phase three and there'll be another amount that we need to raise to finish this off. Once

124
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:21.180
we've done all three phases, it's done all of this is complete community kitchen, all of our youth

125
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:27.920
young adult ministries as well as our kids ministries as well as our daycare. Can now make full use

126
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:33.520
of this space and it's gonna be a huge benefit, not just to us, but to all the community groups that

127
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:40.380
meet on a week to week basis. We have so many groups that need space, and it gives us an opportunity

128
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:46.950
to also give it out for free, but also to be able to add revenue to our church by renting it out.

129
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.260
What's different about this space is that we can now access it from upstairs, so we had to cut

130
00:22:53.270 --> 00:23:01.400
through this wall. So, what this means now is that when we come through here, we can access the

131
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:10.960
upstairs as well as when we come down these stairs, we can now make our way back into the community

132
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:17.980
hall, just excited to be part of this. Um you know, it'll be exciting to see it finished and have

133
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.090
people in this space, you know, not just be something that's waiting to be done, but something that

134
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:30.910
is done and has, you know, outreach to the community and potential extra events and income for the

135
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:38.230
church. So what a great space. And I know that we're already off and running in terms of the money

136
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:43.450
that we've been trying to collect, and we hope that in the next few weeks we can raise the rest,

137
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:49.200
it's not a huge amount, if we all chip in, we can get this done, they're ready to start working next

138
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:57.800
week, and this is it, this place will be ready to go by February at some point. So what a great

139
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.770
thing for the community kitchen to have its space back to be able to offer its ministries again, and

140
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:07.930
for all of us to be able to have this space for all the other ministries activities and programs

141
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.440
that we have. God bless you guys. Thank you so much for supporting.

142
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:36.300
So, good morning again. And for those who just arrive, just want to wish you a warm and super

143
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:43.210
wonderful, Happy New Year. We can wish happy New Year until Easter, that's the rule. So and it's

144
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:49.200
usually at that point that I'm removing also my Halloween decorations, so it coins side everything

145
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.880
together. Okay, Halloween decoration and stopping saying Happy New Year Christmas decoration.

146
00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:01.080
Obviously we're waiting to July for the Christmas camp are so campaign Christmases, I don't know if

147
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.980
the right translation but you follow me for those who aren't following me right now, No problem.

148
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.710
We're working on the subtitle, that's going to be on the slide. That's gonna be just explaining

149
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:22.780
slowly in more understanding, being boy comprehensible word and understanding generally language,

150
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.580
wow

151
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.520
well, I know, wow, I'm really already ready to go to heaven.

152
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:42.340
I feel so close to God right now. Okay, okay, so about the raising that we're doing right now. So

153
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:50.760
it's been two weeks and we're looking for the objectives of 15,000. So the amount that we've been

154
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:57.880
able to raise so far is 9615 I'm sitting now.

155
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.390
So that's that's really good. We really want to thank you for your generosity and and also that we

156
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.970
always need to find the right balance in the regular offering that needs to pay for the heating that

157
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:19.460
I was talking earlier and all the expenses and also being able to have that money aside to be able

158
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:26.540
to do the renovation. So please continue to give and if we're being able to even access this goal

159
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:32.620
that will be even better for that beginning of the year where is typically a little bit difficult

160
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:41.200
and trying also to compensate for last year, also offerings and close everything and be able to meet

161
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:47.410
our engagement. So thank you for your generosity. That's really amazing and we're really happy.

162
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.290
They're still two weeks remaining. So please continue to give generously and talking about giving

163
00:26:53.290 --> 00:27:00.380
generously and I know I'm I'm changing a bit the order, but there's four ways to give. So please

164
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:07.000
don't hesitate. You can go on the website, you can use the super pOS machine that are at the back

165
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:16.030
here. So please don't hesitate to use these methods to give. So today, and there's the community

169
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:39.420

Okay, please stay with us, enjoy that meal and thank you so much for the community kitchen team.

Excellent. So that was the major announcement. If I haven't forgot something, did I forget something

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:08.040
community kitchen for ways to give and the dismissed the kids, Thank you so much. Oh, so thank you

174
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:14.870
for Thalita. Also, that is stepping, stepping up right now and Lorenzo will talk about also Caroli that

175
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:23.330
took the lead in the past. So kids, let's look at that video and you're welcome to reach the check

176
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:31.540
in at the back here to have a wonderful class prepare for you. And we'll look at that video right

177
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.090
now.

178
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:15.280
Excellent. So as I mentioned earlier, we'll have a wonderful message prepared by Lorenzo. So please

179
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.760
let's welcome him.

180
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:36.440
Did you feel that something just happened that many of us take for granted another year is

181
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:44.920
officially in the past. A chapter is closed and now we look ahead to a new year. The mistakes

182
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:53.730
missteps and missed opportunities of the past give way to hope, excitement and joy for the new life.

183
00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:01.750
God gives us pursuing Christ with each new dawn through his grace. We get the chance to reset the

184
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:10.690
clock to forget what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead as we work. Play rest and

185
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:17.800
worship. We know his mercies are new every morning. Those who hope in the Lord will renew their

186
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:26.460
strength arriving at next year's end through his faithfulness. So whatever we do this year, let's

187
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:34.550
give it to God seeking his will, trusting his plan and taking this opportunity to restart

188
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:48.170
things in this new year. And before we continue, I just wanted to do some things. I completely

189
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:55.550
forgot when I was introducing Thalita that I wanted to also thank Caroli, who was our ministry

190
00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:01.050
coordinator and all the work that she did over the course of the last couple of years and just

191
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:07.070
helping us maintain our kids ministry. So Caroli thank you so much. Would you just wave?

192
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:22.410
Yeah, it's really well, well deserved. She did so much and uh and we really appreciate her. So I

193
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:29.940
wanted to also just say to you that today we are going to look at this topic in a way that I think

194
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:36.920
is going to be refreshing for all of us. I'm going to talk to you about what it looks like to not

195
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:47.970
waste our past, but more importantly to be sometimes forced to return to a place that we had left

196
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:57.710
behind for good. One of the difficulties in our lives is just being able to accept the fact that God

197
00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:06.780
doesn't let us waste our past. Doesn't let us just move away from it, leaving things behind in it

198
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:14.550
until they have been dealt with to a level and to a degree that the Holy Spirit himself releases us

199
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:23.840
from when we are doing the hard work of dealing with what has happened in our past. I want us to

200
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.140
look at this year and imagine that it's going to be a year filled with promise that it's a year

201
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:37.180
filled with hope, that it's one that is filled with an expectation of a God who loves us and who is

202
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:45.970
with us and who is for us and is going to help us experience and achieve great things. It's not

203
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:54.020
always easy to have that framework in our minds and in our lives and sometimes the discipline to put

204
00:32:54.030 --> 00:33:00.320
the boundaries and the parameters in place, to experience it on a day to day basis. But if we can

205
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.100
start from the fact that God wants this for us and that even when we are in the struggles of this

206
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:12.560
life and we are being challenged and we don't see things working out and we are in the wilderness of

207
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:20.590
the waiting, then we can nonetheless look to God and say, I still believe in the promise that you

208
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:27.840
have given me. When we look at particularly some characters in the Bible, we see them as being well

209
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:34.470
more blessed than others. We see them having the favor of God more than someone else and well,

210
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:42.450
they've been chosen for a specific purpose. There's a plan that God has and he needs these people to

211
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:49.410
enact that plan so that God can fulfill his purpose and sometimes the person who's asked is

212
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:56.790
unwilling, they're reluctant, they're afraid. They look at their shortcomings and very often they

213
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:02.700
are looking at their past and when they look at their past, they say, I can't do this and hear all

214
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:08.810
the reasons why. And whether you believe this or not, I want you to know that Moses was that person

215
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:18.430
Moses was someone who believed strongly that he could not ever return to his past. In fact, he fled

216
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:26.300
from it. And so what I want us to look at today in terms of the life of Moses is what is actually

217
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:35.070
required for the promise in our lives to be fulfilled. Like what needs to happen. So that I too can

218
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:44.620
inherit the promise of God, that my life can be blessed that my life can see those great things that

219
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:56.950
I hope for and believe God for and hear him remind me of in the scriptures, Moses was forced to

220
00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:06.630
return and yet Moses left Egypt in fear. But now God is saying you have to return in faith, you

221
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:14.100
couldn't do it before. But I'm telling you, you have to do it now before. You wanted to do things in

222
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:20.460
my name and by your hand and in your strength and you went about it the wrong way and you never

223
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:28.000
really felt wanted, not by the Israelites the hebrews and not by the Egyptians, your adopted foster

224
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.650
family and as a result, you never imagined that you felt in either world. So you left to go and

225
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:44.470
create a world of your own. You went to a place so that you could start over and leave everything

226
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:52.050
behind. Did you ever do that? Just leave everything behind. Leave the people who might have raised

227
00:35:52.050 --> 00:36:00.970
you, leave the things that you had a link to in the past with and just felt like this stuff is all

228
00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:07.750
gonna stay in the past, it's not going to come with me, Moses did exactly that. And he went and he

229
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:16.120
found himself his own family to start with. And and it was when he had started over when he had

230
00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:23.120
spent 40 years building his life. And and and and leaving the past behind. That God came back to him

231
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:32.460
and forced him to return. The thing about Moses is that he was someone who left a murderer. But now

232
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:40.920
God is asking him to return and be a deliverer. Now, those are two very different things. A murderer

233
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:48.490
and a deliverer in the same person. And then it tells us that God is able to redeem all of us, that

234
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:55.780
he's able to redeem anything in our past, that there is nothing that he is not able to turn around.

235
00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:07.370
And so Moses who was a murderer is now a deliverer and only God would do such a thing. Only God

236
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:15.990
would choose someone who made mistakes, even though his own people, His own mother, sister and

237
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:22.700
brother were inspired to believe that if Moses could be saved when all the other Children died, then

238
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:29.110
surely he would be used by God. But then that promise died

239
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:41.520
then it didn't happen when people looked at Moses, all they could think of was how he had ruined his

240
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:49.020
opportunity had God had put him in the palace, but he deserves to be in a prison.

241
00:37:51.100 --> 00:38:01.250
And because he wasn't going to go to prison, he decided to escape and start his life over somewhere

242
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:12.130
else. And then God forced him to return. You see, Moses left his past behind him, but God forced

243
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.190
Moses to face it. Nonetheless,

244
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:23.940
I once had a friend in high school who was incredibly close to me, my best friend and we did

245
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:30.300
everything together and the time came when I became a person of faith and we went off to see Jeff

246
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:35.250
and and that's what God reached me just as I was heading into university and began to work in my

247
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:40.350
life and changed things and changed the person who I was and changed my my direction and my purpose

248
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:45.640
and my intent for life and this best friend of mine just struggled with that because we had done

249
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:50.800
everything together. Our lives together were very different than they were now. And I kept speaking

250
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.580
of this faith and talking about the changes and how I couldn't do those things anymore and I didn't

251
00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:01.380
want to do them. I didn't feel like that was my direction in my life. And it got to the point where

252
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:07.690
the pressure, we got to be so much that I just began to pray that God would just release me from

253
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.880
this person. I didn't have the strength to always resist him. And so I found myself being pulled

254
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:20.050
back into the old things and into the old life and into the old temptations that was to, I used to

255
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:26.100
not even look at temptations. I used to just look at them as just my life, but now I saw them as

256
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:31.330
temptations. I saw them for what they were. I saw them for the evil that it was and and for how it

257
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:40.350
made me feel and for how it was altering my mind and how it was just breaking my my soul. And and

258
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.210
and and the more I tried to resist him, the harder it would become, the more the fights would

259
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:49.440
intensify. And and uh I just found myself withdrawing from him and there was a lot of pressure and

260
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:54.560
and he had so many problems in his, in his own household, like, like he really needed me and

261
00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:00.680
depended on me because things were not good at home. And I felt this obligation to to be the strong

262
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.050
friend that God wanted me to be for him and to be that friend that I had always been. But I just

263
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:12.690
couldn't do it anymore. Got to the point where he came to me and spoke to me and said you know my my

264
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:20.460
parents have made a decision that they're moving out of province and and I looked at that and I said

265
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:26.210
God wow you you you saved me, you delivered me from something that I wasn't able to handle at that

266
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:33.250
time. You took a friend who was really my best friend and his influence over my life and you did

267
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:39.700
this so that I could get stronger. Something happened that years later as now a pastor and many

268
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:46.970
years had gone by and I found myself taking a flight and I was actually heading to the city in which

269
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:55.760
he was in and and on that flight um someone walks by me and I said wow that looks a lot like

270
00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:03.810
somebody that I know and then sure enough I turned around in my seat and just a few seats back on

271
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.150
the opposite aisle it was my old best friend.

272
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:19.450
I thought to myself, wow, that's crazy. Like now God wants me to see him speak to him like just who

273
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:27.580
knows how things will be different now because we had spoken to each other in years. But You know it

274
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:33.150
was like a 6-hour flight and and and the more time passes, the more I built it up in my mind and the

275
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:37.660
more I built it up in my heart and it became bigger and stronger and then more importantly I

276
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:45.600
remembered all the pain and the trauma and and I remember the sin and the sinfulness and I

277
00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:52.380
remembered all the bad times more than I remember any of the good that does that ever happen to

278
00:41:52.380 --> 00:42:01.560
anybody else. And then as I was sitting there, I felt like I can't go back to this. And so even

279
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:07.820
though we had the entire flight, I never once spoke a word to him and then I waited for him to get

280
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:14.300
off the plane and he did and then I said, okay, it's safe, I can go. And I finally got out of my

281
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:22.530
seat, the last person on the plane, I got out of my seat and made it out and then got into the

282
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:31.900
airport and and there he was just waiting for me, I'm like why would this guy go like just leave me

283
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:40.680
alone? And in that moment I had this ability to just like keep walking towards him and finally say

284
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:47.530
the words hi, it's been awhile or something to that extent. You know what he did instead?

285
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.840
I just kept walking.

286
00:42:54.010 --> 00:43:00.470
I just walked out of the airport and I never looked back

287
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.050
if you want to leave now you can

288
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:16.430
because it's a horrible thing to do. And sometimes it's good to talk about the, the moments when we

289
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:22.120
were not really who we were supposed to be, does that, does that make sense?

290
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:31.820
And the thing about this story is that I had an opportunity because God wouldn't let me escape my

291
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:39.590
past and he was forcing me to face it, but I wasn't ready to has anybody else, like just walked away

292
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:44.730
from a similar opportunity because God kept bringing you back. But you just weren't ready to deal

293
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:52.850
with it. Here's here's what I know, here's what I know, because I've seen it after this is that this

294
00:43:52.860 --> 00:44:02.340
opportunity keeps coming back until I deal with it. Yeah. God's not gonna let me not deal with it

295
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:11.820
until it's dealt with. I'm gonna be forced to face it. Now, the thing about Moses is that he needed

296
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:17.490
the promise fulfilled in his life. So he was trying to fulfill it his own way. Now, here's what

297
00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:21.440
happens in this story and and sometimes we don't want to hear these things, but I'm gonna tell you

298
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.980
them anyways, because they're in the scripture and they're important for us to x experience the

299
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.470
fulfillment of his promise. And one of the worst things that I could discover about the life of

300
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:38.160
Moses was the trajectory that he had to go through in terms of what was needed to be done to be able

301
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:46.260
to experience the fulfillment of the promise. And the first thing is the promise fulfilled requires

302
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.440
respect to those in authority.

303
00:44:51.090 --> 00:45:01.730
Now, the whole thing about leaving things in the past is about becoming our own person, starting

304
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:09.690
over and no longer allowing the people in our past who had authority to continue to have authority

305
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:16.570
over us. I think one of the reasons why we don't go back and one of the reasons why I kept avoiding

306
00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:24.660
this person in my story was because they had authority over me. In a way that I didn't like in a way

307
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:33.830
that I didn't feel strong enough to resist and to overcome. And so what we read in the story is this

308
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:43.750
is that Moses speaks to his father in law, even though God reveals himself in a burning bush And and

309
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:51.170
he goes to his father in law and look at this in Exodus chapter four verse 18. And he says, so,

310
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:56.470
Moses went back home to Jethro, His father in law and then he says to him, these words, please let

311
00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:04.820
me return to my relatives. In Egypt, I don't even know if they're still alive. And then Jethro

312
00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:12.330
replies, go in peace. And so then it says that Moses went back home to Jethro, his father in law.

313
00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:20.350
Now he just had God revealed himself in a burning bush. The last people you ever want to speak to

314
00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:26.130
after you've had an encounter with God or your in laws, Am I right or am I wrong? The last people

315
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:33.410
you want to go and ask permission to is an in law. That's what you would imagine would be the case

316
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:40.420
for everyone. And I think at this point, you know, Moses has his own authority over his own

317
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:53.410
household, but he goes to his father in law and says, please let me return. He says the words please

318
00:46:53.420 --> 00:47:02.350
let me return. So he does this with his father not. Let's take a look at Moses then needs to do this

319
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:10.140
with his brother. His brother is three years older than him. At this point In that burning Bush

320
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:18.960
experience where God speaks to Moses, Moses is 80 years old. Aaron is 83 years old. And so Aaron is

321
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:24.950
his older brother and therefore in his household, he is the authority.

322
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:34.630
And so what God does is that he speaks to Aaron who is the eldest and tells him to go and to meet

323
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:42.990
Moses at the mountain and this is what happens. So now the Lord had said to Aaron, go into the

324
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:50.920
wilderness to meet Moses. And so Aaron went and met Moses at the mountain of God and he embraced him

325
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:57.900
and then Moses then told Aaron everything that the Lord had commanded him to say. And he told him

326
00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:04.800
about the miraculous signs the Lord had commanded him to perform. And so now he's gone to his father

327
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:14.550
in law and he now has gone to his brother and then here's what Moses does next. Now he goes into

328
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:21.510
Egypt instead of going directly to pharaoh's throne, which you would imagine is what he was supposed

329
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:33.870
to do Moses finds other authorities. Now Moses speaks to Israel's leaders and it says in exodus.

330
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:41.880
Chapter four verse 29 to 31. That Moses and Aaron returned to Egypt and they called all the elders

331
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:48.270
of Israel together. And then Aaron told them everything that the Lord had told Moses. Now why is

332
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:58.180
Aaron speaking? Because Moses still has no credibility among his own people. Because in that moment

333
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:08.000
Moses is still a murderer. In that moment Moses comes back as a murderer. He comes back more

334
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.110
Egyptian than Hebrew. He comes back not as a deliverer. So he needs Aaron who was among those people

335
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:27.680
and Aaron who had the authority to speak into that room. He has Aaron do the talking. And Aaron is

336
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:39.640
the one who now tells them why they should listen to Moses and now Moses comes forward and the

337
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:48.510
scripture say that in that moment to prove that everything had happened as Aaron had said it, it

338
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:57.790
says that he performed the miraculous signs as they watched. And then the people of Israel were

339
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:06.110
convinced that the Lord had sent Moses and Aaron and when they heard that the Lord had concerned was

340
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:12.860
concerned about them and had seen their misery. Then they bowed down and they worshiped and when

341
00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:24.720
they had all been spoken to look at this, then Moses delivers the message to pharaoh amazing, right.

342
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:35.790
And you see how he submitted himself to receive promise, he revisits his past to become the

343
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:46.410
deliverer, he can't be the person he is until he deals with that and once he's dealt with it, what

344
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:52.950
happens is that the power of God is, is unleashed in Moses life and he's able to perform miraculous

345
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:59.800
signs for them and God allows this so that the people will be convinced because they needed to see

346
00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:07.220
those signs in the same way that Jesus came among his people and performed signs miraculous signs so

347
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:15.820
that people would believe that God was indeed sending them a deliverer. And so in the same way that

348
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:23.430
Jesus was able to perform miraculous science Moses is doing that in this story. And so the problem

349
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:36.840
with this story is that it isn't a story that has any hope unless Moses takes these steps. I want

350
00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:42.310
God to bless your life. I really want him to do incredible things. But if we don't deal with the

351
00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:47.250
things in our past, if we don't learn from them and grow from them, if we don't confront them and

352
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:54.110
face them and I'm not saying that we are going to be able to redeem restore and somehow reconcile

353
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.010
with everything in our past,

354
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:03.390
it's not always gonna turn out the way we want. It's not always going to be possible to bring back

355
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:12.300
that which was taken lost possibly squandered along the way, but it is going to be possible for you

356
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:21.280
to heal to be able to be the one who carries the promise of God into the future that God has already

357
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:29.080
prepared for you. But you cannot go forward until you're willing first to go back

358
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:40.260
and he goes through these steps and he does this because he now realizes that he needs to confront

359
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:48.900
Farrell. He needs to confront him. And this is a powerful moment in which we see that this

360
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:59.770
presentation to pharaoh is what happens next. And so what Moses does is that he goes to Pharaoh now

361
00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:05.940
he can because he's taken care of the things in his past and I love what he says to him in Exodus

362
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:13.010
five. And in verse one, it says that after this presentation to Israel's leaders, Moses and Aaron

363
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:18.560
went and they spoke to pharaoh and then they told him these words, this is what the Lord the God of

364
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:25.860
Israel says. And now we all remember this part which is I think many of us have heard this before

365
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:35.130
where it says, let my people go. But the part that follows is this so that they may hold a festival,

366
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:42.950
which is a feast, which is basically a celebration and that they would do it in my honor and look at

367
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:48.770
this and that they would do it in the wilderness,

368
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:59.890
that they would do this in the wilderness. And this is what we're going to look at in just a few

369
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:11.090
moments. But it's important that we know what it is. That Moses actually says the pharaoh. Now when

370
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:19.010
Moses tried to bring about the result that he wanted, which was the freedom of his people Moses

371
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:26.060
tried to do it by his own hand. But the second principle is this, that the promise can only be

372
00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:34.960
fulfilled by God's head, not our own. And so if we look at the promise of God, it can only be

373
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:42.440
fulfilled when it's God himself who fulfills it. If it's done by our hand, then it's by our power.

374
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:50.420
It's by our and it's for our glory, but it needs to be by God's power. So it is for God's glory. So

375
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:57.750
no one can take credit and we can look to God and say this was beyond my ability, beyond my capacity,

376
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:05.450
beyond my resources, beyond my intelligence, beyond anything that I had at my availability and

377
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:12.130
beyond anything anyone could have given me or come alongside me and helped me to accomplish none of

378
00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:18.440
these things are enough to fulfill the promise of God. The only one who can fulfill the promise of

379
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:26.290
God is God. Now, sometimes I feel like I'm the one who's either standing in the way of God

380
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:33.560
fulfilling his promise or trying to help God to fulfill his promise. But what I've come to

381
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:42.740
understand is that when God makes a promise, there is power in resting, being still and knowing that

382
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:50.890
God will fulfill the promise. That what he's looking from me is for me to be true to him, to be

383
00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:58.110
faithful to him, to believe in the promise regardless of the circumstances of my life, regardless of

384
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:09.630
what is happening, regardless of what is going on. And so Moses the Bible tells us that the Lord

385
00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:20.840
tells Moses this now you will see what I will do to pharaoh remember it's God saying this when he

386
00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:28.400
feels and then he says the force of my strong hand and then he will let the people go. In fact, he

387
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:39.360
will force them to leave his land. Now we know that Moses committed murder by his own hand and he

388
00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:50.260
tried to deliver an Israelite from the abuse that he was experiencing by his slave guards that were

389
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:58.760
Egyptian. And the Bible says that he found this person who had been abusing the Israelite slaves and

390
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:06.990
he murdered him and he buried his body in the desert and and he did this because he saw himself as a

391
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:14.260
deliverer and he believed that God was going to use him. The problem is that he tried to do it by

392
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:22.110
his own hand. Now, God says, I need you to understand this principle. If you want to see my promise

393
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:30.460
is fulfilled in your life, it's not going to be by your hand. It's going to be by my strong hand. Is

394
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:37.410
that clear? That makes sense. It's going to be God who brings that about. So that's the second

395
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:45.350
principle. The first one is that we are forced to face our past and respect those in authority over

396
00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:52.900
our lives. Because the ultimate authority in our lives is God. And when we respect lesser

397
00:57:52.900 --> 00:58:01.600
authorities, we are giving greater authority to the greatest authority there is which is God. When

398
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:08.430
you understand authority, you understand that those people are also under God. But if you don't

399
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:14.530
respect the authorities and pray for the authorities and face the authorities and deal with the

400
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:21.510
authorities, then how are you going to be in a relationship with the greatest authority of all? How

401
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:28.050
are you going to walk with God? If you don't understand that he is the authority that has the

402
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:35.580
ultimate say in your life. If you then are unable to respect the lesser authorities in your life,

403
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:45.740
how are you going to experience the fulfillment of God's promise? If you believe that your hand is

404
00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:53.190
stronger than the hand of God, that every time something great happens in your life, you praise

405
00:58:53.190 --> 00:59:02.560
yourself instead of praising the Lord that you give others thanks more than you give Jesus thanks

406
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:10.690
for having brought them into your life. How are you going to see the fulfillment of God's promises

407
00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:21.100
for greater things? If you are unable to see the hand of God in everything everywhere, doing

408
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:29.190
whatever is required to fulfill his promises for your life. I want to believe in the strength and in

409
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:37.770
the power of God's hand, not in my own, not in the hand of someone who I even respect having

410
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:44.230
authority, I don't want to look to that person and to say their hand is going to make this happen. I

411
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:52.230
only believe in one hand and that is in the hand of God, his strong hand and and and Moses receives

412
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:57.790
this word from God himself and he says I'm going to make this happen Moses, but it's not gonna be by

413
00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:04.740
your hand like you try to do in the past, it's gonna be by my hand. And that's how you're going to

414
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.780
experience the fulfillment of my promises in your future.

415
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.680
The third thing.

416
01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.410
And by the way, there's only three things. So don't worry

417
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.490
is that the promise fulfilled

418
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.560
will look like worship in the wilderness.

419
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:42.270
And when I when I read this, it kind of like just took me back to understanding how I can look at my

420
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:48.230
life and look at what's happening in my life and find myself in the wilderness and and being in the

421
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:54.520
wilderness means that I don't feel like worshiping God. It means that I don't feel like trusting him

422
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:59.400
believing in him. It means that I have lost sight of the promise. And most likely I just don't

423
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:06.940
believe that it can come to my life. But there's something beautiful about what he says in these

424
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:14.990
verses and I want to read them to you and it says this in the story in which we're in that you are

425
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:27.020
going to announce to him this, the Lord the God of the hebrews has sent me to tell you, let my

426
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:38.980
people go so they can worship me in the wilderness. And until now you have refused to listen to him.

427
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:47.340
Imagine that Moses has to keep going back to pharaoh, right? And he keeps reminding him that this is

428
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:55.290
what the promise is going to look like. It means that they're gonna not be in the promised land, but

429
01:01:55.290 --> 01:02:06.340
they're gonna have to worship him in the wilderness. They'll be out of Egypt. But in between Egypt

430
01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:16.890
and the promised land, there was a requirement to worship God in the wilderness. I just want to get

431
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:24.020
out of Egypt and just like the Israelites just walked the three days it would take to step into

432
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:31.260
Canaan, which would have been the promised land. I don't want this in between part that that God is

433
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:37.690
already telling his people and and it's like God knew that they would rebel. He knew that they would

434
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:42.860
look back. He knew that they'd want to go back. He knew that they would love to go back rather than

435
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:48.510
keep going forward. He knew that they would rather stay slaves than live free. He knew that even

436
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:56.140
though he had given them a deliverer, that they wouldn't want that deliverance, he knew all of that.

437
01:02:56.150 --> 01:03:05.620
And yet in spite of this, God still tells them, I want you to release my people to pharaoh and this

438
01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:12.610
is a message to all the Israelites because for you to experience the promise, you're going to have

439
01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:18.410
to first worship me in the wilderness now, many times, I don't get to experience the promises of God

440
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:25.860
in my life previously, because I didn't understand the purpose of the wilderness, and I didn't

441
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:33.290
understand what I needed to do when I was in that wilderness, I needed to understand that I needed

442
01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:40.690
to worship in the wilderness, anybody else, anybody else still struggling with that. I I think

443
01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:46.070
that's the hardest time in which to do it. Now, when you get out of Egypt, I think you're you're

444
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:50.960
kind of looking on your past and you're saying this wilderness is better than the slavery I was in.

445
01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:55.800
But you're still in the wilderness, right? And it gets to the point where you resent the wilderness

446
01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.610
that you're in, and if you're in it for as long as the Israelites were in it, then you stop

447
01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:05.580
believing in the promise altogether. Because you start to realize that the only thing God seems to

448
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:12.720
want from me is worshiping the wilderness, and I hate God for that. And what happened is that the

449
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:21.490
people hated worshiping God in the wilderness. And it got to the point where they would rather make

450
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:29.850
their own idol and worship that than continue to worship a God who wouldn't let them leave the

451
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:36.880
wilderness, is this starting to make sense? You see what's happening in the story, it's happening in

452
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:43.490
our own lives. You see it gets to the point where we stop worshiping God in the wilderness and then

453
01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:53.020
we fashion idols. We make gods of our own hands and we leave God and we kneel at idols and we say,

454
01:04:53.030 --> 01:05:02.360
this is God, this is gonna be my God in this wilderness. Forget this God, this God who promised to

455
01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:09.470
be my deliverer, Forget this God who talks about having a strong hand, forget this God who promised

456
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:16.570
me I'll land with milk and honey. And instead all I'm living is the wilderness. Instead, I'm tired

457
01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:25.430
of this God. And so I will go and I will make a god of my own likeness and I will worship there

458
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:29.910
instead. Oh man, I've done that.

459
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:37.120
I've done that when I've been tired, I've done that when I've been weak, I've been that when I've

460
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.030
been frustrated when I've been angry was filled with frustration and resentment towards God. When I

461
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:50.760
when I didn't want to worship God in the wilderness that I was in. But here's what the scriptures

462
01:05:50.760 --> 01:06:01.950
promise us. That if we worship God in the wilderness, then we are prepared for what comes next in

463
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:11.050
the promised land. And the promise that God has for you is going to be forged in your life and

464
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:19.120
through the experiences of worshiping God in the wilderness. You will not be the person that God

465
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:27.880
needs you to be unless you go through that process of having to worship him in the wilderness. And

466
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.810
so the next time you look at your wilderness and you don't feel like worshiping him and you feel

467
01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:42.560
like making an idol and following that instead stand up like Joshua did and say these words.

468
01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:51.870
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord, can you do that?

469
01:06:54.180 --> 01:07:05.410
As for me and my house we will serve the Lord and when God takes me out of the wilderness, I will

470
01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:14.360
know that I can leave this behind because he will have given me something new and will have

471
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:24.450
fulfilled his promise to me. God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Would you stand as we would just

472
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:32.650
wrap this up in prayer and we have a great and awesome community meal that we are going to be able

473
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:38.510
to partake in and I wanna encourage you guys to stay around for that and I know that clothes have

474
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:47.100
also been set up in the lobby and you can take whatever you need and you feel free to also drop off

475
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:55.880
winter clothes in the next little while. Um save the summer clothes until we at least reach spring.

476
01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.910
Do not do not bring your spring clothes. Now we have nowhere to store them, we need to give them

477
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:10.210
away. So bring your winter clothes so we can give those away. Makes sense. Okay And uh and then just

478
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:15.470
hold on to them and if you really can't then then you know speak to someone on the community kitchen

479
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:21.920
team and they will be able to help us out with that. Um I want to encourage you to do one of two

480
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:31.130
things. One, I want you to stay for this meal too. If you haven't made a donation yet to our

481
01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:37.640
community hall fundraiser, I would love it if today is the last Sunday that we have to mention

482
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:45.480
talking about the money that we need for the basement, anybody else agree if all of us do something

483
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:54.500
today, there's just a little bit left, we can do it. If we've already raised what we have, then

484
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:58.800
today should be more than enough and doesn't have to just come from this group. It's people who

485
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.860
watch online. I know we get a lot of the transfers and people who are using the apps and sending

486
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.750
money to us. That's amazing. Thank you for that. That's how we got here. But if you can all not

487
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:19.840
depend on someone else reaching the goal, but you participate in it with whatever amount you can,

488
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:27.550
here's what's gonna happen, God is going to fulfill our promise to this community to reopen that

489
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:36.450
space and be more effective as a community of faith. Can you help us to fulfill that promise? God

490
01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:42.050
bless you guys. Thank you father for every person for everyone that's here for the meal. That's been

491
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:47.290
prepared. Thank you for those hands that prepared it. Thank you Lord for those lives that sacrificed

492
01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:53.160
for him. Thank you for the contributions, the giving, thank you for the volunteers, everyone that is

493
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:59.360
making this church such a special gift to this community. We pray for all communities of faith in

494
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.630
our city. We pray for them in our province. We pray for them around the world and we ask Lord that

495
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:13.020
you would fulfill your promises in all of your people's lives. You see who is here today, You see

496
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:19.860
what they need and you see what they require of you and how difficult it may be for them to respect

497
01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:26.590
the authorities to believe in a hand that is stronger than their own to possibly even just looking

498
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:32.930
at their past, not trust the season in which they're in the wilderness that they're still

499
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:39.390
experiencing and not believing in the promise that you have offered them today. I pray God that you

500
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:46.650
would change our minds and our hearts transform us from the inside out and lead us to the

501
01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:54.270
fulfillment of your promise for each of our lives and we pray this in the blessed name of Jesus, our

502
01:10:54.270 --> 01:11:03.040
Lord and savior. Amen, Amen. God bless you guys thank you so much. Let's sing this song together and

503
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.820
then johan is gonna come out to dismiss us and we're gonna have the meal together. God bless you

504
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.360
guys.

505
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:20.420
We're gonna sing the song. Freedom! Everyone's gonna get up on your feet, clap your hands. Let's get going.

524
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.830
Praise God, thank you so much.

525
01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:05.800
Wonderful, so happy again to have been with you this morning. Um first I want to apologize because

526
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:10.360

527
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:18.550
chicken. It was the check-in. So if their kids looking for a chicken uh sorry about that parents same

528
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:25.080
thing. So if you left your kids at the check-in or at the chicken please go grab them at the place

529
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:31.390
