00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:56.450
Hey, everyone. Are you open to Gods size dreams today?

2
00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.570
I think

3
00:08:02.109 --> 00:08:07.390
that's what our faith is about. It's about being able to dream, the things that God is giving us.

4
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:12.839
And there are some things that may not work out in our lives, but God has the ability to turn things

5
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.260
around for us. And that's why we're in this series called Turning Point. We're learning about the

6
00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:23.309
turning points in the lives of others in the scriptures about avoiding pitfalls and mistakes that

7
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:32.320
they have made so that we can avoid those same ones and be able to just take the next steps towards

8
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:38.070
experiencing our own turning point. We wanna welcome you to River's edge uh to this community of

9
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.789
faith, love and hope and we're so glad that you could be a part of this today and we are going to

10
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.280
worship together. We're gonna sing some songs and hear a message today that is gonna encourage us

11
00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:53.099
about averting tragic outcomes. And as we would sing these songs, it gives us an opportunity to take

12
00:08:53.109 --> 00:08:59.510
the attention off of ourselves and put it on God and put it in a place where God can truly bring

13
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.630
about the turnaround. We want to remind you that every Sunday at 10 a.m. we have our youth ministry

14
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:13.900
that takes place before the gathering. And at 10 30 our kids program is off and running and our kids

15
00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:19.700
start off with worship and then they go on to having a great lesson time and crafts and so many

16
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.380
other activities. And we're excited that we have such great teachers with them today and they're

17
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:30.359
gonna learn about Jesus, but we have a wonderful gathering that is planned for you today. And as you

18
00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:34.969
would worship to get out of there, that we would be reminded of how great and how faithful God is,

19
00:09:34.979 --> 00:09:42.359
no matter what it is that we're going through, that God can truly change our outcomes as we would

20
00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:47.309
worship Him together. Would you stand with me as we would open in a word of prayer? And I wanna

21
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.619
thank you God for this incredible group of people right here for those that are joining in on, on

22
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.510
our online platforms. And we want to welcome them because they're a part of this community of faith

23
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.349
as well. We wanna thank you for the way that you are joining us, not just here in this city, but

24
00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:08.150
around the world and for the way that you are bringing us together, to worship you, to learn from

25
00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:13.599
you to grow with you and also to be changed and transformed by you. And so today, Lord, as we would

26
00:10:13.609 --> 00:10:19.859
sing these songs and we would be reminders today of your faithfulness of your great power to be able

27
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:25.880
to turn things around for each of us. We give you our lives right now. And we ask, Lord, here are

28
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.960
the situations that we're going through. Here are the things that we're dealing with. Lord. Give us

29
00:10:30.969 --> 00:10:37.119
the breakthrough that we desire today and we pray these things in Jesus name. Amen. Let's welcome

30
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.570
the River's Edge worship team. And let's sing together.

31
00:10:50.809 --> 00:10:56.210
So glad you're in the house of the Lord, we're gonna sing this song about being here all together in the house.

42
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.210
So glad you're here in the house of the Lord. Let's keep worshiping

43
00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:55.190
Jesus. We love you, we love you, we love you, we love you, we love you. Thank you that you're here.

44
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.099
You know every single person here. You know every heart

45
00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:10.190
when we're going through things that are dark. I was thinking about this and this next song we're

46
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:16.640
gonna sing is a song that you can sing through your night season. The Bible says that he gives us

47
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:23.609
songs to sing in the night and sometimes all we can do is singing through the night. That's it.

48
00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:29.429
That's all we can do. And it can be so hard to do that when we don't know if he's moving, we don't

49
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.539
know, we can't see it, we can't feel it. And so I just wanna encourage you. I wanna hear every voice,

50
00:14:35.549 --> 00:14:41.099
every voice in this room. I want you to no matter where you're at, no matter what your walk is, no

51
00:14:41.109 --> 00:14:46.030
matter what your season looks like. I wanna hear every voice sing through their night season. I want

52
00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:52.789
you to sing through your night season. Sometimes we end up in the pit and sometimes we just have to

53
00:14:52.799 --> 00:15:00.520
learn to rearrange furniture in the pit. Literally, like I was asking God and I said, God, what do I

54
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:06.039
do when it feels like I'm thrown in a pit and I can't get out. And that's the season and he's like

55
00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:13.820
rearrange the furniture and fix your eyes on me. And sometimes we just have to do that and just lift

56
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:20.369
up our voice and remind our soul what's true. So I wanna hear every, every voice in this room,

57
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.880
wherever you're at, whatever you're doing. I want you to sing through, sing with your heart, through

58
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.330
your night season. God knows what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like for you, but

59
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.229
whatever night season you're walking through, sing this out as if it's your anthem. It's your

60
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:44.150
lifeline. We're gonna tell our soul that he's still moving and he's still fighting for you. Yeah.

89
00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:36.640
Praise God.

90
00:24:44.939 --> 00:24:45.770
You may be seated.

91
00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:11.280
I grew up in a Christian home and I struggled with my faith for a really long time. You know, I was

92
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:18.859
doing everything I could to follow God as best as possible. And at some point in my life, I heard a

93
00:25:18.869 --> 00:25:29.060
sermon and uh the one of the key point like scripture readings that he had was uh in John 3 30 which

94
00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:36.859
says he must become greater and I must become less. And that really helped me in my walk with Christ

95
00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:42.959
in that point because I was struggling and all of that like in my, in my walk and not understanding

96
00:25:42.969 --> 00:25:49.420
why I, I wasn't getting better. I was always getting pulled back to where I used to be. And then

97
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:57.589
once I heard that scripture, it instantly stuck to me and made me realize that's what's missing. And

98
00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:04.089
that's what I need to have that turning point in my walking in faith. And it was just to remember

99
00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:10.410
that God is God must be first in my life and I must make myself less.

100
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:23.050
So we all have turning points moments where we've had encounters with, with God. I believe that's

101
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:28.910
the reason why we're here. I believe that God has revealed himself somehow to us and it was a

102
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.390
turning point for us. And we just heard Nate share his turning point story. And today we're gonna be

103
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:40.349
looking at another turning point story in the scriptures. It's a dysfunctional family that of King

104
00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:47.500
David. And there's a lot of issues there. I don't know if you guys can relate, sometimes we can have

105
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:55.079
dysfunction that is at one level. And then there's like next level dysfunctions that when we tell

106
00:26:55.089 --> 00:27:01.819
other people about what our life was like and our upbringing and what our families were like, it

107
00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:09.949
kind of leaves them shocked that we somehow made it through that. Someone in the Bible by the name

108
00:27:09.959 --> 00:27:17.030
of David had such a great story, but he was such a, he had a really hard time being a good husband

109
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.000
and a good dad. He had a lot of victories in his life. But let's just say managing his household

110
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:29.260
wasn't one of them. In fact, God saw a lot of good in David and called him someone who was after his

111
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:37.560
own heart. But yet saw also all of his misgivings and saw all of his shortcomings and didn't hold

112
00:27:37.569 --> 00:27:43.849
back when it came to telling his story. In fact, when we look at the story of David and his life, we

113
00:27:43.859 --> 00:27:49.089
can see there are so many parts that can really speak to the dysfunction that he lived and can

114
00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:54.119
somehow can also relate to maybe some of the things that we've gone through or things that we've

115
00:27:54.130 --> 00:28:00.810
lived and the things that maybe we're struggling with today. And we think of how we can sometimes

116
00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:08.760
just connect with people and sometimes we connect because we feel like there's enough similarity in

117
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:14.479
our upbringing and maybe in our stories and maybe even in our traumas that can kind of bind us,

118
00:28:15.699 --> 00:28:21.229
bring us closer together. And sometimes when we see someone who hasn't gone through the things that

119
00:28:21.239 --> 00:28:28.410
we've gone through, we can sometimes just feel like there isn't a connection there. But if someone

120
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:35.619
has gone through a similar tragedy, has experienced a similar trauma, we can sometimes say this

121
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:44.699
person gets me and we can sometimes like, just not only take them into our lives um through

122
00:28:44.709 --> 00:28:50.510
friendship, but we can sometimes even just feel like they're a bit better fit for us relationship

123
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:59.239
wise. And it, it always surprises me that we sometimes would rather bond over trauma than we would

124
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.599
bond over health.

125
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:08.579
And, and we've got to look out for that because we may all have this tendency deeply rooted within

126
00:29:08.589 --> 00:29:15.180
us that without even realizing we're, we're choosing people to do life with that are just as broken

127
00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:21.000
as we are in certain ways in certain places and, and instead of things getting better for us, they,

128
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.890
they, well, they're, they're, they're just let me just put it, they're just not getting better. Yes.

129
00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:37.569
Instead of things being different, it's more of the same and we sometimes just don't realize that

130
00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:44.500
maybe this is a big reason for that. Well, I want to talk to you about how we can avert these tragic

131
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:51.579
outcomes. And one of David's sons, his name is Abelam. The Bible describes him as, as an

132
00:29:51.589 --> 00:30:01.270
extraordinary individual, incredibly talented, um extremely handsome good looking. He was someone

133
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:09.800
who was like, loved by his people. And yet he was in exile, in exile from his father. He was

134
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:15.410
estranged from him because he had done something that had displeased his father David. And,

135
00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:24.770
and even though he had sought justice and went about it his own way, his father couldn't agree with

136
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:31.400
it. And so therefore he cast him out of the kingdom for two years and for two years, he was not able

137
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:41.119
to come back and he didn't have any conversations at all on any level with his father and the

138
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:50.300
scriptures. Tell us that this estranged relationship began to really wreck havoc in Absalon's life. To

139
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:57.020
the point where the people who were against David started to side with Absalom and Absalom created

140
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:03.650
the environment for this to also happen. He did everything that he could to be the one who would be

141
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.959
loved and, and his father, David be would be the one who would be hated. And, and a lot of that had

142
00:31:08.969 --> 00:31:15.359
to do with the way that he had not encountered justice towards his sister tomorrow. And, and the

143
00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:23.500
other was also because he had been rejected by his father so wholeheartedly. And sometimes we, we

144
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:31.839
find ourselves at a turning point because our life stops becoming about living a life of purpose and

145
00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:39.599
more about just finding ways to fulfill the purpose of revenge.

146
00:31:42.589 --> 00:31:47.439
And interestingly enough, that's what happens in Absalom's life without realizing it. Every decision

147
00:31:47.449 --> 00:31:56.010
now is about making sure that he proves his father wrong and that he was right all along. Have you

148
00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:02.530
ever been motivated to prove someone wrong? Like, I mean, really, really motivated where your life

149
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:10.060
decisions were all about making sure that that person wasn't right. I, I almost became an architect

150
00:32:10.069 --> 00:32:12.920
because my teacher in grade six said I couldn't become one

151
00:32:16.729 --> 00:32:20.949
is, is that that kind of thing. I remember going in high school and people would ask me, what do you

152
00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:24.660
want to become? And I'm like, and I thought about my teacher in grade six who said I could never

153
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:30.199
become an architect. And I thought that's exactly what I wanna be because because they had motivated

154
00:32:30.209 --> 00:32:35.359
me in the wrong way. Have you ever, have you ever been challenged like that in your life? You just

155
00:32:35.369 --> 00:32:43.489
wanted to prove someone wrong and, and sometimes it just guides and directs your life choices. Uh I

156
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.520
hate the fact that she was right. I'm not an architect today and just in case you were wondering,

157
00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:58.160
and I'm glad that I came to my senses and figured out my own path instead of letting my path be

158
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:08.839
determined by proving someone else wrong. But every decision that Absalom is making is all about him,

159
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:20.339
making sure that he's right. And the first thing that we have to avert, if we want to avert a tragic

160
00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:24.209
outcome is we can't believe our own hype

161
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.800
and there's something about that that can speak to all of us in one way or another. I know what

162
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.819
you're thinking. Like, you may think about yourself and you may think of yourself as someone who's

163
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:40.510
humble, you know, someone who's temperate in their understanding of who they are and what they bring

164
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.979
to the table. And you kind of like, don't think too highly of yourself. You, you've gone through

165
00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:50.280
enough in life where you kind of have figured out where you, where you stand in relation to things.

166
00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:59.270
But, but what I've come to understand is, is, is the opposite to be true. I, I believe every day we

167
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.829
struggle with pride in ways that continue to surprise us

168
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:10.239
and that there's always a moment in which we think we're, we're smarter, we're better, we're, we're

169
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:15.830
maybe be better skilled at something than someone else and maybe we've got a better answer and we've,

170
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:24.399
we would have taken a better direction and made a better choice that we look down on people who

171
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:32.179
are doing certain things and say things like I would never do that myself and, and believe it or not

172
00:34:32.189 --> 00:34:39.089
in those moments, we are believing our own hype. See, there's ways of us believing our own hype in a

173
00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:45.178
way that that maybe isn't always that clear and that apparent even to our own eyes and to our own

174
00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:52.208
heart and to our own understanding and, and that's exactly what happened to absalon because he kept

175
00:34:52.218 --> 00:34:57.329
hearing from the moment he was born, how beautiful he was. And, and he just believed that more than

176
00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:05.509
anything else. And the scriptures tell us that in second Samuel chapter 14 and in verse 25 and 26 it

177
00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:13.509
says that Absalom was praised as the most handsome man in all of Israel. Isn't there a cover on

178
00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:19.590
People magazine for someone like that? I think so. I think it's called the sexiest man alive. If, if,

179
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:26.590
if, if there was such a thing as the sexiest man alive in Israel at that time, absalon would have

180
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:36.080
been on the cover. That's, that's how beautiful he was. And the, and verse 26 says something

181
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:43.340
ridiculous. It says that he only cut his hair only once a year and then only because it was so heavy

182
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:50.419
when he weighed it out, it came to £5 who weighs their hair

183
00:35:53.530 --> 00:36:02.770
after they got it. Tell me this guy is not buying into his own hype, right? Like that's next level

184
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:11.750
vanity. Come on. You gotta agree. Next level vanity, he's winging his hair. Like who cares how much

185
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:20.629
it weighs? Like why is that important? Well, it was important to epsilon because he kept being

186
00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:28.260
praised for it. You ever get praised for something and then I don't know, it doesn't look as good as

187
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:34.760
you start to get older. Doesn't that like really hurt? Maybe at some point you were, you were

188
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:39.020
praised for your looks, maybe praised for your hair. And then all of a sudden you start to lose it

189
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:45.639
all. And you're like, no, the one thing I had going for me,

190
00:36:52.149 --> 00:36:56.510
I think we can understand that sometimes when you're the best at something you want to still be the

191
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:04.800
best. I it's like we, we wanna live up to our hype. You know, we wanna, we wanna still be that

192
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:11.060
person who was popular in high school. When we go back to our reunion. We want to see how badly

193
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:17.739
everyone has failed in comparison to ourselves. We're not interested in their successes. We just

194
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.290
want them to see that the hype was real

195
00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:28.709
and, and so we, we do these things and, and you can see that in the scriptures here was doing

196
00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:35.489
exactly that. And then in first Samuel 16 7, it says that but the Lord said to Samuel,

197
00:37:38.149 --> 00:37:41.060
I don't want you to judge by anyone's appearance or height

198
00:37:43.379 --> 00:37:48.030
because I have rejected the candidates that you would have chosen to be king

199
00:37:50.919 --> 00:37:57.219
because the Lord doesn't see things in the way that you see them, the people, they judge by outward

200
00:37:57.229 --> 00:37:59.949
appearance. But the Lord looks at the heart

201
00:38:02.169 --> 00:38:08.129
and what God is saying is that the thing that I care about most is what's happening on the inside.

202
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:17.889
It's who you are when no one's looking and even when others are praising you, are you able to take

203
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:21.469
that praise and turn it back to me and give me the glory. Instead,

204
00:38:23.739 --> 00:38:31.360
you see, when we take the glory for ourselves, then that's our reward. But when we take the glory

205
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:36.739
that we receive from, from our peers and from those who acknowledge us and maybe show us honor and

206
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:42.419
respect and, and, and who highlight something that we've done. That was extraordinary. And we, and

207
00:38:42.429 --> 00:38:49.560
we just receive that and we don't honor God with it and give it back to him and glorify him with it.

208
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:58.550
Then that is the only reward we receive. But when you bless God with the rewards you have and, and

209
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:05.540
receive and the accolades you take and, and, and, and you acknowledge that you did something pretty

210
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:11.889
cool, but you were only able to do it because, because God is the one who gifted you in the first

211
00:39:11.899 --> 00:39:18.209
place that He's the one who gave you this honor to be able to carry it out, that the honor isn't

212
00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:23.580
yours, but it's his and that you're just a steward and a manager of it. What God does is He looks at

213
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:29.969
your heart and he says this is a person that I want to keep rewarding. There's a person that I want

214
00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:35.739
to give more to, I want to entrust more to them. I don't want that to be taken away. I want to give

215
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.429
them more because when they receive it,

216
00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:41.810
they honor me with it.

217
00:39:44.189 --> 00:39:50.199
See, I, I wanna avert tragic outcomes by not believing my own height.

218
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.370
I want to give glory to God in all instances. And I want to make sure that my heart always aligns

219
00:39:57.379 --> 00:40:04.919
with His, that I'm thinking more about honoring Him than having myself honored. See, when we live

220
00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:09.120
like that, God says, you're a person. I want to bless you're a person. I want to reward, you're a

221
00:40:09.129 --> 00:40:13.739
person. I want to trust with more. I want to give you this and I want to give you that and I want to

222
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:19.929
give you so much more than even whatever it is that you can even think or imagine whatever it is

223
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:24.729
that you think you can ask me and you think it's too big. I want you to know that my heart and my

224
00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:32.320
desire is to give you even more than that. Why? Because whenever the opportunity comes for you to

225
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:36.760
receive that praise as your reward, you take it and you give it back to me instead because you

226
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:43.439
acknowledge that I'm the source of all good things that are beautiful in your life. And I want you

227
00:40:43.449 --> 00:40:51.330
to keep experiencing that. See, God wants to give you those beautiful things because you are

228
00:40:51.340 --> 00:41:01.679
beautiful to the Lord. There's no one that is more beautiful to him than you are. You see, you mean

229
00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:08.290
everything to God like you are the only person in the room at all times and you can do that with

230
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:20.540
each of us. He has the power and the ability to love all of us that powerfully that equally. And so

231
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:27.459
all we have to do is just not believe our hype. The second thing that Absalom did was that he

232
00:41:27.469 --> 00:41:37.239
believed that his freedom was always free from morality during the time in which Absalom was unable

233
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:44.989
to be near his father and was living in exile. The scriptures tell us in second Samuel chapter 14

234
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.219
verse 28 to 30 that absalon lived in Jerusalem for two years, but he never got to see the king. And

235
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:59.300
Absalom sent for Joe and Joe Hab was, was David's um closest friend and, and military advisor in

236
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:05.840
general. He was the guy that, that, that uh David really leaned on and trusted and believed in and

237
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:11.820
he knew that if he could get to Johab could, could get to his father. And so what he's trying to

238
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:20.300
do is get Jo's attention. But, but Johab refuses to listen to anything that epsilon has to say

239
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:29.399
because he's honoring David, he's honoring the king. And so absalon sends for Joab and he, he asks

240
00:42:29.409 --> 00:42:36.610
him to intercede for him. But Jo Hab just refuses to come and then absalon sent for him a second

241
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:46.840
time. But then Joe Hab refused to come. Now, one of the worst things in life is when someone reads

242
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.729
your text message and doesn't respond that

243
00:42:52.919 --> 00:43:03.120
I I've done it to people and I am sorry for that. It is one of the deadly sins. I know that that's

244
00:43:03.129 --> 00:43:07.830
the eighth, deadly sin that there's seven, but there's an eighth one and it's, and it's not

245
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.939
responding to text messages and, and it, and it's worse when, when the bubbles appear

246
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:26.370
and then they disappear and then you wonder why, what happened, you were going to answer and then

247
00:43:26.379 --> 00:43:33.129
you chose not to answer and then, you know, this person is editing themselves. Right? Like they're,

248
00:43:33.139 --> 00:43:38.050
they're either coming up with an excuse for a reason or they're trying to figure something out like

249
00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:42.280
that. They, they're about to send it and they delete it. You know, there's more to it than, than

250
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:47.729
just what meets the eye. I, I'm getting too riled up about this. I know. But

251
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:57.780
mhm But when you ask for an audience and that audience is refused, doesn't that hurt? Bother you

252
00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:02.330
when you have a plan and you have a purpose and you've got something figured out and you know that

253
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:07.830
if this, if this could just fall into place, it would just work out the way that you needed to, you

254
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:14.350
know, that it would work out great for you. All you need is for this contact to come through. This

255
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:21.639
person holds the keys to your success. I mean, them answering means that the doors open, it means

256
00:44:21.649 --> 00:44:26.870
that the opportunity lies behind that. It means that you finally get the success that you've been

257
00:44:26.879 --> 00:44:27.709
yearning for.

258
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:36.479
And sometimes we just think of life that way, we think that if I only knew a Joab and if only Joab

259
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:43.030
could come, if only he could hear me pitch my thing, then surely I would have success.

260
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:50.500
And you see, when we think like this, we're, we're already corrupted in our mind because what we

261
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.080
think is that we can manipulate outcomes

262
00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:02.879
and still be successful. You can manipulate outcomes and have success, but that doesn't make you

263
00:45:02.889 --> 00:45:03.489
successful.

264
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:13.449
And what happens in this story is that is that Jo Hab refuses to come because he's gonna be loyal to

265
00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:19.379
David, not to epsilon. He's not gonna fall into his trap and into his trappings. And so look at what

266
00:45:19.689 --> 00:45:26.600
David does. Look at the extent that he goes to. He says that epsilon said to his servants because he

267
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:36.070
hadn't come the second time. I want you to go and set fire to Joe Abs Barley Field. It is the field

268
00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:43.010
next to mine. And so they set his field on fire as Selon had commanded.

269
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:52.689
Alam believes that he's under a measure of protection. He's the king's son, he's in exile, he's

270
00:45:52.699 --> 00:45:56.060
estranged from the king, but he still has power. He's a king's son

271
00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:03.280
and he knows that if he burns his field, Jo Hub can't do a thing about it.

272
00:46:07.209 --> 00:46:17.100
I did you ever gas light someone like just set them on fire, you just let him into a trap and then

273
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:24.050
you did it knowing it all along that it was to accomplish your own outcome. That's exactly what

274
00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:33.610
absalon does in this situation. He, he, he gaslights Jo's life and he succeeds because Joab goes to

275
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:44.620
the king and he says that rotten son of yours just lit my field on fire. You've got to do something

276
00:46:44.629 --> 00:46:45.250
about this

277
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.330
and guess what it works.

278
00:46:52.419 --> 00:46:54.820
Epsilon gets to come back

279
00:46:59.139 --> 00:47:03.989
and David says because of how you did it, I'm still not gonna talk to you

280
00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:10.989
but you get to come back because you hurt my friend, joy.

281
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:22.649
And so God allows this situation to continue and he allows it to continue because epsilon is a

282
00:47:22.659 --> 00:47:24.479
lesson in how

283
00:47:27.889 --> 00:47:31.800
the outcome always justifies the means.

284
00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:41.110
It doesn't matter how you succeed, doesn't matter who you have to climb over to get to your success.

285
00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:46.610
It doesn't matter what you did to win. It doesn't matter what you did to have that extra money. It

286
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:52.280
doesn't matter what you did to get. That contract doesn't mean that you did it all wrong, but you

287
00:47:52.290 --> 00:48:00.590
did enough wrong where you know it was wrong enough. But the outcome justified the means because we

288
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.649
live in a world in which this is how the world operates. This is how everybody does business. This

289
00:48:05.659 --> 00:48:11.260
is how everybody makes choices. And if you make them differently than everybody else, then that just

290
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:16.540
means that you're gonna be the person who's always going to be left out of the equation of what it

291
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:22.540
means to be successful. Others will get ahead. Others will have success. Others will succeed. But it

292
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:30.179
won't be you because you just won't play by the world's rules. And we believe that

293
00:48:33.899 --> 00:48:41.770
and that's exactly what happened to epsilon because guess what, he set a guy's field on fire and

294
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:51.330
what happened? The king let him come back home. It worked. And so because it worked doesn't that

295
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.500
sometimes motivate us to keep doing the same thing

296
00:48:56.179 --> 00:49:01.000
because it was successful because it turned out to be the right thing to do in the end. You see, if

297
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:05.120
I hadn't have done it this way, well, then this wouldn't have happened. And so we look at the

298
00:49:05.129 --> 00:49:11.419
outcome and we say, well, it doesn't matter how I did it, the outcome is what matters and, and

299
00:49:11.429 --> 00:49:20.800
that's how we allow our minds and hearts to be corrupted by the outcomes instead of doing that,

300
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.790
which is right.

301
00:49:24.899 --> 00:49:31.209
And God wants us to be so much better than that. Don't you want to be better than that?

302
00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:41.300
I, I don't want to be like everybody else even when the tendency is so strong. And it's, it's so

303
00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:48.110
clear that I can be, it's the opportunity sitting right there, you know, iii I can just take it,

304
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:54.689
seize it, just run with it, go with it, experience everything I need to have so that I can just have.

305
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:04.459
But God is saying no, there's, there's a way in which you can have But let me be the one who guides

306
00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:11.209
you who blesses you and brings it into your life in a way that isn't detrimental to other people.

307
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:15.179
Job's field was still burnt.

308
00:50:17.239 --> 00:50:26.100
How is that a good outcome for Jo? See when God blesses your life, other people don't suffer, other

309
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:33.530
people don't pay the price for your success. You don't get ahead at the expense of other people

310
00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.030
because that's not how God works.

311
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:45.080
God works in a way that you get to go ahead. Have success, be blessed, have more, be more,

312
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:50.719
accomplish more and go on to accomplish even greater things. As long as you take care of all the

313
00:50:50.729 --> 00:50:57.379
people in your life that you come across, that God has put on your path as a test of your moral

314
00:50:57.389 --> 00:50:58.739
fiber and character.

315
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:08.340
And He puts you in a position where you can always make a choice where it can be at their expense,

316
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:14.739
but at your success and then He watches and waits to see what you're going to do. And whenever you

317
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:21.310
choose the outcome that is best for someone else and you serve them and you love them and you help

318
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:26.350
them and you care about them and you worry about them and you pray for them and you make sure that

319
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:32.330
they get ahead too. Then God looks at you and says, this is a person I can bless with more success.

320
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:42.790
This is a person of moral and character fiber that is blessing the lives of those around him and

321
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:49.570
around her and is someone that I want to get behind and I want them to go all the way and make a

322
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:55.659
difference in this world like no one has ever seen before. Don't you want to be that person? Don't

323
00:51:55.669 --> 00:52:01.560
you want to be that person so that God can choose you? But you got to choose yourself to be that

324
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:03.340
person so that He can choose you.

325
00:52:05.949 --> 00:52:12.810
And as we make those choices, and the Bible tells us that we have to live differently. Here's,

326
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:20.840
here's another one I want to share with you. It's about living only by the advice that I like.

327
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:35.159
Like II, I, I'm always uh you're pulled into the gravitational orbit of a person who agrees with me,

328
00:52:35.169 --> 00:52:45.159
anybody else. So the more they agree with me, the more they align with me and the more I love them,

329
00:52:47.229 --> 00:52:49.360
uh the more I want to spend time with them,

330
00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:56.689
you know, I just, I just talk and I just hear them just, just repeating the same things back to me.

331
00:52:56.699 --> 00:53:04.790
I just love it. That's a good point. That's what I want. That's what I want. You know, I don't want,

332
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.159
I don't want disagreement. I don't want people to disagree with me, you know, II, I want people to

333
00:53:10.169 --> 00:53:16.139
just mirror me. That's it. Mirror my thinking, mirror my life, mirror the way that I make my choices,

334
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:21.439
the way that I view the world and the way that I view circumstances and situations and the way that

335
00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:27.860
when I ask for advice, they're, they're always telling me that, that the, that the, the battle

336
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:32.489
already is one that it's, it's just ahead of me, that greater things are in store for me. The best

337
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:37.290
is yet to come that, that there's nothing I have to change. It's not me. It's them, it's, that's

338
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:43.179
what I want to hear more of anybody else. Come on, think about it. The moment someone begins to

339
00:53:43.189 --> 00:53:49.500
disagree with us and push into us and test our theories and test our morality and then just

340
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:55.669
challenge our character and look at our choices more profoundly and say like, what is the motivation

341
00:53:55.679 --> 00:54:00.969
behind this? That's the moment we're like, what are you, what are you doing right now? I thought we

342
00:54:00.979 --> 00:54:05.949
were just gonna hang out and have drinks. What's this? What is this? Why does everything have to be

343
00:54:05.959 --> 00:54:07.350
an argument in a fight with? You?

344
00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:17.719
Can't, you just agree with me and let's get along right? Why, why, why does that happen? It happens

345
00:54:17.729 --> 00:54:24.929
because everybody has advisors in their life, everybody has counselors and, and, and people that we

346
00:54:24.939 --> 00:54:31.250
go to, we turn to people that we open up before and people that we think have wisdom for life. But,

347
00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:37.570
but sometimes what they have is just more of what we already are and, and they don't challenge

348
00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:44.209
anything and they don't hear from God on and speak into our lives from the scriptures because they

349
00:54:44.219 --> 00:54:50.500
don't know the scriptures because they don't have any advice to give from the scriptures. They, they

350
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.560
have advice to give from tiktok. That's it.

351
00:54:56.149 --> 00:54:57.879
There's this guy I follow.

352
00:55:00.929 --> 00:55:08.169
This is really amazing lady that she's told. Every time she speaks, speaks to my heart. All I'm

353
00:55:08.179 --> 00:55:11.370
gonna forward this to you. It's gonna change your life.

354
00:55:14.959 --> 00:55:15.649
I can

355
00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.679
mainly not but it can

356
00:55:24.139 --> 00:55:29.830
II, I always tell people the only good things I have to say come from God's word.

357
00:55:31.949 --> 00:55:36.370
The only wisdom I have to share is, is come from the scriptures. First. You don't want my wisdom. My

358
00:55:36.379 --> 00:55:37.290
wisdom is no good.

359
00:55:39.989 --> 00:55:45.080
My, my life experience the things that I've learned. I can, I can tell you a few things but it's not

360
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:50.820
enough for you to go on. Does that make sense? Because your life is unique, you, you're uniquely

361
00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:57.570
designed and your purpose is, is just unique to itself. II, I can't speak into your life just from

362
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:08.689
my life. But I, but I could speak from something higher by which all things have to be compared to

363
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:18.929
and discerned by judged and analyzed for. And that is the wisdom of God. And when we turn to the

364
00:56:18.939 --> 00:56:26.199
wisdom of God, it moves us beyond the advice that we like. And it moves us into a place where it's

365
00:56:26.209 --> 00:56:33.719
the advice that we need to live a life that is full I, I wanna live a life that's full. I want to

366
00:56:33.729 --> 00:56:39.100
live a life that's filled with meaning that, that leads me to better things. But more importantly,

367
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:44.139
it leads me to a better version of myself. Anybody else want to be a better version of themselves.

368
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:50.949
It's not just the better things I want, I believe, I believe I, I want those things just as much as

369
00:56:50.959 --> 00:56:58.080
you do. But I also need, I really desperately need to want to be a better person

370
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:08.100
and, and God wants to help us be the better person so we can help us to get the best experiences.

371
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:23.260
So in second Samuel Epsilon, you know, he's, he manages to, to get control. It's kind of crazy, but

372
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:31.260
he does and, and the advisers of the king are starting to become his advisors and there's two

373
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:38.250
opposing opinions and, and in this story that we're in now, um David is kind of like he's getting

374
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:43.090
ready for his coup. He's, he's gonna take over, he's gonna take over control of the kingdom. He's

375
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.870
gonna, he's gonna win a battle that doesn't even need to be fought because David doesn't want to

376
00:57:47.879 --> 00:57:53.350
fight it, but he's going to win it anyways. And he's getting advice on how to do it. And it's

377
00:57:53.360 --> 00:58:03.969
interesting because in verse 23 it says that epsilon followed 1/5 of fell's advice and just as David

378
00:58:03.979 --> 00:58:12.360
had done and every word that a Fiel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the

379
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:16.000
mouth of God except there's a problem. Um,

380
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:24.790
a file for you guys that may not know this is, is, is bath Sheba's grandfather

381
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:35.070
that the reason people are going, oh ma is because they know the story that Baba is, is the woman

382
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:44.409
who David had an affair with and killed his husband so that he could take her as his wife

383
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.280
and the advisor

384
00:58:53.379 --> 00:59:02.250
who speaks as though he's speaking from. God finally gets his chance to stab David in the back.

385
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:10.159
Isn't that pretty crazy? And so he gets the opportunity to now promote his son absalon at the

386
00:59:10.169 --> 00:59:16.679
expense of David. And he takes it, he seizes it and he tells him what to do and he tells them two

387
00:59:16.689 --> 00:59:22.239
crazy things to do. We can't get into it. It, it would take too much time. But I want you to know

388
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:31.850
that he's listening to the advice of, of this man except that David had his own as advisor, another

389
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:41.969
man and his name was Khai and remains faithful to David. And, and, and when David leaves to go and

390
00:59:41.979 --> 00:59:50.389
hide in a cave again, even though he had already done that when he was being chased by Saul, he

391
00:59:50.399 --> 00:59:57.020
doesn't want to fight for the kingdom. He doesn't want to fight for, against epsilon. And David is

392
00:59:57.030 --> 01:00:01.399
the kind of guy that God wants me to be king. I'll still be king tomorrow, but I'm not going to be

393
01:00:01.409 --> 01:00:11.110
the one who goes out and puts my own people against my own people. When my king might be God's

394
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:19.909
choice, when my son might be God's choice to be king. And so he decides to leave and says, I'm gonna

395
01:00:19.919 --> 01:00:28.149
come with you and, and, and he says to you can't come, you'd be of greater service to me if you stay

396
01:00:28.159 --> 01:00:36.270
behind. I, I don't know how God's gonna use you. He says, but, but he says this in verse 14, then

397
01:00:36.409 --> 01:00:44.459
epsilon and all the men of Israel said hashes advice is better. Then atolls for the Lord had

398
01:00:44.469 --> 01:00:53.570
determined look at this to defeat the council of atoll, which really was the better plan so that he

399
01:00:53.580 --> 01:01:02.610
could bring disaster on epsilon. And I want you to see that even though everyone is behind epsilon

400
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:15.320
and the better plan is revealed to epsilon. David says, I am going to pray that somehow a Fi's

401
01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:20.129
advice is ignored by my son

402
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:26.639
and that God would be in control instead.

403
01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:36.689
And I want you to imagine that sometimes we have wise people giving us advice. But if God doesn't

404
01:01:36.699 --> 01:01:40.729
want your plan to succeed, here's what's going to happen. Your plan is not going to succeed.

405
01:01:44.729 --> 01:01:50.540
Listen, you could have the best counselors and the best plan. But if God isn't in it, guess what

406
01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:57.229
your plan will not succeed. That's what this is saying. Who wants God in their plans? Who wants

407
01:01:57.239 --> 01:02:04.820
their plans? To succeed. I do, I don't want to listen to good advice to wise counsel and then just

408
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:13.060
simply, just do the opposite of what God wants. I would rather do what God wants and succeed than

409
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:18.860
listen to people and just get the wrong advice. Has anyone in this room ever at any point? Just

410
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:19.959
gotten bad advice.

411
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:28.379
And I don't mean just from yourself. You know, I, I, you know, I, I can't trust my gut. I don't know

412
01:02:28.389 --> 01:02:35.629
about you. But sometimes in my gut, I just know this is right or this is wrong honestly. Like there

413
01:02:35.639 --> 01:02:41.570
are times where my gut has deceived me. There are times when my heart has deceived me. There, there

414
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:47.929
are times when I've, when I've deceived myself because II I just wasn't outside of it enough. You

415
01:02:47.939 --> 01:02:56.639
know what I mean? I, I was too in it to really see it and, and I just believed so strongly that it

416
01:02:56.649 --> 01:03:03.469
would happen and then discovered that it didn't and, and, and, and the devastating consequences of

417
01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:10.709
that were, were horrific. What God is trying to tell us is that, hey, don't live only by the advice

418
01:03:10.719 --> 01:03:19.250
that you like because this is what happens. He listens to shy but hush, like gave him the wrong

419
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.340
advice. But it was the one that he liked more. So, you know what happens to a, a

420
01:03:27.939 --> 01:03:29.750
he goes home and he kills himself.

421
01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.370
I mean, they're sticking things hard and then

422
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:47.000
I don't want to make fun of suit. I just did, but I'm sorry about that. But it, he took it so badly

423
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:54.580
that his advice wasn't taken that he's like, this is my only chance. It was my only chance to get

424
01:03:54.590 --> 01:04:00.040
this right and I got it wrong and, and, and I, I honestly, this scripture doesn't say why he took

425
01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:05.810
his own life. But I believe two things happened here. One is that he realized that epsilon was gonna

426
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:13.889
fail, but two, he realized that he also failed. And there was no coming back from that because he

427
01:04:13.899 --> 01:04:20.159
had gone against the king. Does that make sense? So he took his own life fearing that David would

428
01:04:20.169 --> 01:04:20.699
take his

429
01:04:22.929 --> 01:04:27.860
and, and this is what happens when we, we don't follow the advice that that God wants us to take.

430
01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:38.360
Listen, I, we only get wiser when we spend more time with those who are wise because of God's wisdom

431
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:45.709
and the more wisdom we acquire from God, the wiser we become when someone is speaking, we can then

432
01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:50.729
start to see the contradictions. You know, we always talk about red flags, especially in dating you

433
01:04:50.739 --> 01:04:56.830
guys, right? That's a red flag. That's a red flag, right? Everything is a red flag these days. There

434
01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:03.320
are no green flags anywhere for anybody. They're just all red. Have you noticed that? It's like, I

435
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:08.479
don't know who, no wonder everybody is still single. It's like you can, how can you possibly, you

436
01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:14.030
know, find the right person when you're seeing red flags all the time. You're not even giving a

437
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.100
person a chance, you're not even giving them an opportunity. You're not even letting feelings grow.

438
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:25.419
You're just automatically discarding them. Why am I talking about this so strongly now? I don't know,

439
01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:31.560
but I feel like there's always a dating advice thing I can do every Sunday. Does everybody agree. I,

440
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:39.419
I think so. even if it's kind of off topic, it's always on topic. You know. So here's what happens

441
01:05:39.429 --> 01:05:51.219
in the story. This story is about how things can so go in a manner that goes opposite of the wisdom

442
01:05:51.229 --> 01:05:58.270
that God has to offer us. And so don't just listen to anybody's advice, listen to God's. Here's the

443
01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:05.909
fourth thing things happen because I make them happen. Now, the thing about absalon is in second

444
01:06:05.919 --> 01:06:14.000
Samuel chapter 15 verses 1 to 6. It says that after this absalon bought a chariot and horses and he

445
01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:16.590
hired 50 bodyguards to run ahead of him.

446
01:06:20.669 --> 01:06:26.310
And then he got up early every morning and he went out of the gate of the city. And when people

447
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.949
brought a case to the king for judgment, epsilon would ask them, hey, where in Israel are you from?

448
01:06:31.959 --> 01:06:37.129
And they would tell him their tribe. And then Epsilon would say, oh, you've got a really strong case

449
01:06:37.139 --> 01:06:44.219
here. It's too bad that the king doesn't have anyone to hear it. I wish I were the judge. Then

450
01:06:44.229 --> 01:06:50.209
everyone could bring their cases to me for judgment and I would give them justice and then people

451
01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:56.469
tried to bow before him, but Aon wouldn't let them instead, he would take them by the hand and he

452
01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:03.419
would kiss them, stand up and he would hug them and kiss them. And as an equal, and the Bible says

453
01:07:03.429 --> 01:07:10.870
that Abs did this with everyone who came to the king for judgment. And so he stole the hearts of all

454
01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:21.889
the people of Israel. Now, uh we need to put a verse one again because I love this one. He bought a

455
01:07:21.899 --> 01:07:30.800
chariot and he hired 50 bodyguards to run ahead of him just like the president does. He had the, the

456
01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:34.689
first, the first secret police right here.

457
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:42.360
That, that, that's what he did. Listen, there's no one who looks more important than someone who

458
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:48.219
goes anywhere with 50 people ahead of him. You ever wonder why people travel with entourages because

459
01:07:48.229 --> 01:07:51.000
the more you have people around you, the more important you look

460
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:56.520
the first person to do this BS was epsilon

461
01:07:58.899 --> 01:08:04.939
and we're seeing this all the time now because because you can believe your own hype, you understand

462
01:08:04.949 --> 01:08:10.850
what's going on here. You want to be king, you can be king. All you need is 100 and 50 people to run

463
01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:11.409
ahead of you.

464
01:08:14.389 --> 01:08:18.930
Maybe not a chair, maybe an escalade, I guess. But you get it right.

465
01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:28.470
You want to, you want to build a reputation, you can go ahead, build your following. Do it amazing.

466
01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:38.540
But guess what? None of it means anything because in the story, he says this is not gonna happen on

467
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:44.029
its own. So you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make it happen. I'm not going to wait to be king.

468
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.379
I am gonna crown myself king before I am king and every person that comes to me, I'm going to tell

469
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:55.750
them that I'm a king. I'm gonna live like a king. I am going to walk around like a king. Actually,

470
01:08:55.759 --> 01:09:01.009
other people will walk around and I'll just write in my chariot. But I'll make sure that everybody

471
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:06.330
sees me as a king because anybody who asks when they say who's the king in Israel, they're not going

472
01:09:06.339 --> 01:09:12.458
to say David, they're going to say absalon. I mean, he's not king but man, he should be king because

473
01:09:12.469 --> 01:09:17.068
when I tried to kneel in front of him and kiss his hand, he just pulled me right up and he kissed me

474
01:09:17.079 --> 01:09:24.200
on my cheeks instead. See he built his own reputation. He took his own opportunity. He created his

475
01:09:24.209 --> 01:09:30.359
own outcome. Guys, we think that the world is always made by those who take it by force, but that's

476
01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:36.220
one form of success. But it's the one that ends like Epsilon's life. And God is saying that's not

477
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:42.859
what I want for you. That's not how I want you to live. Things don't just happen because you make

478
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:49.999
them happen, things happen because I'm with you. God is saying because I put my favor on your life.

479
01:09:50.008 --> 01:09:55.449
I didn't just give you grace. I gave you favor. I didn't just give you this which doesn't look like

480
01:09:55.458 --> 01:10:02.160
a lot. But if you give it back to me, I can multiply it and I can do so much more with everything

481
01:10:02.169 --> 01:10:09.080
that you have, That something can become something more and it can be a blessing not only to you but

482
01:10:09.089 --> 01:10:14.660
to those around you. But what you've got to trust me for it. Are you ready to do that to trust the

483
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:20.540
Lord? Like never before and not live according to the tactics that other people have lived by and

484
01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:24.959
the things that even someone like epsilon has done, we're gonna wrap things up with the fifth one

485
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:29.229
and it's here. It's that more is always more in the story

486
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:36.419
and I, I feel like we're in this season where we can just have it all. And when we don't, it's

487
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:43.160
really hard for us more is never a bad thing. We think it's like, do we just want more of the same

488
01:10:43.169 --> 01:10:49.089
or more of, of something else? But more is always more. Why would we think of more as being less?

489
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:54.930
Well, here's the thing in Second Samuel. The Bible tells us that we, that Epsilon had a lot of hair.

490
01:10:54.939 --> 01:10:58.939
Remember the story that when he, when he cut it for the first time that they would actually weigh it

491
01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:04.299
and he would do this once a year. Well, the Bible tells us that his hair finally gets him into

492
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:10.189
trouble. That vanity and him believing his own height. Look at what happens that during the battle

493
01:11:11.009 --> 01:11:16.509
in Second Samuel in chapter 18 verses nine and 10, that epsilon happened to come upon some of

494
01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:22.310
David's men and he tried to escape on his mule. But as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great

495
01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:29.890
tree, his hair got caught in the tree and his mule kept going and left him dangling in the air. And

496
01:11:29.899 --> 01:11:37.600
one of David's men saw what had happened and told Joab, I saw epsilon dangling from a great tree and

497
01:11:37.609 --> 01:11:40.509
he said, what did you do? He was like nothing. I came to tell you about it.

498
01:11:44.529 --> 01:11:49.899
It's like what you could have been recognized as the greatest warrior in the history of Israel. Why

499
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:55.310
did you come back and tell me he goes, he goes, I don't care what you could have given me in terms

500
01:11:55.319 --> 01:12:02.839
of gold or silver or accolades. There's nothing in this world that would let me raise my hand

501
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:09.390
against the king's son. So even though epsilon is just super vulnerable in this moment, no one's

502
01:12:09.399 --> 01:12:19.000
doing anything about it except the Bible says the job goes up to epsilon and he says, this is where

503
01:12:19.009 --> 01:12:28.560
it ends for you. And he stabs him with a small dagger in his heart and he kills him right there. But

504
01:12:28.569 --> 01:12:35.779
don't feel bad for epsilon because Epsilon thought about his future even before this moment. And it

505
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:40.799
says here in Second Samuel chapter 18, verse 18, that during his lifetime while Abs was still alive,

506
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:43.419
he built a monument to himself. All right,

507
01:12:47.729 --> 01:12:50.299
he built a monument to himself in the King's valley

508
01:12:52.959 --> 01:12:57.509
said I have no son to carry on my name. So I want everyone to know that I was a great king. He

509
01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.290
wasn't even king.

510
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:06.100
And, and, and guess what happens? The monument becomes a mockery.

511
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:14.490
And every time someone sees the statue of Epsilon, all they see is the folly. The five things that

512
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:23.830
he did that made him Israel's greatest lost opportunity of what a life well lived could have been

513
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:33.279
instead of averting every tragedy. He walked right into each one. And God is saying, hey, I don't

514
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:41.600
want that for you. Can we learn from Epsilon today and not walk in those footsteps? I want to

515
01:13:41.609 --> 01:13:49.200
conclude with this verse in Proverbs 25 28. It says that a person without self control is like a

516
01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:50.779
city with broken down walls.

517
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:57.790
God is just saying like, I don't want that to be you. I don't want that to be your life. I don't

518
01:13:57.799 --> 01:14:02.890
want that to be your legacy no matter what your monuments look like. The ones you built to yourself.

519
01:14:02.899 --> 01:14:08.669
Listen, they're just gonna be mockeries of the life it could have been and it should have been. And

520
01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:15.819
what would have been if you had just stayed faithful to me? Can we turn our attention to God instead

521
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:21.430
of the patterns of wisdom in this world and turn to the wisdom of God instead, learn from this story,

522
01:14:21.439 --> 01:14:28.450
apply these principles and let's avert the great tragedies so that we can experience his great

523
01:14:28.459 --> 01:14:34.629
blessings since then. Thank you so much for listening guys. I really appreciate you. Yeah,

524
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:44.189
I know that was a super long message. I went double time. Well, not quite but just about, but you

525
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:50.930
know, sometimes you're gonna have to let me do this like once every quarter, just like let me go,

526
01:14:50.939 --> 01:15:00.250
just let me go. That's what me going looked like 48 minutes, sorry about that. But I hope it was

527
01:15:00.259 --> 01:15:03.290
still a blessing. Was that ok? Ok. Ok.

528
01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:13.979
Um Are you guys ready to stand and we're gonna sing a song together and as we do this, um I just

529
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:18.799
want to share uh before this song comes up, it's gonna do some really quick announcements. One you

551
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:11.029
let's sing this song together and then you guys can hang out at the cafe. Thank you for being here

552
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:17.169
today for being a part of our first Sunday in October. Can you believe it's October? It's not crazy,

553
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:22.160
unbelievable and the weather is amazing. It's like I just feel like it's gonna be like this until

554
01:17:22.169 --> 01:17:23.959
February. Anybody else believe that.

555
01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:31.629
I don't know, we can ask for it. Lord, please let's forget for a moment. We're living in Montreal,

556
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:40.359
right? Father, you love each of us and you want us to make good choices. You don't want us to be a

557
01:17:40.379 --> 01:17:46.689
city with broken down walls. You want us oh Lord, to be people of, of high moral fiber and character

558
01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:52.870
and to be filled with your wisdom and, and to avoid these pitfalls and, and I pray that today would

559
01:17:52.879 --> 01:17:57.250
be a day in which we would honor you. Thank you for every person that is here today, for the

560
01:17:57.259 --> 01:18:01.740
blessing that you are to them and for the great things that you're gonna do in them and through them.

561
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:07.950
Thank you, Lord. You're an amazing God. We can trust you with all of it. And as we would put our

562
01:18:07.959 --> 01:18:14.990
faith and trust in you and not, and anyone else to, to any higher measure than you than Lord, I know

563
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.040
that we will succeed. And so I pray that you would bless each person here with your success, that

564
01:18:21.049 --> 01:18:27.939
you would fulfill their desires and, and meet their needs, that you would expand or God their vision

565
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:33.020
for their future and, and that you would help them to create it with you. And we pray these things

566
01:18:33.029 --> 01:18:38.439
in jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Let's sing this song and after that we're dismissed.

592
01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:07.990
You may be seated.
