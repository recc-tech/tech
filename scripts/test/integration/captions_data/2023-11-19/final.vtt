1
00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.179
I am seeking,

2
00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:30.160
searching for the things this world has rejected, the things that are broken that are flawed, thrown

3
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.099
away and discarded.

4
00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:43.059
I seek the lost, the damaged, the forgotten things, the overlooked and the neglected,

5
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.510
the things that have been pushed aside and left behind.

6
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.090
Why, why do I do this?

7
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.789
Why? Chase after that, which is despised by so many.

8
00:09:10.729 --> 00:09:19.619
It is because I have chosen to reject it. I bring restoration to the broken. I see beyond the flaws

9
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:26.919
and the imperfections and I bring new life to the loss. This world has called them useless and

10
00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:30.979
garbage, hopeless and unwanted.

11
00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:43.340
They have been scarred, abused, ignored and unloved, but I, I have reclaimed them and they belong to

12
00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:52.440
me now. They are my masterpiece and I have a plan and a future for every single one

13
00:09:56.219 --> 00:10:03.549
for. I am crafting these dissonant and discarded pieces into something beautiful.

14
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:28.469
Hey, good morning. River's edge. How are you this morning? Good, good. Yeah, super. I'm really happy

15
00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:35.030
to be with you uh this morning. Um A real privilege. We have a wonderful gathering prepared for you.

16
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:44.400
Uh We also want to welcome people that are uh seeing us from the clouds somewhere virtually uh in

17
00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:49.750
the uh it world. So let's um, welcome them this morning.

18
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.770
Hi, cloud people. So, uh, but for those of you who are here this morning, uh, we have the

19
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:06.729
opportunity to, uh also enjoy some good time of refreshment this morning and do uh also a moment of

20
00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:11.890
exchange and to be able to, uh, know each other a little bit better. So can't wait to see you

21
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:18.262
eventually for those who are looking uh from home this morning. So I just want to remind you that uh

22
00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:24.831
at 10, there's a meeting for the youth that is starting. So the youth are meeting from 10 to 1030

23
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:32.692
each Sunday morning. And also at 1030 obviously, we have our kids ministry that is happening right

24
00:11:32.702 --> 00:11:40.252
here in the annex. So uh use that opportunity, there's wonderful uh message and activities, prepare

25
00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:47.513
for your kids. So we want welcome you warmly this morning uh in other churches sometimes and in my

26
00:11:47.523 --> 00:11:53.564
church history, uh we were doing some kind. Oh, I forgot about the disclaimer. So that's really

27
00:11:53.573 --> 00:12:00.533
important. Uh I've been told that it's important to say before when I'm doing the MC things that I'm

28
00:12:00.544 --> 00:12:06.955
not always serious and that you need to exercise your judgment at all time. Ok. So please please

29
00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:13.125
filter everything that I'm saying. Ok, so that's being said, it's, it needs to be applied for

30
00:12:13.135 --> 00:12:18.265
everything I'm saying, but it's not about the message and neither the worship. Ok. The disclaimer is

31
00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:24.356
done. So having said that in, in my past church history, what we were doing, there was some kind of

32
00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:30.705
uncomfortable moments where we were uh seeing welcome for the newcomers and they were asking them to

33
00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:35.328
waive the answer or something like that. And we were feeling some kind of pleasant, guiltiness and

34
00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:41.427
all these activity and awkwardness being welcome with that. So that practice has obviously been

35
00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:47.297
banished from every churches since then. So what we're gonna do here at River Judge, we wanna push

36
00:12:47.307 --> 00:12:53.658
that awkwardness to another level and for every newcomer will ask you to come in front here and give

37
00:12:53.668 --> 00:13:02.010
your testimony. So what do you think? What do you think about that? Obviously, it's a joke.

38
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:09.070
Seriously. If you're a newcomer here, we just wanna welcome you warmly. Uh We won't push any awkward

39
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:16.500
moment uh for you. We just want you to feel that place home and uh enjoy a cup of coffee at the end

40
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:24.280
of the gathering and we just wanna know you a little bit better and uh hope that you'll find a place

41
00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:30.799
in River's edge where you can um belong before you believe. So that's really the intent of that

42
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:37.099
community and to be able to go at your own rhythm in your spiritual journey and to know a little bit

43
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:43.440
better about Jesus, that's the only agenda we're having here. So, can you stand uh with me this

44
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:49.469
morning and welcome and be prepared to heat your hand a little bit. Ok. By Yeah, exactly. Welcome

45
00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:52.559
warmly. The Rivers worship team.

46
00:13:56.809 --> 00:14:04.369
Welcome. We are so excited to worship with you and we wanna begin by reading God's Word. Um As

47
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:10.409
Pastor Zoe continues the series on rejection and um you know, could bring up the pain that we felt

48
00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:16.580
from it. And, you know, at the same time, it points us to God's love and how he does not reject us.

49
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:23.229
So I wanted to read one of my favorite stories in the Bible that um reflects God's love. And I just

50
00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:31.940
realized I can't see. Ok. Um Jesus continue, this is in Luke chapter 15, Jesus continued. There was

51
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:38.280
a man who had two sons, the younger one said to his father, father give me my share of the estate.

52
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:44.200
So he divided his property between them. Not long after that, the younger son got together all he

53
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:50.960
had set off for a distant country and then squandered his wealth in wild living after he had spent

54
00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:56.750
everything. There was a severe famine in the whole country and he began to be in need. So he went

55
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.909
and hired himself out to a citizen of that country who sent him into the fields to feed pigs. He

56
00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:08.869
longed to fill his stom fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave

57
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.619
him anything when he re when he came to his senses. He said, how, how many of my father's hired men

58
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:21.760
have food to spare. And here I am starving to death. I will set out and go back to my father and say

59
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:27.520
to him, father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called

60
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:35.659
your son. Make me like one of your hired men. So he got up and went to his father. But while he was

61
00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:43.150
still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him. He ran to his son,

62
00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:48.940
threw his arms around him and kissed him. The son said to him, father, I have sinned against heaven

63
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:54.380
and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his servants

64
00:15:54.390 --> 00:16:00.330
quick, bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet,

65
00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:06.739
bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate for my, for this son of mine

66
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:12.969
was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. So they began to celebrate.

67
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.309
It's just amazing. Just let's just pray before we start, father, we just thank you so much for your

68
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:29.150
word that reflects and helps us to get to know your vast and tremendous love for us. Thank you that

69
00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:36.710
we are chosen and hand picked by you. Father. We thank you that we are always on our mind, on your

70
00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:43.729
mind. And I just pray for everyone here um that we would just have a fresh encounter with you today

71
00:16:43.979 --> 00:16:45.609
in Jesus name. Amen.

129
00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:14.569
Praise God. You may be seated.

130
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:46.459
Wow. What a wonderful worship time and amazing. Can we thank again our dedicated worship team this

131
00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:47.060
morning.

132
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:54.439
Um I've made a disclaimer, but I want to suspend that for a moment because I haven't imported

133
00:30:54.449 --> 00:31:02.780
information that is uh really serious this time. Uh It's um the will of Samantha and Nate uh for me

134
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:08.219
to uh share with you an information this morning for those of you who aren't uh knowing Nate and

135
00:31:08.229 --> 00:31:13.790
Samantha. It's a young couple that is deeply involved in that community, especially with the young

136
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:22.640
adults. Uh they were pregnant uh of uh five months a child and uh unfortunately, uh they lost that

137
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:30.500
child. Um So this morning, they wanted us to share with you that information uh but more importantly

138
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:36.930
also to support them in prayer uh for that moment that is obviously really painful for them and

139
00:31:36.939 --> 00:31:46.459
painful for us as well as a community. Um So additional information Samanta is, is doing good. She's

140
00:31:46.469 --> 00:31:53.000
at a good situation and that was really their will to share that kind of information uh this morning

141
00:31:53.010 --> 00:32:01.599
and to pray for them. So, uh would you mind to stand all together as one big family and as one body

142
00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:11.089
to support them and pray for them this morning? Thank you for uh standing. So Jesus, we're um so sad

143
00:32:11.099 --> 00:32:21.160
about this news this morning. And we want be compassionate with that young couple that we dearly

144
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:32.469
love. And we want to ask you your wonderful piece on them that incredible and difficult to

145
00:32:32.479 --> 00:32:39.910
understand and grasp in these difficult moment that, that peace may really be with them. Um And

146
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:49.140
that's currently the situation for them, but we just want you to be with them in that moment. Um We

147
00:32:49.150 --> 00:33:00.140
just praying as a one b as one church for that wonderful couple this morning and we pray that you be

148
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:08.729
with them in that moment. So in, in your name, we pray this morning. Amen. Amen. So you may uh take

149
00:33:08.739 --> 00:33:15.180
your seat. Um By the way, also, if you want to support uh if you want to support them in that moment,

150
00:33:15.189 --> 00:33:22.979
one of the way that we have identified is to uh cook, cook some meal. So, Carole, who was just here,

155
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:59.089
These are really uh for uh some child. Uh this morning is the last day that we're collecting those

156
00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:05.435
boxes So if you miss that opportunity today to bring the boxes, we are asking you to go on the

157
00:34:05.444 --> 00:34:14.824
website operation. It is summer written purse dot C where you can identify what is the nearest

158
00:34:14.834 --> 00:34:20.475
collection point. But today was the last day for the box. But if you already took a box and forgot

159
00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:26.294
to bring it, you can do that with the other collection point. So thank you so much. Also for your

161
00:34:33.319 --> 00:34:39.809
we're collecting uh some names for people that would be willing to serve with the Children, our kids

162
00:34:39.819 --> 00:34:47.729
ministry. So that's a wonderful opportunity uh to, to, to uh to teach and take care of our little

163
00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:53.024
ones. So if you have that on your heart and wanna know a little bit more about what this is

164
00:34:53.034 --> 00:35:00.084
involving exactly what you need to do. So use that opportunity at the end to seek for more

165
00:35:00.094 --> 00:35:08.804
information at the info booth. Talking about volunteering. There is uh an event on the 29th, 29th at

166
00:35:08.814 --> 00:35:18.449
630. This is our team night. Um We wanna thank you everyone that is volunteering to River's Edge by

167
00:35:18.459 --> 00:35:24.560
having that meal all together. So at 630 don't miss that opportunity. This is the team night. Uh

168
00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:31.449
Everyone that's volunteering at River's Edge is welcome there as well as anybody that would like to

169
00:35:31.459 --> 00:35:38.169
volunteer and be part of the different services that we're offering to the community. So if you're

170
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:45.449
not volunteering, but you consider doing so in the next couple of weeks, please attend to that team

171
00:35:45.459 --> 00:35:50.550
night. It will be a wonderful opportunity to know a little bit better about what are the different

172
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:58.100
teams and where you can serve. And obviously all these people that are serving in all these teams

173
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:05.310
are incredible people and it will be really exciting for you to meet those talented and joyful and

174
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:11.199
involved people. So there is no half measure for anybody that is serving in these teams. Uh There is

175
00:36:11.209 --> 00:36:18.649
a strong community sense and if you want to experience that, that's the best way uh by attending to

176
00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:29.820
that uh special, special night with uh the team night, last thing last but not least offerings and

177
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:36.510
the opportunity to support everything that we're doing here. Um There's many ways to serve in that

178
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:43.330
community as I just, as I just explained, but there's other way as well financially, you can support

179
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.465
us. And there's a different way that you've been able, that you are able to give to our community

180
00:36:48.475 --> 00:36:56.995
and be able to uh sustain all the expenses of that building and uh also the different ministry that

181
00:36:57.004 --> 00:37:03.590
we're offering. So we wanna thank you also for your generosity. We're not taking any of these

182
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.169
pennies for granted and any donation counts and we're deeply appreciative of everything that you're

183
00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:17.350
giving to that community either by your time or by your money. So it's obviously a total, uh there's

184
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:23.840
total freedom in that. So, but we also appreciate your donation having said that that was the last

185
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:29.610
announcement I have already explained that Christmas this year will be on December 24th. So it's not

186
00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.250
like Halloween where we can decide when it will happen. So I just wanted to announce that by the way,

187
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.879
it's always important as a reminder. So for those, are you planning to be late and celebrate

188
00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:45.110
Christmas? Maybe in, in late February? It's not possible this year. Ok. So that was the last

189
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.729
announcement. Ok. Having said that Lorenzo for those of you who aren't knowing that. So, our dear

190
00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:57.389
pastor Lorenzo is also a chaplain for different professional athlete uh here in Montreal like the

191
00:37:57.679 --> 00:38:07.010
Alouettes and we're gonna pray for the Owls right now. No, it's not. Mm So, uh so, so, so to the

192
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:13.820
surprise of everyone uh there at the Great Cup, Lorenzo is with them. Uh So, uh this morning he

193
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:20.350
prepared uh the, the, the switch from the series rejected. So we'll have the opportunity to have

194
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:29.290
Lorenzo with us virtually uh for the rejected series. So can we welcome Lorenzo warmly even if he

195
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.820
were virtually with us?

196
00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:33.919
Thank you.

197
00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:43.050
Hey, everyone. So glad that you could be here today at River's Edge as you notice, I'm not, uh I'm

198
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.320
here on the screen, but not here in person. I had to record this earlier in the week. And the reason

199
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:56.929
I did that is because I am actually at the Gray Cup 13 years of rejection season after season, we

200
00:38:56.939 --> 00:39:03.620
are finally in the Gray Cup uh final and uh the game is taking place in Hamilton. So later today,

201
00:39:03.629 --> 00:39:09.080
you'll know if we are great cup champions or not. But either way today, we are going to be

202
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:16.250
continuing with our series rejected. And today we're gonna be talking about a very poignant subject

203
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:23.889
and that's that of betrayal. I think at some point, we've all experienced betrayal or have been a

204
00:39:23.899 --> 00:39:32.540
betrayer. And this topic is very emotional for most of us and very meaningful because of the impact

205
00:39:32.729 --> 00:39:39.459
that it's obviously had, not just on ourselves but on others around us. We may be still living the

206
00:39:39.469 --> 00:39:47.610
effects of that betrayal. And when we do, we experience it long term, this is not something that we

207
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:54.689
can just overcome. It has a tendency to follow us just like it follows the life of these two

208
00:39:54.699 --> 00:40:04.820
disciples who rejected through betrayal. Jesus Jesus chose 12 and out of the 12. At some point, they

209
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:13.719
all rejected him. The two that we are most familiar with in terms of rejection are Judas. Of course,

210
00:40:13.729 --> 00:40:20.419
everyone's familiar with Judas. We even have a saying, don't be a Judas don't be like Judas and that

211
00:40:20.429 --> 00:40:26.719
kind of thing. But when we talk about betrayal, we often have to also talk about Peter, very

212
00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:35.820
different stories. But both of them happened at the time in jesus' life where he needed the

213
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:43.250
faithfulness of his 12. But we experience the story through the lens of their betrayal instead. So

214
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.939
we're gonna dive right into that and then we're gonna talk about this topic in a very transparent

215
00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:54.449
way so that we can also get to the bottom of maybe some of the things have been holding us back when

216
00:40:54.459 --> 00:41:02.729
it comes to rejection and being rejected and betrayal and the pain of all that. So we see that in

217
00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:10.909
the beginning, Jesus is choosing his disciples. And when he does, he obviously is aware of the

218
00:41:10.919 --> 00:41:20.560
prophecies regarding his choosing. And when he chooses someone like Peter and chooses someone like

219
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:27.590
Judas, he is aware that at some point they are going to betray him. And in fact, he's very clear on

220
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:34.590
when those moments are going to be. We see that in the case of Peter, he tells him before it even

221
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:42.159
happens that a rooster is going to crow three times and that Peter is going to deny Jesus in the

222
00:41:42.169 --> 00:41:50.870
case of Judas. He also says on a few occasions that one of them is going to betray him and that

223
00:41:50.879 --> 00:41:56.810
betrayal is going to lead not only to his arrest, but also to his crucifixion. And so Jesus has

224
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:03.149
knowledge of this before it occurs. I don't know about you, but I don't have that kind of knowledge

225
00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:08.969
of my own betrayals. I, I don't know if I'm going to be a betrayer or not, but there are certain

226
00:42:08.979 --> 00:42:16.110
things that I can look to just like I can in the life of Peter to better understand if I am on the

227
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:23.639
pathway of betrayal. There's certain things that Peter does that just don't sit right with him. And

228
00:42:23.649 --> 00:42:32.209
the first thing is that he is not happy with Jesus and the trajectory of his life and he doesn't

229
00:42:32.219 --> 00:42:39.030
just want to interfere, interfere in jesus' life. He, he doesn't like how things are working out for

230
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.860
his own. And so one of the things that we noticed right away from Peter is that when Jesus starts

231
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:51.399
talking about his death with Peter, doesn't want that to obviously happen. It's not the future or

232
00:42:51.409 --> 00:43:00.179
the outcome that he envisioned for himself. And so as a result, he really is against this. And when

233
00:43:00.189 --> 00:43:07.320
we get to the story of Peter, we see that it's something that he still doesn't want to happen.

234
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:17.310
That's why he brings a sword to the arrest of Jesus takes off the ear of the high priest's servant

235
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:24.350
servant gets in the way, protecting most likely the high priest, he loses his ear. And then we see

236
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:30.784
that Jesus takes it off the ground, puts it back on the servant's head and heals him and removes any

237
00:43:30.794 --> 00:43:37.854
of the consequences that would have pursued and followed Peter, possibly even leading, not only to

238
00:43:37.864 --> 00:43:47.504
his owner's arrest but his own death prematurely. And so Jesus comes, intervenes and restores the

239
00:43:47.514 --> 00:43:58.969
situation as if none of it happened. And yet Peter, still through all of this has been warned about

240
00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:03.919
his denial, but we haven't seen it yet. What we're seeing is a very courageous Peter. We're not

241
00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:09.590
seeing a Peter who's fearful. And so when we get to the scriptures, we're gonna see that there's a

242
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:21.830
moment in which Peter transitions from being ready to fight to someone who is taking flight, someone

243
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.649
who is not standing his ground like he did in the garden of get semi, but someone who's kind of like

244
00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:38.159
hanging back, observing from afar and not really following Jesus as closely as he's promised that he

245
00:44:38.169 --> 00:44:47.699
would. And so what we notice in this story is that there is in Peter's life, something that isn't

246
00:44:47.709 --> 00:44:54.649
right. Something that isn't going right. And as a result, something that doesn't go right. And so in

247
00:44:54.659 --> 00:45:02.739
Luke 22 and in verse 54 to 62 this is what we read. So they arrested him and they led him to the

248
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:11.810
high priest's home and then Peter followed at a distance. Then in verse 55 the guards, they lit a

249
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:19.979
fire in the middle of the courtyard and they sat around it. And then strangely enough, Peter joins

250
00:45:19.989 --> 00:45:27.219
them there, he sits with them. These are the people who just arrested Jesus or taking charge over

251
00:45:27.229 --> 00:45:34.530
him. And the outcome of what is to happen and he's hanging out with them. And then the third thing

252
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:41.510
we noticed is that there's a, a servant girl notices him in the firelight and began staring at him.

253
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:49.489
And then finally, she said this man was one of jesus' followers. And so here comes the first denial.

254
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:58.919
The first time that Peter betrays Jesus Peter denies it. And he says, woman, I don't even know him.

255
00:45:58.959 --> 00:46:06.010
Now, why would he do that? Why would he say that? He doesn't know Jesus if not out of self

256
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:14.229
protection. And so here's a second betrayal. It's happening around the same time and probably around

257
00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:21.030
that same fire. And it says that after a while someone else looked at him and said, you must be one

258
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:29.040
of them. And now it isn't a man, it isn't a woman. It's a man. And he says, no man, I'm not. Peter

259
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:37.699
retorted. And then the third betrayal. About an hour later, someone else insisted this must be one

260
00:46:37.709 --> 00:46:47.050
of them because he is a Galilean too. So they recognize him somehow from the region he was from. And

261
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:53.540
so Peter said, man, I don't know what you are talking about. And immediately while he was still

262
00:46:53.550 --> 00:47:01.439
speaking, the rooster crow, just as Jesus had predicted and prophesized over Peter's life. And it

263
00:47:01.449 --> 00:47:09.699
wasn't that Jesus was making sure this would happen. He was just aware that it would happen and

264
00:47:09.709 --> 00:47:17.429
that's different than, you know, manipulating someone into something, Jesus was just in his

265
00:47:17.439 --> 00:47:24.439
Foreknowledge, able to know what would occur, what would happen. And this is exactly how it plays

266
00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:31.909
out. He denies knowing Jesus on three occasions. I don't know about you, but there have been moments,

267
00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:38.709
I guess where we have not been very forthright about our faith. We kind of hidden back, maybe hung

268
00:47:38.719 --> 00:47:45.020
out with people and been around fires that we shouldn't have been around. When people asked us if we

269
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:52.709
knew Jesus, we may have denied knowing him and having had an encounter in a relationship with him,

270
00:47:52.979 --> 00:48:00.070
we betrayed him in our own way, maybe by not standing up when we knew that something needed to be

271
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:09.439
said, not doing when something needed to be done, not acting when action was required in those ways,

272
00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:18.419
we may have all been deniers, but also betrayers. And so we can really relate to what Peter is going

273
00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:24.489
through in this moment. It was something that was gonna be at risk for him. Now, it may not have

274
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:35.340
been the cross, but it was nonetheless a risk, a risk of risking the outcome that was no longer

275
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:43.070
preferred by Peter. I think that when we see that an outcome isn't gonna be favorable to us, that's

276
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:49.199
when we become betrayers. I think we calculate the cost. Like if I stand up here, if I say this and

277
00:48:49.209 --> 00:48:54.620
if I do this, you know, there's gonna be a cost to that. And I'm wondering if it's really worth it.

278
00:48:54.629 --> 00:49:01.090
And if I should, even though we know it's the right thing to do, we may not do it and we betray the

279
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:09.659
person, betray the situation. Sometimes it's like that in friendship, you know, we like to be with

280
00:49:09.669 --> 00:49:17.250
people who are well liked and if at some point they no longer are, we may deny knowing them just so

281
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:24.669
that, or being very close to them, or maybe even being related to them just because it no longer

282
00:49:24.679 --> 00:49:33.389
serves us. It's not in our favor to do so. There's no advantage. And so Peter was in a very similar

283
00:49:33.399 --> 00:49:40.639
position where being with Jesus now was a liability. I mean, why would you stand with someone who's

284
00:49:40.649 --> 00:49:50.110
a liability? Someone who is clearly not going to rise and be the king, someone who is not going to

285
00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:58.820
have a kingdom, someone who is going to give him position in that kingdom. And when we can't get

286
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:06.729
something out of it, when we can't gain an advantage from it, when we can't be everything that we

287
00:50:06.739 --> 00:50:18.469
want to be because of it, we may find ourselves with a tendency towards betrayal. Now, I'm not

288
00:50:18.479 --> 00:50:28.969
saying that all of us are out to seek our real. I'm not saying we're always thinking about how we

289
00:50:28.979 --> 00:50:37.489
can just, you know, take advantage of people, you can get the upper hand, you know, be in a position

290
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:44.149
that is advantageous, but you'd be surprised how we sometimes let things go unchecked in our hearts

291
00:50:44.159 --> 00:50:53.129
and in our lives to the point where when it matters most instead of doing the right thing. There, we

292
00:50:53.139 --> 00:51:01.520
are betraying for all the wrong reasons. And I believe that today is a day in which we can just

293
00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:08.050
examine ourselves and just wonder if, if this is true, but our own hearts, if, if this could be

294
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:13.479
hidden in Peter's heart and maybe just, maybe there might be a place where it's hiding in our own.

295
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:22.919
This isn't just about Peter today. It's about us and, and about whether or not that same possibility

296
00:51:22.929 --> 00:51:33.570
of betrayal is found within us. At some point in the story we read in verse 61 that it's at that

297
00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:47.229
very moment that the rooster crows that, that Jesus turns and looks at Peter like how mhm Weird is

298
00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:55.159
that like a like that's the moment, that's the moment like when I'm doing the worst possible thing,

299
00:51:55.290 --> 00:52:01.699
that's when you look at me like after I've denied you the three times, that's when you turn to me.

300
00:52:01.709 --> 00:52:07.340
That's when our eyes lock. That's when you see me. Like that's the time I wanna be the most hidden.

301
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:13.500
That's the time I wanna disappear. That's the time II I wanna make sure that I'm not seen. And

302
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:19.739
that's when you see me, you see the Lord is actually revealing that there's nothing that he doesn't

303
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:28.879
see that, that whether it's our best moments or whether it's our worst moment he sees it. And did

304
00:52:28.889 --> 00:52:35.840
you ever lock eyes with someone? And, and, and that was like that moment when you, you didn't want

305
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:42.540
that to happen. Well, that's exactly what happens here. Jesus locks eyes with Peter. And that's when

306
00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:50.419
he's at his absolute worst. That's when he is the most embarrassed about himself and his actions and,

307
00:52:50.429 --> 00:52:56.540
and what he's just done. And the Bible tells us that suddenly the Lord's words flashed through

308
00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:04.939
Peter's mind and before the rooster was even crowing tomorrow morning, he says, you will deny three

309
00:53:04.949 --> 00:53:13.159
times that you even know me. It's like in that moment when jesus' eyes locked with Peter, Peter

310
00:53:13.169 --> 00:53:19.820
remembers what Jesus said. He didn't remember it before when he was in the process of, of denying

311
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:25.350
him and betraying him the first time, denying and betraying him the second time, denying and

312
00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:31.110
betraying him the third time. But he remembers it when Jesus looks at him and I want you to know

313
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:39.239
that that's what God does is that he looks at us and he brings things to remembrance. He brings back

314
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:48.239
our memories so that we will look back on that moment and say, hey, I was warned about this. Hey, he

315
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:56.719
told me about this, hey, he spoke to my life already about this and I still went ahead and did it

316
00:53:56.729 --> 00:54:03.040
anyways. And I think that when we look back, we were gonna be able to look back with remorse with,

317
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:09.479
with, with repentance with a desire to have a renewed relationship with God. That's why he locks

318
00:54:09.489 --> 00:54:14.719
eyes with us, not just to bring it to our attention. So we feel bad and, and we just feel like

319
00:54:14.729 --> 00:54:23.770
betrayers, but he does it so that we can move forward from that place of betrayal. And have you

320
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:31.649
begin. And so in the story in which we're in talking about Peter, it then ends that Peter left the

321
00:54:31.659 --> 00:54:39.750
courtyard and he was weeping bitter bitterly. I mean, he just can't even be in the proximity of

322
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:46.199
Jesus anymore. I mean, you can't even follow him at a distance. He can't even be at a fire pit with

323
00:54:46.209 --> 00:54:53.189
everybody else just waiting for what the outcome is gonna be. He just realizes how he has betrayed

324
00:54:53.199 --> 00:55:02.530
Jesus himself and how he had been warned about it and how he went ahead and did it anyways. I have

325
00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:11.989
like you regrets, I have especially strong regrets about things that I had been warned about first.

326
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.949
And I don't think it's any different for Peter. I don't think it's any different for you. I think

327
00:55:16.959 --> 00:55:22.179
that when we've been warned about something and then we just find ourselves doing it anyway. The

328
00:55:22.189 --> 00:55:28.860
very thing we have been warned against, we can understand how we too would be in a position where

329
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:34.340
we're weeping bitterly. I, I don't know if this is something that you're still carrying, but I

330
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:41.879
imagine that you would be uh Peter carried it. I mean, he wasn't able to let it go until Jesus went

331
00:55:41.889 --> 00:55:48.429
and found him and restored him and spoke to him about a future that he could now still create

332
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:54.340
through a different set of choices. And so he offers him an options like, hey, you can still be a

333
00:55:54.350 --> 00:56:00.800
fisherman, go back to your old life and just forget about ever having been with me for 3.5 years and

334
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:08.620
being called an apostle or you can look after my people. You can look after the ones that I'm

335
00:56:08.629 --> 00:56:15.620
calling lambs and sheep and, and be their pastor and become a spiritual leader again because that's

336
00:56:15.629 --> 00:56:21.469
what I've called you to. And when, when Peter through his choices, understands that he made choices

337
00:56:21.479 --> 00:56:30.889
to betray, he can also make choices to help others have a new beginning. And I believe that God is

338
00:56:30.899 --> 00:56:36.379
doing the same thing here. He's telling us, hey, I don't want you to be in a position where you are

339
00:56:36.389 --> 00:56:42.979
living out your betrayal every day. I want you to have a new beginning and I wanna pray that God

340
00:56:42.989 --> 00:56:48.280
does exactly that he gives you that new beginning today just like he offered it to Peter. But it's

341
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:55.310
gonna have to come through a new set of choices. So Peter didn't like his choices. And so he

342
00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:02.620
betrayed Jesus to have better options. And sometimes we enter into betrayal because we're trying to

343
00:57:02.629 --> 00:57:10.239
create something better for us. But it's gonna be at the detriment of someone else. And in Peter's

344
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:17.560
case, he denies knowing Jesus because admitting that he knew him would not have been good for his

345
00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:24.070
future or his future choices. So he thought, let me deny him because that's gonna look better for me.

346
00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:30.280
That's gonna be better for me. That's gonna ensure that I have better options. But it turns out that

347
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:35.429
that wasn't the case at all. You see when you turn your back on Jesus, when you betray the truth,

348
00:57:35.439 --> 00:57:42.320
when you betray the Lord, your life isn't better. It's worse. You don't feel freer. You just

349
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:47.989
experience more slavery and you experience it in ways that you never even thought were possible.

350
00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:55.189
Peter has to go back to his old life because well, what other option was there until Jesus showed

351
00:57:55.199 --> 00:58:03.689
him that he was able to take his repentance, take his new choice of once again being reconciled with

352
00:58:03.699 --> 00:58:09.929
Jesus and then he would have a different future altogether. And so you have that same option before

353
00:58:09.939 --> 00:58:15.560
you today. You don't have to live out the betrayals of the past, the denials that led to betrayals.

354
00:58:15.629 --> 00:58:21.149
You don't have to look at those choices and how it brought you to this point. You can instead think

355
00:58:21.159 --> 00:58:27.770
about the new choice that God is giving you right now. And so ask God for that choice, God, what's

356
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.169
the new choice that you're putting in front of me? What's the new option that you're putting before

357
00:58:32.179 --> 00:58:38.830
me that I can choose so that I can have a different future. So I don't have to keep reliving the

358
00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:46.850
denials that led to the betrayals that put me in a position of rejection. And God is saying I can do

359
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:53.030
that for you right now. But here's the choice. I'm asking you to make, choose me, choose my options,

360
00:58:53.159 --> 00:58:59.199
choose what I'm offering you. So ask the Lord for what that is. He will let you know he will reveal

361
00:58:59.209 --> 00:59:05.729
it. That's what he does. That's what he comes to reveal and he will reveal that to each of you. The

362
00:59:05.739 --> 00:59:11.250
second thing I wanna talk to you about is the price of betrayal. And, and in this case, we have to

363
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:19.860
go to the life of Judas that see everyone has a price and people often say this phrase, hey, name

364
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:27.300
your price. And when what they've offered hasn't been high enough or good enough, they'll say name

365
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:32.179
your price. And the reason they do that is because they want you to choose them. They want you to be

366
00:59:32.189 --> 00:59:39.100
convinced that making that choice is the best choice for you. Well, Judas was in a similar position

367
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:44.679
seeing that Jesus wasn't gonna become the king the way that he envisioned and saw the direction in

368
00:59:44.689 --> 00:59:50.350
which it was, was turning. He's like I'm gonna have to secure my own future here. And so you'll

369
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:59.399
notice that he starts to make choices about his future and his choices include actually finding out

370
00:59:59.409 --> 01:00:10.530
how much Jesus is worth if he betrays him. In fact, the scriptures tell us this, that Judas Iscariot

371
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:18.979
went to the high priest and he offers to deliver Jesus to them and ask them how much would this be

372
01:00:18.989 --> 01:00:31.550
worth? And then the payment of 30 pieces of silver is agreed upon in Matthew 26 and verse 14 to 16,

373
01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:43.159
he asks the question, how much will you pay me to pay me? How much, how much to betray Jesus to you?

374
01:00:43.899 --> 01:00:49.870
And so we get this idea that everyone has a price. There is something that we're all willing to do

375
01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:56.750
for a certain amount. Now, be faithful to your partner, be faithful to your business partner, be

376
01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:05.399
faithful to the person that you are doing this with or sell them out, you know, take the money, you

377
01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:13.790
do what you need to do for yourself so that you don't have to stay with the one who loses, but you

378
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:20.370
find a way of winning. I think the world is just conditioned to do this. I think we see this often

379
01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:27.040
and it's glamorized and it's kind of like just understood and accepted as a way of, of life. It's

380
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:31.760
just the way the world works. Just what happens. You have to think of yourself and you have to think

381
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:37.729
about what you can get out of this. You have to secure your own future. Well, this is exactly what

382
01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:47.090
Judas is doing in this story. So Judas is offered to be paid 30 pieces of silver. But we don't

383
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:53.399
always understand is that Judas actually offered to betray Jesus. They didn't come to Judas. Judas

384
01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:59.429
went to them and, and that's the worst part of the story is that Judas is the one who actually

385
01:01:59.439 --> 01:02:05.110
volunteers to do this. They didn't even have to like say, hey, who is it among the 12? That is the

386
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:11.760
most disgruntled, you know, who is the guy? You know, if we analyze just their body me mannerisms

387
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:16.540
and their facial features and, and when Jesus is teaching, who's the guy who's just standing just a

388
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:21.429
little bit further back from everybody else, like who's the guy that, you know, is in charge of the

389
01:02:21.439 --> 01:02:27.409
money person, who's the guy that seems to be more about the kingdom and less about the king, like

390
01:02:27.419 --> 01:02:33.260
they didn't even have to do any of that. There was no analysis necessary. Why? Because Judas

391
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:42.899
actually volunteered to betray Jesus. I think about how different that is from what we just saw and

392
01:02:42.909 --> 01:02:53.800
read and experienced from Peter's life. See, sometimes we deny Jesus in very subversive ways, kind

393
01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:59.590
of like Peter and other times we're just like blatantly all about it. Those are the two examples we

394
01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:06.419
have here and, and Judas is all about the betrayal and the Bible tells us that this happens because

395
01:03:06.939 --> 01:03:19.239
in Luke chapter 22 we discovered that um from that time on it says that Judas began looking for an

396
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:27.739
opportunity to betray Jesus. He was already looking for it. He didn't know how it was gonna happen,

397
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:33.800
but he knew that he was gonna do it. And the Bible tells us that he devises a plan and then tells

398
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:41.219
them this is what, what's gonna happen. He says I'm gonna betray Jesus with a kiss. So when I kiss

399
01:03:41.229 --> 01:03:48.590
him, that's the guy and that's the person that you're gonna take. Now to me again, I'm confused by

400
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.260
this because isn't it clear who Jesus is?

401
01:03:54.449 --> 01:04:02.500
So, so what is it about this moment where Judas has to betray Jesus with a kiss? Like, I mean, it's

402
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:08.760
clear who Jesus is. Everybody knows Jesus. It's, it's like, it's like the celebrity sighting you,

403
01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:15.520
you know, confuse him with someone else like he's the real deal. So why do you need to identify

404
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:22.719
Jesus with a kiss? I'll tell you why. Because up until this moment, you'll see that throughout the

405
01:04:22.729 --> 01:04:29.229
gospels. Every time they try to kill Jesus. Jesus always escaped and, and they don't even know how

406
01:04:29.239 --> 01:04:37.110
or why, but he always gets out of the situation that he's in, they tried to kill him, they tried to

407
01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.639
arrest him. They tried over and over and over again and they never succeeded. And sometimes it was

408
01:04:44.649 --> 01:04:51.510
like they almost couldn't recognize him and see who he was because God was making sure that their

409
01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.820
eyesight, their ear and what they were listening to the moment in which they were in was just

410
01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:03.959
shrouded and clouded so that they couldn't even make the right decisions in the moment that they had

411
01:05:03.969 --> 01:05:10.139
to make it just to make sure that Jesus only died one way and that was on the cross.

412
01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:18.929
And so there's this thing where they all believe that Jesus could escape, that Jesus could get away

413
01:05:18.939 --> 01:05:26.469
because he had done it so many times before. Except this time, there was gonna be a sign and the

414
01:05:26.479 --> 01:05:35.949
sign was gonna be Judas and he was gonna reject him, but he's gonna do it by not only seeking a

415
01:05:35.959 --> 01:05:46.570
selfishly better future, he was gonna reject Jesus with a kiss. Now, the, the kiss is important

416
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:57.479
because it's clear, this is uh a moment of great hypocrisy. I mean, the kiss is, is like expressing

417
01:05:57.489 --> 01:06:07.219
love for Jesus, but then it's also betraying him at the same time. I mean, the kiss is about a

418
01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:15.040
covenant bond of friendship, partnership. You know, brotherhood. It's like we're in this together.

419
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:22.439
It's this thing of, of, of deep meaningful greeting the people you love the most are the ones that

420
01:06:22.449 --> 01:06:30.479
you, you just greet with a kiss. It's a sign of deep respect and, and honor and love and, and that's

421
01:06:30.489 --> 01:06:31.840
why it's so

422
01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:43.320
OK, an inc it's just an incredible moment of betrayal to see Judas use the kiss in a moment in which

423
01:06:43.639 --> 01:06:53.639
he was just being the most fake about it. And maybe you've heard words of, of, of affection. You've

424
01:06:53.649 --> 01:07:01.860
been kissed, you've been shown a level of intimacy telling you that everything was fine. Only to

425
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:10.159
know that you had been betrayed or, or being betrayed all along that this act of faithfulness was

426
01:07:10.169 --> 01:07:23.030
just that of, it was a ruse. None of it was real. It was fake, it wasn't authentic. It was part of

427
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.500
an act, it was being done to get something out of you.

428
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:39.719
When all along they were just trying to get something for themselves and not doing something for you.

429
01:07:41.689 --> 01:07:52.030
It was the kind of betrayal that many of us in this room have experienced and may have been also the

430
01:07:52.040 --> 01:08:00.219
perpetrators of. And I want us to think about that for a moment because this betrayal by a kiss is

431
01:08:00.229 --> 01:08:09.239
something that many of us are still experiencing. The rejection of. Many of us are still just living

432
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:20.249
the consequences of that betrayal and the reality of that betrayal towards someone else. The Bible

433
01:08:20.258 --> 01:08:27.378
tells us this in Proverbs 27 6, it says wounds from a friend

434
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:40.490
can be trusted but an enemy multiplies kisses. And the idea there is that, you know, when someone is

435
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:49.779
authentic, they may tell you something that hurts, but you'd rather hear that and then be lovingly

436
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:59.479
truthful, then receive multiple kisses from an enemy who's only doing that just to gain an advantage

437
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:10.330
and then betray you. And so Proverbs speaks of this very thing. The Bible tells us that Judas ends

438
01:09:10.339 --> 01:09:21.148
up experiencing even greater damage because of his own rejection. In job 1919. It, it says this,

439
01:09:21.179 --> 01:09:29.878
that those I love have turned against me. And this verse is so powerful because it's exactly what

440
01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:36.949
happens in the life of Jesus. I mean, he loves Judas, but Judas does not love him back in the same

441
01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:46.330
way. And sometimes when we love people and we give ourselves to them and, and we want their kisses,

442
01:09:46.839 --> 01:09:54.149
they end up giving us their betrayal. Instead, they wound us and, and they hurt us and they discard

443
01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:04.979
us and they do whatever they need to do to have, they're full of us until they no longer do and they

444
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:16.120
reject us. The Bible tells us that Jesus was rejected this way by Judas. But instead of Jesus

445
01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:23.370
experiencing the rejection of Judas, it is Judas who experienced the greater damage of his own

446
01:10:23.379 --> 01:10:31.200
rejection. In fact, if you look at the two lives, Jesus, well, he's risen from the dead, but Judas

447
01:10:31.209 --> 01:10:40.700
instead takes his life and ends up dead. The one who was the betrayer is worse off than the one

448
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:47.379
who's betrayed. And that will always be the case by the way. And you need to be aware of that. And

449
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:54.830
that's why this story is so important so that we don't become the betrayers. We understand rejection

450
01:10:54.839 --> 01:11:04.169
and understand betrayal, but we never become the betrayers. We instead look at the life of Jesus and

451
01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:12.140
how he responded to betrayal. We see that he seeks after Peter. But in Judas case, he can't even go

452
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:19.029
after Judas because Judas has taken his life. So by the time Jesus is raised from the dead and in

453
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.080
the power of the resurrection, and he goes and seeks out all the disciples that rejected him and

454
01:11:25.089 --> 01:11:34.819
were hiding and were fearful and had abandoned him on the cross, all of them. But John, every other

455
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:44.640
one had rejected him. He cannot go after Judas to give him a second chance. But if he could have, he

456
01:11:44.649 --> 01:11:57.399
would have. And so we're all still alive. We're all still here able to put aside our betrayal, but

457
01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:07.109
also our intentions of betrayal. We can be here today and we can say God, I don't wanna be that

458
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.759
person. I don't wanna be like Peter and I don't wanna be like Judas. I don't wanna live my life this

459
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:21.220
way. I don't wanna be the person who has an outcome like this. And the Bible tells us that in

460
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:30.750
Matthew 23 verse uh 27 verse three, that when Judas who betrayed him realized that Jesus had been

461
01:12:30.759 --> 01:12:40.000
condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. And then he took the 30 pieces of silver back to the

462
01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:47.250
priests and the elders, the religious leaders and he threw them into the temple. He says, I don't

463
01:12:47.259 --> 01:12:56.479
want this anymore. But then in verse five, after he throws the silver coins in the temple, he goes

464
01:12:56.490 --> 01:13:06.410
out and he hangs himself. And here's the danger. We can be so overcome with betrayal and so overcome

465
01:13:06.419 --> 01:13:17.919
with being a betrayer that instead of living life, we lose it, we end it and we stop being the

466
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:30.089
person that God wants to be, be able to redeem because we think that we have rejected. It's so far

467
01:13:31.259 --> 01:13:39.709
and have been rejected so much by our actions that there is no way that we could ever return back to

468
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:46.330
a place where we would have a relationship with God again or with another person or have a better

469
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:52.979
outcome or have a different future. And so that's exactly what Satan wants to lie to you about today.

470
01:13:52.990 --> 01:14:01.220
He wants to make sure that you stop living. He wants you to just end your life and be known as a

471
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:08.669
betrayer, as someone who just keeps experiencing betrayal, as someone who just keeps living out

472
01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:16.870
rejection. Not someone who can be redeemed, not a life that can be restored, not someone who can

473
01:14:16.879 --> 01:14:27.069
have their future renewed, not someone who can rebuild and, and reignite their imagination to make

474
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:37.870
choices to create a future. Let God be the one who tells you right now that your life is not over.

475
01:14:38.819 --> 01:14:44.640
Let him be the one who reminds you that whatever has happened in the past is something that you can

476
01:14:44.649 --> 01:14:52.569
leave there once and for all. And have a new beginning. Leave, betrayal, leave being a betrayer,

477
01:14:52.930 --> 01:15:02.220
leave being rejected behind and embrace this new beginning that you're being offered today right now

478
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.439
through Jesus. Let me pray for you, father. Thank you for every person that is here today and for

479
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:15.020
the power of your word. And for the reminder of the things that we have heard today that may have

480
01:15:15.029 --> 01:15:23.310
spoken um directly to situations in our life. You've brought to memory things that maybe we've tried

481
01:15:23.319 --> 01:15:30.410
to forget and maybe things we just can never forget whatever the scenario might be. Lord, I pray

482
01:15:30.419 --> 01:15:35.979
that this moment would be a new beginning for every person here today that we can leave this

483
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:44.669
rejection behind and that we can rebuild a new life with you as we create this future together

484
01:15:44.859 --> 01:15:50.220
through the new choices that we make through the option that you are putting before us right now.

485
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:57.060
And that option is to no longer live according to the patterns of this world and to the things of

486
01:15:57.069 --> 01:16:03.729
this past. But instead to choose the new beginning that you are offering each of us right now. We

487
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:10.689
pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. God bless you have a great gathering as it continues.

488
01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:16.899
There's a song coming up right now and that song is gonna lead you um into a place of worship. And I

489
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:22.000
pray that this would be a meaningful moment between you and God and don't forget that we're gonna

490
01:16:22.009 --> 01:16:28.439
continue the series next week and we're gonna be talking about being rejected by God. And so I want

491
01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:35.250
you to know that I'll be back live next week. We'll see you then God bless you. Have a great Sunday

492
01:16:35.259 --> 01:16:36.089
and a great week

493
01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:49.839
I think we've all experienced rejection or betrayal in one form or the other. But the beauty of

494
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:56.709
knowing God is that we have this assurance that no matter what, we can always run back to Him. He's

495
01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:04.439
a place of safety and a place of um of hope. Um So as we sing this next song together, it's just um

496
01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:11.620
it's just us acknowledging how awesome our God is, how mighty, how holy, how wonderful and how

497
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:13.720
mindful of each one of us.

521
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:58.500
Wow, amazing. Thank you so much for being with us this morning. It's been a wonderful experience.
