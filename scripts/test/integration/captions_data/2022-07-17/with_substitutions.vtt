WEBVTT

1
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:07.240
Yeah, Excellent. Um, so thank you for being there for the welcome word of opening. Usually people

2
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.730
arrive a little bit later to make sure that they missed that part. So thank you for encouraging me

3
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.950
this morning. I really appreciate your presence this morning. Okay. Uh, this was obviously not in

4
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:26.650
the script. It was improvisation. Um, so really happy having you on that wonderful day of summer.

5
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:34.890
We're in our sixth week of Hors serie multiply this morning. We'll have the message from Pastor

6
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:44.840
Lorenzo named the empty jars. And this is really the story about Elijah and the widow and her son.

7
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:53.040
So it will be really an exciting message that will, will hear this morning together. So make sure to

8
00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:02.510
stay until that part. Also just one thing. Also, we're always talking about the opportunity that we

9
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:08.510
all have when you were coming here to belong to that community even before we believe. So no matter

10
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.900
where you are in your journey of faith, no matter what you believe in, you can belong to that

11
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:20.530
community, you can feel welcome and you can feel accepted no matter what your beliefs are, it's a

12
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:26.880
privilege to have you in that community. Also be sure that we totally understand that maybe

13
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.830
sometimes it's not the best week that has just happened and we're coming here maybe a little bit

14
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:40.800
drained maybe a little bit with some sadness in our heart may be joyful. So we're all in the same

15
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.890
boat. This is what life is about, is really having like these, these difficult and happy moments

16
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:53.220
that are all in the same week. So just for example, this week, unfortunately one of my colleague

17
00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:01.160
lost our sons and we were celebrating a marriage last Saturday. So I guess this is life and so so

18
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:09.190
happy moments and really some sadness and and sorrow that we we need to live in and that's that's

19
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.850
the lot of all of us. And that's the reason why also we have community and places like here where we

20
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:22.580
can really freely express what things are happening and make sure that we support each other. So

21
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:29.050
without further ado I will, I'll ask you to maybe would you stand this morning? Maybe it will be a

22
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:35.110
good thing to do. And by the way, if your by standing, it will be a good opportunity to maybe do

23
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:41.000
some stretching. Okay. Because there's a lot of place before people come back so you can stretch a

24
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.580
little bit like this like this perfect like this. Just to seek the violence. Okay. Just want to see

25
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:53.260
the balance if you're still okay. Yeah. Some people I'm hearing cracking. Okay, perfect. So it's

26
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.920
really bad. So I don't want people to hurt themselves. So thank you for standing. That's really,

27
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:06.860
really hot and, and and also the fact that you're not standing you little boy, what are you doing?

28
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:16.220
And you're probably the youngest in the place. Okay, So really let's join our hands together to

29
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.950
welcome our very own worship team of River's Edge with Yes, I can

30
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.450

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.590
now I can't deny

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:28.210
through every single time and from the

42
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.430

78
00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:08.970
You are the horizon, the bright glimmer that breaks the constant night. You are the brilliance, the

79
00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:18.440
dream, the evidence of things unseen. Because even though

You are the glory next days. You never dim. You never fail. You are the past. The true nothing can

83
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:07.160
stop you. Nothing can stop you

84
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.500
at the time

85
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.180

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.860

89
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.600

91
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:13.210

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.570

Mhm. That's right.

95
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:47.590
Thank you so much. You may be seated um real privilege to be with you this morning for the first

96
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:56.270
announcement. We want to let you know that Sunday July 31st. There will be a picnic in the park over

97
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:03.220
there. So it will be a picnic with all the community. You're all invited to be there. There will be

98
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:10.590
food and beverage that we will provide. But we ask you also for those of you can To bring also food

99
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.770
and beverages, uh, to make sure that there is plenty and enough for everyone. So please write this

100
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:25.650
in your agenda, picnic July 31 in the park just in front of the church. That will be a good time of

101
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:32.100
community and exchange. Also. We want to remind you that if you want to support that community,

102
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:38.570
there's four ways to give, we really appreciate and thank you for your generosity just by the way,

103
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:45.290
for the, not the last two months, but let's say like for a few weeks we've been able to meet our

104
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:52.220
budget a few weeks also, we aren't being able to meet our budget in terms of revenue that we are

105
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:59.130
seeking. But even in the summer we're slowly for some week meeting or targets. So it's really

106
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:05.900
encouraging. Usually summer season, it's a difficult situation in churches because of the attendance

107
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:11.470
that varies. But we're really appreciative of your generosity, the effort that you're doing to

108
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.350
support the community. Obviously, if you're a newcomer, someone that is there for the first time,

109
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.330
forget about that money announcement. It's really about people that decided to make that community

110
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:29.050
the place where they want to stay and they consider being partnered with us by supporting all our

111
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:34.670
vision, the project that we have in front of us financially. So we really, really want to thank you

112
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:40.160
for those of you are committed to that community. So these are the four ways that you can use to

113
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:48.230
give also in some kind of appetizer for the picnic, July 31. There is the after party which is

114
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:54.820
basically a practice of the picnic. Okay so you can drink and eat their each Sunday and prepare for

115
00:26:54.820 --> 00:27:03.370
the picnic in July 31. Obviously the next edition of the picnic will be in December, so it will be a

116
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:09.900
little bit colder. So make sure you enjoy the picnic of July 31st which will be a little bit hot uh

117
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:15.170
and then prepare for the next one. But seriously, the after party, make sure that you stay with us

118
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:21.320
at the end of the gathering and connect with all of us. We want to know you were interested in what

119
00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:28.320
is happening in your lives and it's always a good opportunity also to meet our pastor Lorenzo. So

120
00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:39.130
kids and youth you are dismissed. So it's the right moment to um go at check in booth to make sure

121
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:44.620
with your parents. It's always a good thing to let your parents know where you are. It's a trick in

122
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:51.460
life. It's always been helpful for me in my life when I wasn't doing that. My parents were a bit

123
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.560
like

124
00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:06.920
really generous this morning. Okay, seriously, um we're gonna continue that gathering with the

125
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:15.630
message series that we are. We have started six weeks ago, his name and multiplied with Pastor

126
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:21.460
Lorenzo, Please welcome him. Mhm. Thank you. Let's go.

127
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:23.860
Mhm.

128
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:43.880
Yeah, with us. It's so glad that we have this opportunity on this beautiful summer day to be able to

129
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.620
gather together in this place. You guys excited for what God has in store for you and what he wants

130
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:55.130
to offer you today. I just want to congratulate someone here this morning who really deserves it. Uh

131
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.980
Pablo passed his bar exam. He was already a lawyer in brazil, but now he's a lawyer in Quebec. So

132
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.050
congratulations Pablo.

133
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.940
It's amazing. How many more countries do you want to be a lawyer in now? That's the last one maybe?

134
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:18.050
Yeah. Okay, that's good. But we're glad that that happened. And congratulations and we're so glad to

135
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:23.940
be able to celebrate these moments with our community of faith. And we have had several people who

136
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:32.000
in this month have married just recently, I married someone this past Sunday claudia and uh and the

137
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.800
handy. Um and it was beautiful to do that with them um at this beautiful vineyard in Saint Hilaire

138
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.600
and congratulations to them and we're so glad that you are here today. And if there's any way that

139
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.160
we can help you at any point in your own spiritual journey, if there's anything that you need,

140
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.700
please see me afterwards at the after party. Well I want to read these scriptures to you in 2nd

141
00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:04.860
Kings chapter four vs 1-7. And these are beautiful verses that tell us a wonderful story of

142
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:11.780
multiplication in a time of incredible hardship and difficulty in this family's life. And there's

143
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.250
principles here that I know when when we apply them in our own life, no matter what the

144
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:22.150
circumstances. God is going to bring about multiplication for us as well. And so Lord, I just pray

145
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:27.390
that you open our hearts as we would read your word. That you would give us insights that would not

146
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:35.400
even be spoken by me, but spoken by you directly to each person that is listening. That you would be

147
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:42.500
able to give them a revelation of what they need most in their life today. And we ask this in Jesus

148
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:50.070
name. Amen. And so let's read this passage together. It's found in Second Kings chapter four. And

149
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:58.090
then verse one so one day the widow of a member of the group of prophets came to Elisha and she

150
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:06.790
cried out, She said, my husband who served you is dead. And you know how he feared the Lord. But now

151
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:16.340
a creditor has come and he's threatening to take my two sons as slaves as a repayment for the debt

152
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:27.190
that is owed. What can I do to help you? Alicia asked, tell me, he says, what do you have in the

153
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:40.170
house? And the widow responds with these words. Nothing at all except a flask of olive oil, she

154
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:52.360
replied. And then Elisha says, we'll borrow then as many empty jars as you can from your friends and

155
00:31:52.360 --> 00:32:02.860
neighbors. And then I want you to go into your house with your sons and I want you to shut the door

156
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:14.150
behind you and then I want you to pour the olive oil from your flask into the jars, setting each one

157
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:24.880
aside when it is filled. And so she did as she was told, and her sons kept bringing the jars to her

158
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:36.410
and she filled one after another, and then soon every container was full to the brim. Bring me

159
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:47.850
another jar, she said to one of her sons, There aren't any more, he told her. And then the olive oil

160
00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:55.120
stopped flowing. Now when she told the man of God what had happened, he said to her, now I want you

161
00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:05.390
to sell the olive oil and I want you to pay your debts so that you and your sons can live on what is

162
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:15.500
left over. And God bless the reading of his word to our hearts. Amen. It is such a powerful story of,

163
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:25.730
of God providing in the most dire of circumstances. Olive oil is seen as obviously a symbol of the

164
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:37.320
Holy Spirit. It's a symbol that was so clearly evidenced in various moments of when one was to be

165
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:48.560
ordained or anointed or commissioned or brought before people and identified as having the hand of

166
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:56.100
God upon their life and often when they would anoint someone with oil, it isn't a few drops that are

167
00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:06.040
spilled today, they would cover them entirely from head to toe, so that no part of them had been

168
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:16.330
untouched by the oil, and therefore no part of them remained untouched by God. And so oil was used

169
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:26.310
for everything, not just for cooking, not just for eating, but also for healing. It was something

170
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:33.520
that was so important and vital. And so when the widow describes that she has nothing left in her

171
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:42.490
house except for a flask of oil, two things are being communicated here. One is she sees herself

172
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:52.100
with nothing but God is able to use the something that she has overlooked. And it comes to her

173
00:34:52.100 --> 00:35:04.430
memory and her reminder of what God can do. When he asks, what do you have? You offer what it is.

174
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:13.280
You actually have not what you do not have, but what you do have. He asks her very simple question,

175
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:20.070
what is in your house? And the first word is nothing. But then she remembers, I have a little bit of

176
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:30.180
oil and that sets the stage for what God can do if she says nothing and continues to insist, it is

177
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.760
there is nothing that I believe. Nothing can be done.

178
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:44.890
But the moment you search your heart and you search your house and you truly reflect on what it is

179
00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:53.640
you do have. You will find something that you will be able to offer God. So that in the moment of

180
00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:00.840
your greatest need, he can take whatever that is and then multiply it. But if you continue to

181
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:08.740
believe there is nothing, then you will receive nothing. You will experience nothing. Multiplication

182
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:17.410
cannot happen. If you have nothing but what you do have and you give that over to God, then God can

183
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:25.870
and will do something. So right now, when you look at your life and you say I have nothing, then

184
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:34.410
obviously God cannot produce in you or through you or even for you, the multiplication that he

185
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:44.290
desires. So when the widow makes her way over to Elisha and asks him, what am I to do? Because I am

186
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:52.920
in peril, I'm in danger. She knows that it's not just about her sons being taken as slaves, but it's

187
00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:00.290
about her own life falling into slavery as well. And in those times you could only hold a slave for

188
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:07.230
seven years maximum, or until the debt was paid. And so it would be determined how long you would be

189
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:12.970
able to work off a debt kind of like today when you don't pay your parking tickets and you end up in

190
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:20.880
jail, right? It's never happened to me by the way, but I know about this, but you can sometimes not

191
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:28.060
have the money. And so you say, well, I'll go to jail and pay this off to do it this way that if

192
00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:35.450
you're stuck and that's all you have, then that's what you'll do. It's not any different in that day

193
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.630
when someone would say, you owe me a debt, Well, I'll put you to work but I won't pay you. I will

194
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:48.280
feed you. But you will be a slave in my house until the debt is paid. But if this happens to our

195
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.950
sons and the sons are not working for the household, what do you think is gonna happen to the mom?

196
00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:04.400
Most likely she will die. And so this is really a perilous situation. And interestingly enough, this

197
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:12.670
is happening to someone whose husband was a servant of the Lord. Someone who had dedicated his life

198
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:20.720
to serving God and honoring him. Someone who God could have healed and avoided this situation from

199
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:26.390
the start. Someone that God could have even maybe raised from the dead and given the husband back to

200
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:34.480
this family, someone whom God could have done any number of things to not allow for this family who

201
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:40.390
was part of a council of prophets who were going about preaching and announcing the word of God to

202
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:49.140
whatever village and town and city was in their area. That somehow no one else came to their aid.

203
00:38:53.420 --> 00:39:00.050
No one came running to say, Dear woman, what is it that you need for you and your family since your

204
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:08.940
husband has died? No one brought anything to their door. No one helped them with their debt.

205
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.060
And sometimes that happens

206
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.740
sometimes the people we expect to be there, part

207
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:29.020
the people we imagine are going to support us and help us and encourage us and be there for us in

208
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:36.290
our spiritual journey just aren't there. They're not just not meeting our spiritual needs. But

209
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:40.240
sometimes when we have physical needs, they're nowhere to be found

210
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:48.230
when we can't pay our rent and we have no groceries in the fridge and when we don't know where our

211
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:56.150
next meal and paycheck is going to come from that, there isn't anyone who comes and offers help.

212
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:07.850
This woman does the only thing she can do if she goes to the leader of the prophets Alecia who

213
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:14.430
performed more miracles than any other prophet in the scriptures, by the way, the only person who

214
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.640
performs more miracles than Elisha in the Bible is Jesus.

215
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:27.880
And what's interesting about this story is that Elisha doesn't say, I'm gonna come to your house and

216
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.440
performed a miracle, but she equips the woman to perform the miracle herself.

217
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:41.830
I want you to pay attention to that because that is so key because Elijah gives her the principles

218
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.020
that unlocks the miracle

219
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:54.330
in which allows for her life and the life of her sons to be changed forever. Can we say Amen to that.

220
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:06.770
And that's how, you know, Elisha is not in it for the glory. That's how, you know, it isn't about

221
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:13.430
him, his name, his ministry and about what he can do and how God can do it through him and how it

222
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:19.280
won't happen unless he's there and how important he is for everything to happen, that God wants to

223
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:25.070
happen because he's got to be there to put his hands on the situation because he's got to step into

224
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.720
the house because he's got to close that door because he's got to be the one who takes the small

225
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.700
flask of oil and he has to be the one who pours it out. He doesn't do any of that, he tells the

226
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.480
woman what to do. And I want you to understand that that's what Jesus has done for us. He's gonna

227
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.370
feel like he hasn't given us anything, it's gonna feel like he hasn't come with us. It's gonna feel

228
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:49.270
like he isn't in the room, it's gonna feel like we're on our own. But I need you to understand that

229
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:56.750
what Jesus does is that he teaches us how to make multiplication happen. And if you will take these

230
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.370
principles and put them into practice, then you will see it too. And then you're not standing on

231
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:07.380
your words or the words of a prophet or the words of a leader or a pastor or anyone else that you

232
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:13.630
would consider to be a spiritual guide in your life. You are standing on the authority that has been

233
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:21.530
passed down for thousands of years and generations and it's no longer about you saying what needs to

234
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:25.610
happen, but it's about reminding God what he has said would happen,

235
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:36.490
not defiantly not with pride or anger. Not with a spirit of condemnation even towards God or an

236
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:43.710
attitude of judgment, but simply reminding him in faith. God if you did it for the widow you can do

237
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.320
it for me.

238
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.610
If Alicia gave these principles to her and she saw this miracle, then I know that I can see it too

239
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:02.010
and you can stand on that that is your foundation. That is your ability to go before God and stand

240
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.520
on his promise that what he did, he can do it again.

241
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:17.230
Now today we are talking about the prophets widow and the profits widow is about a woman in debt.

242
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:24.280
And I don't know if you see yourself as a person whose life is overflowing to the brim. But before

243
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.220
you I'm going to be transparent and say that is not me.

244
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:39.450
I know that I have room in my life to experience multiplication. How about you? Do you have room is

245
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:46.920
your jar full and overflowing or is there room for God to do something more? Because the other way

246
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:54.310
that God reminds us that we can still experience multiplication is if we believe that we are still

247
00:43:54.310 --> 00:44:00.590
in need of multiplication, that is not gonna do anything for you. If you think your jar is full,

248
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.630
I've got everything that I need. Thank you God, I'm so blessed and you are and it's great to be

249
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:13.150
grateful. It's wonderful to see you look at your life in wonder and be thankful for all that God has

250
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:22.570
done. But you can also believe in multiplication at the same time. You can also believe that God is

251
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:28.600
ready to do something more. Can I hear an amen? Are you guys with me? Are you summer sleeping? Are

252
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:34.720
you awake? I know it's a bit hot in here, but I want you to get hot with the fire of the Holy Spirit.

253
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:45.630
I want you to be old, alive and awake for what he wants to do next because it's coming. You see, he

254
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:51.820
asks them to do something very important, says I want you to go to your friends and then he says, I

255
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:59.270
want you to go to your neighbors and I want you to get and gather all of the empty jars. Now why is

256
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:06.220
this important? It's important because the misery that might be in this town isn't just hers.

257
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:12.310
She has friends who are in need and neighbors as well.

258
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.030
But she's the only one who went to the prophet and asked for God's word and then God gave her the

259
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:24.780
principles in how to experience multiplication. Are you guys still awake? You good? You hear what's

260
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:33.410
happening? If you don't go and see, you cannot find, if you do not knock, it will not be opened.

261
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:43.300
So it is impossible for you to receive what it is that God is sowing. If you don't take it and put

262
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:50.600
it into the ground so that you can then one day reap that harvest. So what he's reminding us is that

263
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:57.180
there are empty jars all over the place. Everybody is in need one way or another. But not everybody

264
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:04.480
is seeking the counsel of God to be able to experience multiplication. But if you are, I promise you

265
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.410
your jars will not be empty. I promise you that those of your friends and neighbors won't be either.

266
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.430
And in fact, if they're not gonna want them filled, I want you to go and get them and bring them to

267
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:21.220
your house because I will fill them there if they don't want it, I'm gonna give it to you. The

268
00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:31.700
parable of the talent is if you take the talent and you bury it, it means that you are hiding. It

269
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:39.840
means that you have hidden what should have been multiplied. It's like having a house full of empty

270
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:47.300
jars. You look at those empty jars and you say they serve a purpose. They're jars of clay that can

271
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.960
one day be filled. They're not filled right now, but they can be filled. God looks at those empty

272
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.800
jars and says something else. He says, why are they not filled?

273
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:07.620
You look at it and say they will be when the economy recovers, they will be when interest rates fall,

274
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:15.710
they will when I get a higher paying job, they will, when I finally able to step into my future.

275
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.150
They will when I finally have my goals realized and God is saying, why are you waiting for all of

276
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:27.930
those things. Those are just empty jars. Bring them to me and I will fill them now. Why are you

277
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:35.090
waiting for something else to happen on the exterior When I'm ready to do it inside your own house,

278
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:41.630
while you're waiting for things to change in the world. When I can do it in the room, when I ask you

279
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.490
to come behind it and close the door,

280
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:52.500
the image that we see next is one of the woman pouring the oil

281
00:47:55.490 --> 00:48:06.260
and the one who is acting and responding to the miracle that God has put before her is the woman

282
00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:14.440
herself. The flask of oil belongs to her. And so it's important that she holds it. It's important

283
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:21.950
that she pours it and with every pore and with every jar that is filled, you can see that she is

284
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:30.500
just growing in our face. And we know that because she keeps asking her sons bring me another jar.

285
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:38.550
You see what happens when you begin to experience multiplication Is that you no longer except an

286
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:51.080
empty jar. You no longer are okay with an empty jar. You are no longer okay with it being empty? You

287
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:57.000
don't accept that anymore. You look at that empty jar and you say, why is that not felt

288
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.580
when I have a God of multiplication?

289
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.700
Why is it not felt?

290
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.590
You see you bring an empty jar to God.

291
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:21.200
And God is saying my purpose is to fill it

292
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:33.750
and I will fill it with the little you have and the little you have, I will multiply it so that no

293
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.770
jar remains.

294
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:50.530
And so God gives us in this story. Through the words of the Prophet Elisha, the principles of

295
00:49:50.530 --> 00:50:02.280
multiplication. And here's the first one, gather more for the miracle pour. The first instructions

296
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:12.060
that were given where he had to gather more. Now they had a few jars in their home obviously. But

297
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:19.160
because God is a God of multiplication, he's saying it is not enough for you to just go with what

298
00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:26.370
you have. You need to go out and you need to get more that you can interpret that any way you like

299
00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:31.330
in terms of what the more is, it could be more people. It could be more in terms of resources, it

300
00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:38.420
could be exactly that empty jars, empty jars of your goals and your aspirations and the vision that

301
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:44.070
you have and and the things that you want to accomplish in this life that align with the God given

302
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:49.380
life and purpose and calling that he has already put on your. But I want you to understand that

303
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:59.570
unless you go out and make room for more, you will never experience multiplication because God needs

304
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:08.080
vessels in which to pour into and the more vessels you have then the further the multiplication can

305
00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:16.740
go and so you've got to gather more for the miracle poor were clear principle number one, ready for

306
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:23.100
number two, man, you guys are like sleeping on me man. I'm like bringing my best here and you guys

307
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.630
are not responding. I know there isn't a lot of people here today, so it sounds like a you know,

308
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:34.580
crickets, but there's enough people here for us to shadow a little bit in the house of God. Right,

309
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.580
okay, alright, sorry, I need to be encouraged to man,

310
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:47.680
Thank you. The second thing is you gotta gather your core and you gotta shut the door.

311
00:51:50.560 --> 00:52:00.610
Now the prophet says, I want you to take your sons and I want you to go in your house and I want you

312
00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:04.500
to shut that door. And and this is what a lot of us don't understand. When it comes to

313
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:09.070
multiplication. Multiplication means you have to have your core with you,

314
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:18.440
whoever that is, I don't know who you're right or die. Friend is in your life, but you need that guy,

315
00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:24.890
you need that girl, you need that person to be with you when you shut the door there in the house

316
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:34.120
believing in the multiplication with you. So that there is no doubt in that house, there was a time

317
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:41.570
when Jesus showed up at a house and everybody was morning and there were tens if not hundreds of

318
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:49.870
people crying because a girl had died. And what Jesus does is that when he shows up at that house,

319
00:52:49.880 --> 00:53:01.150
the first thing he does is that he kicks everybody out because there is no place for death when you

320
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:02.570
were about to bring life,

321
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:14.680
there is no place for people who are still weeping when they should be cheering.

322
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:27.140
And so in that moment, Jesus kicks everybody out and then he brings the girl back to life. And the

323
00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:40.740
principle of not having doubters with you, not having people who will divide you is so key. That

324
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:48.000
many times. We don't realize the reason why we are not experiencing multiplication is because we've

325
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:57.290
got the wrong people with us in the house when we shut the door and one of you is believing in the

326
00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:02.050
multiplication and the other is just bringing more division.

327
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:11.870
And so the second principle is you've got to bring people who will believe the same thing and you

328
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:20.320
will shut that door and not let anybody in. Sometimes the core isn't the person you do life with

329
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:25.690
because they are just bringing division in that moment. They don't have life, they have death in

330
00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:32.020
that moment, they are weeping, they are mourning, they are grieving, they have no celebration in

331
00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:39.690
them. They have no ability to bring faith and a belief that this which is dead can be brought back

332
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:42.060
to life, so they cannot be in the house with you

333
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:50.430
and I've seen people struggle over this over and over and over again. And I've had sometimes

334
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:57.170
arguments in my own household just to keep a positive mindset and keep a positive outlook and to

335
00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:04.150
have a focused moment together. Times, I've brought the negativity, times I about the doubt times I

336
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:10.520
brought the discouragement times, I about what was wrong times my wife did that, but we had to just

337
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:16.420
get focused again, Get on the same page to say enough of this, enough of the fighting in the victory,

338
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:23.150
Enough of the arguing, enough of believing the lie, believing there's no other way. Enough believing

339
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.430
that what has come in the mail or has been written in the email, no matter what the phone call was,

340
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:35.260
no matter what people have pronounced. None of that matters until God says something is final.

341
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:45.390
And when he says it's final, then it's final. Until then I will gather my core and I will shut the

342
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:56.910
door, gather your core and shut the door. You let no one and nothing in. And you stand true to what

343
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:04.660
God has said. That's it. Here's the 3rd principle. The third principle is that you have to gather

344
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:13.310
and poor only what you have to offer. God is not looking for you to offer anything other than what

345
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:18.450
you've got. You're gonna look at it and call it nothing. But God looks at it and says that is

346
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:27.810
something Your nothing is always something. Your belief that it's nothing God is telling you this is

347
00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:35.050
more than enough for it to be something. There is nothing that you can pronounce

348
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:43.960
that can hold you back from the multiplication that God has in store for you.

349
00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:54.940
If you are ready to make the decision to repent of that be reconciled with his truth again be

350
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.350
restored so that you can experience multiplication.

351
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:05.960
Her first words are nothing and then she remembers she has something

352
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:16.790
and I believe that when we turn back to God, God says now you're ready now I can reconcile you now

353
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:28.070
I can restore you now I can multiply. Hey I don't know what it is that we've been keeping God out of.

354
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:35.140
I don't know what it is that you specifically have just been saying over and over to God. It's

355
00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:42.040
nothing I have nothing, there's nothing but right now I'm going to pray that the holy bridges

356
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:49.040
reveals that right now just so that you can get past this moment of nothing and offer him something

357
00:57:50.630 --> 00:58:01.130
and as you offer Him something, watch God multiply it because as you gather and pour what you have

358
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:08.220
to offer then that's all that God is looking for. That's why the miracle and the miracle and the

359
00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:15.650
multiplication of the loaves and the fish was so powerful because it was just what they had and

360
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:21.470
Jesus wanted to show them early in his ministry what it looks like when you bring a little bit to

361
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:32.380
him that he can keep taking those lobes, he can keep blessing them, breaking them and then he gave

362
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:38.670
them to his disciples to distribute them. And it was when the bread was in the hands of his

363
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:42.040
disciples that it was multiplied.

364
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:52.970
You see Elijah did the same thing, blessed it, he broke it and then he gave it to the widow then she

365
00:58:52.970 --> 00:59:01.080
went home with it and she shut the door and she began to pour it out. Not what you didn't have, the

366
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:10.590
little bit that she had. And the Bible says that every jar was then filled to the brim, every single

367
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:20.900
one. And then the last thing that happens is this the oil only stops when there are no more jars to

368
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.250
fill.

369
00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.040
And so if you ever get to that place in your life where you're just full, guess what? Well the oil

370
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:35.420
is going to stop. People say, I don't have the strength to resist this problem pastor, I've always

371
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:42.200
struggled in this particular area and I say, is it possible that this is a jar that you just believe

372
00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:44.540
is just always going to be empty?

373
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:54.430
Because I think the answer to that is yes. But if you let God fill that drawer with his oil, here's

374
00:59:54.430 --> 01:00:01.780
what's going to happen. That jar has a new purpose now and it isn't for the garbage you used to

375
01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.330
receive,

376
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:11.000
it's for his presence that wants to overflow in your life and give you the victory over that which

377
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.340
was holding you back. And so if we understand this, then we understand how, how God multiplies He

378
01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:25.300
multiplies when we present ourselves as a continual empty jar. An earthen vessel made of clay,

379
01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:34.330
fragile, forged in fire, purposeful but still delicate enough to be broken.

380
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:48.120
But God can still fill us to the brim with his presence with an oil that will keep pouring out as

381
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:55.780
long as we keep presenting ourselves as an empty vessel and any other empty vessel you have. You

382
01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:04.900
bring it, you bring it and see how God brings about that multiplication in your life. Alright, I'm

383
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:13.480
done. You guys are good. Thank you so much. I hope these principles encourage you. They're not mine.

384
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:19.540
They're the Lord's, they're not mine. They're his. We give him all the glory today. And we want to

385
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:26.320
make sure that we are people who experience multiplication the way that God wants us to, I want you

386
01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.470
to experience multiplication. I want you to be blessed by God. I want you to live your best life

387
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:40.380
according to how God has already established it. And I don't want the enemy to have any power or

388
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:46.490
influence over You don't want to have any victory over you in any area of your life. And so as we

389
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:53.840
come before him right now in prayer, let's ask him to fill us with his oil. Very simple prayer. But

390
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.080
as we do that, I know that we can begin to experience multiplication. And so father, I pray that

391
01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:07.360
every person here is an empty vessel as an earthen jar that you would fill us once again with your

392
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.990
presence with your spirit made overflow. And may we identify our core so we can shut that door and

393
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:20.170
experience the multiplication that you have in store for each of us. Lord. You know what each of us

394
01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:26.210
needs. You know what each person here desires. You see what aligns and what will lead us further

395
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:32.290
from you instead of directly in your presence. And so I pray Lord that you would give us that

396
01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:37.730
understanding and that discernment to experience the victory that you have in store for us. Thank

397
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:44.060
you for today for your words for your teaching and for the way that it helps us and inspires us to

398
01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:51.020
take the next steps in Jesus name. We pray Amen. Would you just stand with me as you would sing this

399
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:56.830
song? Amazing. Love. It's the last song we're gonna sing today and then uh johan is gonna come up

400
01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.610
and close this out and if you're here and I haven't talked to yet, I haven't met you. I would love

401
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:06.480
to do that. So please just take a moment and meet me at the after cafe and we'll chat and get to

402
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.930
know one another and I'm so glad to do that with you today. And so can we just welcome the River's

You might die for me.

It's true.

412
01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.130
It's my joy.

413
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.000
Let's see that again.

414

And I'm accepted. You were down

422
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.300

Let me

Thanks God. Yeah.

430
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.280
Mm

431
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:10.600
wow. Was it a wonderful Sunday. Can we just applaud the Lord our worship team and our pastor as well.

432
01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:17.960
Really thank you for being with us and those also that were there at home where it's been a

433
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:24.970
privilege to have you this morning. Um, so and really encouraging message and really let us ask God,

434
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:31.270
what are our talent? What are the elements that you want to multiply in our life? Don't forget there

435
01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:37.850
is the after priority which will be a great preparation for a picnic on July 31. Good opportunity to

436
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:45.890
have discussion and eat a little something before the lunch. Also the don't forget about the

437
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:51.220
different ways to give. Don't hesitate if you want to support that community. Your gift are really

438
01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:57.100
more than welcome. Thank you also for everything that you're doing either financially or with the

439
01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:02.960
time that you're giving to that community. Don't forget also that you can stay linked to us and

440
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.360
connected to us through the weeks by using the website. So that's really the best way to communicate

441
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:14.590
with that and be aware of what are the different activities. And the last thing that we want to say

442
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:20.430
to you this morning is really thank you for being with us and also see you next Sunday. Have a

443
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:21.980
wonderful Sunday. Bye bye.
