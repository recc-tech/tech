00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:16.700
starting a new series today with Pastor Lorenzo called Let there Be Joy and it's very fitting

8
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:24.140
because we're now in the Christmas season. Um And please look at our decor. Some of it's held up

9
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:30.979
with a prayer, but we thank everybody that helped us get ready for the season this year. So let's

10
00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:37.830

11
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.409
us.

12
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.020
The first song we're singing is called now and forever. And I just want these words to speak to you,

13
00:09:47.549 --> 00:09:54.479
think of these words and just let it minister to you. We are all here together to support each other.

14
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.809
Praise God

39
00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:04.900
the way you move within us. I

40
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:31.330
and to believe in the miracles that God can do and the miracle of jesus' birth in the season. Let's

41
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:37.549
think about the miracle that He is to us and for all the things that He can do in our lives, we

42
00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.900
praise our holy and awesome God.

43
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.820
The one who made the blindness.

69
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:27.670
I will bring in. You're the God of miracle.

70
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.229
Praise God. Thank you.

71
00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:58.640
We're going to talk about the trust of God. He we worship. We love you. You are with us all the time.

72
00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:03.329
Bless it. A sure rain.

73
00:22:05.609 --> 00:22:06.719
Jesus dear.

97
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:07.229
I sought the Lord. I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered, I sought the Lord and he heard

98
00:25:07.869 --> 00:25:09.170
the answer

99
00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:21.420
and he heard and he answered. That's why I trust him. That's why I trust I sought the Lord and he

100
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.050
heard and he answered, I sought the Lord. And

101
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.650
so,

121
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.449
And

122
00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:47.250
thank you very much for our savior. He never fails us. Praise God

123
00:28:57.619 --> 00:29:06.359
me every time. Do you know that you can trust the Lord? Yeah, I feel like I'm interrupting worship

124
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:16.219
today. We, we do have a few announcements. The first is today is the last day that we're going to be

125
00:29:16.229 --> 00:29:22.800
asking for help in this way. But it's also a praise report because our children's ministry is

126
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:29.819
growing, it's growing, we're getting more kids and we're able now to split the classes into three.

127
00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:34.425
So we have a nursery class, we have a kindergarten to grade four and we're gonna be having a grade

128
00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:40.935
five and six. So what that means is we still need a couple of teachers to help us out. It's not

129
00:29:40.944 --> 00:29:48.324
often it's once a month or once every two months, but we need your help and we're asking so, Talita

130
00:29:48.334 --> 00:29:54.699
would be very, very grateful if you would give her a hand in the, in the children's ministry. Uh

131
00:29:54.709 --> 00:30:01.560
Secondly, we have a young adult movie night, but we're gonna rebrand this. So I've been talking to

132
00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:10.719
the organizers. It's actually college and careers. So we're expecting people between 20 about 35

133
00:30:10.729 --> 00:30:17.344
years old. So young adults moving into old, the adults to come out for the movie night this

134
00:30:17.354 --> 00:30:25.645
Wednesday and it's home alone, the original home alone. It's almost retro at this point at 7 p.m. So

135
00:30:25.805 --> 00:30:32.135
20 year olds, 35 year olds come on out join us. I might sneak in because I'm determined to stay in

136
00:30:32.145 --> 00:30:37.854
my thirties forever. Um There'll be popcorn, there'll be hot chocolate. It's gonna be a really nice

137
00:30:37.864 --> 00:30:46.569
time together. So we invite you out Wednesday, December 6th at 7 p.m. on Saturday, December 9th,

138
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:55.310
Yvonne Maa who was a former pastor here. She is a counselor by trade is hosting a course here at

139
00:30:55.319 --> 00:31:02.430
River's Edge at 9:30 a.m. So this is next Saturday and it's called cultivate, repositioning your

140
00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:09.089
heart for the season. And what I can tell you about this is you will be blessed. The season can be

141
00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:14.319
hard sometimes. And it's not just about the holiday season that we're going into, but whatever the

142
00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:20.790
season that God has for you next. So it's positioning yourself uh emotionally, psychologically, and

143
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.734
most importantly, spiritually, to be able to step into that season and what God has for you, I

144
00:31:26.744 --> 00:31:33.035
promise you, she is a wealth of information. You will not leave without being changed. So that's

145
00:31:33.045 --> 00:31:41.650
next Saturday at 9:30 a.m. there'll also be food and drinks um provided and a workbook. And finally,

146
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:47.790
we just wanna thank you for your donations and your tithes and what you've been giving to our

147
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.770
community that allows us to do what we do within these walls, in our community and within Montreal.

148
00:31:54.339 --> 00:32:00.469
And uh we just ask that you give whatever you are comfortable with whatever God puts on your heart

149
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:07.099
and know that that will be blessed. God will honor your generosity. God is about generosity and this

150
00:32:07.109 --> 00:32:12.670
is a, a season to remember that. And so we thank you in advance and for whatever you will be giving

151
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:18.459
in the future, whether it's monetary or your time. So let's prepare our hearts. Now, past Lorenzo is

152
00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:21.900
coming out and we're gonna start our new series. Let there be Joy.

153
00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:25.300
So we're in this new series called Let there Be Joy. And we're so glad that you could be a part of

154
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:30.020
this. Um You know, people said, hey, why don't you just continue with the rejected series because

155
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:36.000
it's so good. And I said, we can always come back to rejection because we keep experiencing it. But

156
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:42.300
I feel like we need to be like theme appropriate and just kind of make a shift here and uh and enter

157
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:50.780
into this season that we're in which I think can sometimes be so easily confused with the things

158
00:33:50.790 --> 00:34:01.430
that we feel are lacking, missing things that are disappointing and frustrating. And when we don't

159
00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:08.110
experience those things, it can really affect our joy. I think one of the first things we need to do

160
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:18.030
is just make an important distinction between what is the difference between happy being happy,

161
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:24.570
experiencing happiness and, and what is the difference between that and, and joy? Well,

162
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:31.550
interestingly enough, we know that happy is an emotion just like joy is and in the English language,

163
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:39.849
we kind of use these two interchangeably. But I need us to understand that happiness is more of an

164
00:34:39.858 --> 00:34:47.688
emotion like sadness or jealousy. It's something that can appear and then disappear. It is something

165
00:34:47.698 --> 00:34:54.099
that is fleeting. It is not something that always remains just like you're not always jealous, but

166
00:34:54.108 --> 00:35:00.688
you have experienced moments of jealousy just like you're not always sad, but you experience moments

167
00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:08.860
of sadness just like you can experience happiness and not always be happy. You might be happy about

168
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:16.169
something and then something comes along to take away that happiness and you expect it because you

169
00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:26.260
know that you cannot be continually happy, forever, happiness doesn't last. Happiness is great and

170
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:32.139
we get happiness from a lot of things and, and that's why the scriptures talk about happiness this

171
00:35:32.149 --> 00:35:38.300
way. And I need us to turn to the scriptures for our wisdom. And, and in Romans chapter 14 and in

172
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:45.189
verse 17, this is what it says. It says that the Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and

173
00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:54.909
drinking, but it's one of righteousness, peace and then it clarifies it and says it is joy in the

174
00:35:54.919 --> 00:36:06.149
Holy Spirit. You see, in this one verse, we have the explanation of happiness, enjoy. In this one

175
00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:13.270
verse, God reveals what each one is. He says, the Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and

176
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.750
drinking. And, and we're entering into a season of, of eating and drinking. Maybe we never leave

177
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:24.520
that season, right? I don't know, we're always in it. We just, we just find another excuse for it,

178
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:31.530
right? But, but in the scriptures, there's someone who says that he works his whole life

179
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:38.034
accumulating wealth and, and, and when he gets to the point of of retirement, he he makes one last

180
00:36:38.044 --> 00:36:43.235
move and he takes his, his old barns and he tears them down and he builds bigger barns and he fills

181
00:36:43.245 --> 00:36:48.834
them to the brim. And then he looks at what he's put aside and then he says, now I'm gonna spend the

182
00:36:48.844 --> 00:36:58.449
rest of my days eating and drinking and being married and he makes his plans for the future. And the

183
00:36:58.459 --> 00:37:04.129
Bible says that that night, he, he, he, he gained the whole world, but he actually loses his soul.

184
00:37:05.979 --> 00:37:12.229
And so we understand that sometimes happiness can be just like that. You know, it's like making a

185
00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:18.550
decision to, to enter into retirement. My dad was so looking forward to his retirement and, and he

186
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.350
died at the age of 64

187
00:37:23.389 --> 00:37:30.010
he was so excited about the fact that he was just one year away and he never got to experience it

188
00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:38.520
that sometimes we make plans for our happiness and, and we never step into it. And so we have to

189
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:45.399
understand that that life has a way of, of, of not being fair with us. Uh The things happen that,

190
00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:50.979
that, that take away our happiness. But, but more importantly, we, we have to understand that

191
00:37:50.989 --> 00:37:58.070
there's something that God can do for us that no one can ever take away. And that's he wants to give

192
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:04.000
us a different kind of experience and that is one of joy.

193
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:19.219
So that's why he says this. He says that the joy is not dependent on the things of this earth, but

194
00:38:19.229 --> 00:38:28.330
it's dependent on our connection to the Holy Spirit, says our connection to the Holy Spirit to God

195
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:39.350
himself reveals if we are truly experiencing joy, are always in the temporal emotion of happiness.

196
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:48.100
And so I look at my life and I say God, am I a person who just keeps experiencing happiness and

197
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:56.969
pursuing happiness or my person instead who is pursuing your joy? Am I a person who keeps

198
00:38:56.979 --> 00:39:05.260
experiencing happiness or am I a person who is experiencing joy? And I never asked myself this

199
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:11.149
question before because I just thought they were always the same thing. Anybody else? I just thought

200
00:39:11.159 --> 00:39:14.830
they were one and the same. I didn't think they were different and I didn't know that we could

201
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:23.479
experience them differently. But that's exactly what he's saying. And he is saying that this is how

202
00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:33.129
it happens in the book of Hebrews chapter 12. And in verse two, it tells us this. If you fix your

203
00:39:33.139 --> 00:39:43.409
eyes on Jesus, then what you're going to have is you're going to have the stability that you need to

204
00:39:43.419 --> 00:39:48.820
move out of a place of happiness and into a dimension of joy

205
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:57.040
out of what is temporal into something that is never ending

206
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:06.760
because he is the pioneer and he is the perfecter of faith. And for the joy, then he says, said

207
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:15.209
before him, look at this, for the joy set before him, he endured the cross

208
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.760
and I always said to myself, you know, what is it that Jesus had to do to endure the cross? And the

209
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.429
Bible says that he endured it because of joy.

210
00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:34.879
He made it through the most torturous moment that a human being can face

211
00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:47.310
because it wasn't based on the circumstances, it was based on his relationship with the father, a

212
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:56.149
union that could not be severed. And that's why he experienced joy instead. And he faced everything

213
00:40:57.719 --> 00:41:08.439
with joy. And then look what happens. He sits down at the right hand at the throne of God. And what

214
00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:15.729
that means is that there is so much more joy ahead for us. It means that because Jesus is at the

215
00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:26.040
right hand, it means that the joy that he depended on to get him through. Everything is the same joy

216
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:33.820
that he is dispensing today. It's the same joy that you need to make it through whatever it is that

217
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:42.800
you are living and facing in your life and may face in the future days to come. Because He is at the

218
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:51.860
right hand of God. He isn't just offering you happiness. He is offering you joy. And so now we

219
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:58.340
understand this a little better. We understand the difference between the two, how the scriptures

220
00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:05.959
reveal it, how it explains it and how it can be lived out in our daily lives. And now we enter into

221
00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:14.250
the story for today. The story for today is found in Luke chapter one. And it's verse 11 that we're

222
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:22.629
gonna look at and it says that the angel of the Lord appears to Zachariah and look where he is.

223
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:33.620
He is standing at the right side of the altar of incense. And, and that was the place where, where

224
00:42:33.629 --> 00:42:41.889
prayers were offered up. It was where service was conducted, where he would need to pray where he

225
00:42:41.899 --> 00:42:50.040
needed to be so that he could be an intercessor on behalf of his people. He stood in that position

226
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:57.929
as a priest, but he was no prophet and he certainly was no king. He was there interceding for the

227
00:42:57.939 --> 00:43:03.510
people. But there was something that he couldn't do and that was he couldn't dispense joy

228
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:12.040
unlike Jesus who is at the right hand of the father and does exactly that he dispenses joy. But

229
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:17.959
Zechariah, he's in a place where he doesn't even have joy in his own life. We know this because in

230
00:43:17.969 --> 00:43:26.919
verse 12, it says that when Zechariah saw the angel, he was startled and he was gripped with fear.

231
00:43:26.929 --> 00:43:34.080
And anytime you see this in the scriptures, it's whenever you see a sinful person standing before

232
00:43:34.149 --> 00:43:40.570
the holiness of God, it is then that you were startled, it is then that you were overcome and

233
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.709
overwhelmed with fear. And I, and I, and I'll be honest with you just like, I hope you're gonna be

234
00:43:45.719 --> 00:43:53.530
honest with yourself. II, I feel like we are, we are happiness seekers because that's all we think

235
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.379
life is

236
00:43:57.899 --> 00:44:07.439
we avoid a deeper relationship with God. Because when we do, we feel startled and we feel fearful

237
00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:16.260
because the closer you get to God, uh, the more our comfort level is impacted

238
00:44:19.229 --> 00:44:29.250
and instead of wanting more of that and moving towards joy, we retreat and we stay in our place,

239
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.500
seeking happiness.

240
00:44:33.449 --> 00:44:42.139
And we turn to the places of eating and drinking places that help in our forgetting. We turn to the

241
00:44:42.149 --> 00:44:51.290
things that help with our dealing, but they never lead to transformation. Does that make sense? You

242
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:57.070
see, this is what happens instinctively and, and Zachariah is in the temple, he's prepared an entire

243
00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:04.320
year for this moment. And then when God shows up, he, he just wants that moment to be done. He's

244
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.929
like, I'm not ready for this. I'm not, this is not what I signed up for. This is not what I want.

245
00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:16.679
This is not the moment that I've been looking for and, and sometimes God, you know, rewards us with

246
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:20.120
his presence instead of presence.

247
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:32.239
See, I go into the presence of God wanting presence. Anybody else, I always want presents. I love

248
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:38.679
presents. I, I don't like buying my own presents but I, but, but sometimes I'm OK with that too.

249
00:45:38.689 --> 00:45:44.830
Anybody else wrap their own presents. Sometimes for Christmas like you buy exactly what you want and

250
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.860
then you wrap it and then you put it under a tree and then on Christmas day you're just like opening

251
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:55.639
the present and you just buy yourself anybody ever done that? Ok. That's just my Christmas

252
00:45:55.649 --> 00:46:02.669
experience. Then I, I love doing that because I know exactly what I want. Right. I know exactly what

253
00:46:02.679 --> 00:46:08.300
I, what I signed up for, uh, for this day. This is exactly what I've been looking forward to and,

254
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:13.080
and if I have to wait 30 even more days for it, it's ok. Like if I have to wait 20 more days or five

255
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:21.239
more days or whatever it is, I can do that because I know what's waiting for me under the tree. And

256
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:34.040
so because I know I'm, I'm just content with the present regardless of the presence. So I don't know

257
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:40.560
about you. But this story reminds me of a moment in Zachariah's life where the angel has to tell him,

258
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:47.469
Zechariah, I know you're scared because that's what the holiness of God does. That's the presence of God

259
00:46:47.479 --> 00:46:53.879
does. It, it shocks us, it scares us. It's calling us to live in a way that we're not accustomed to.

260
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.560
You know, we're, we're comfortable with this. You know, I'm good with following Jesus at this level.

261
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:09.820
I, I I'm good in believing in Jesus at this level. I'm good in trusting Jesus at this level and, and

262
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:15.399
in terms of happiness, I'm good with that in terms of presence, I'm good with that. But if it goes

263
00:47:15.409 --> 00:47:22.929
beyond this, then that's when I get scared and what the story reveals is that, that the angel has to

264
00:47:22.939 --> 00:47:29.520
tell Zachariah don't be afraid because there's a new level to experience here. And I want you to

265
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:35.110
transition out of a place where you're just accepting things the way they are and just dealing with

266
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:42.050
the everyday happiness of life. When I've got real joy to give you. The problem is Zachariah doesn't

267
00:47:42.189 --> 00:47:50.449
really want it and, and, and he forgets what he's prayed for. You know, I, I, I've been in moments

268
00:47:50.459 --> 00:47:56.429
in my life where I have prayed and I have asked God to do things and then forgotten that I had asked

269
00:47:58.139 --> 00:48:04.129
and, and then it happens and I'm like God, I prayed for this and you answered. Now, I even forgot

270
00:48:04.139 --> 00:48:10.889
about it. I even stopped believing that it could still happen and you've answered my prayer and, and

271
00:48:10.899 --> 00:48:17.280
what God does is is that He, he never forgets a prayer. So the Bible tells us that on the first day

272
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.070
that you pray it, he already gives an answer to it.

273
00:48:23.189 --> 00:48:30.090
Now, it may take time before that answer gets to you. There may be obstacles in the way and

274
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:36.510
spiritual battles that are happening. It may be because there are things that have yet to come

275
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:43.959
together for your good. But it doesn't mean that God has not answered. And what this moment reveals

276
00:48:43.969 --> 00:48:52.179
is that in the moments in which Zachariah and Elizabeth were praying God had I answered and he says,

277
00:48:52.189 --> 00:48:59.280
your prayer has been heard and he says your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you were to call

278
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:06.260
him John. The problem is, is that well like a lot of us, Zachariah just got used to not having a son.

279
00:49:08.699 --> 00:49:15.500
He got used to his wife being barren. He got used to his situation being the way that it was and and

280
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.979
others just looking at him and his wife as not being as blessed as everyone else.

281
00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:32.540
And yet God is saying, I believe he's saying this to you. Why are you giving up on the prayer?

282
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:41.889
Why are you giving up on me when I am still able to do it?

283
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.320
I hope that speaks to you

284
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:53.659
that speaks to the moment in which you're in the moment where you, you resign to the fact that

285
00:49:53.669 --> 00:50:01.419
things are just going to stay the same because this story is all about God saying if you have prayed

286
00:50:01.429 --> 00:50:03.760
it, I have answered it

287
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:13.679
and I am ready to show you that no matter how much time passes, I am still the God that answers your

288
00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:14.080
prayer

289
00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:28.060
in verse 14. He says that he is going to be a joy and that he's going to be a delight to you. See

290
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:35.000
the, the answer prayer is a joy. It is a delight, but then it does something else. It, it, it makes

291
00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:41.770
it so that others also rejoice because of its birth. And, and I look at this. And I say, God, you

292
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:47.530
know, sometimes just like a child is in a mother's womb and we don't see it, we don't see what's

293
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:54.969
happening. We don't see what's going on, but you are just like that at work, making sure that when

294
00:50:54.979 --> 00:51:03.870
the time comes, it will be fulfilled. And so the story continues in Luke one and verse 18, where

295
00:51:04.439 --> 00:51:12.370
Zachariah asks the angel and he says, how can I be sure of this? And you see he was fearful, but now

296
00:51:12.379 --> 00:51:19.030
he's also doubtful. Have ever been those two things just fearful and doubtful, you know, fearful and

297
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:24.620
doubtful, even though God has just shown up in a way that you've never seen him shown up in your

298
00:51:24.629 --> 00:51:33.070
life before. He is like a physical manifestation. He is alive in front of you. He was speaking to

299
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:42.090
you. He is revealing his will to you and yet you're still afraid and yet you're still doubting and,

300
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:47.639
and that goes to show you that even if you've never had an experience like Zachariah has here, guess

301
00:51:47.649 --> 00:51:56.169
what? We've all had this experience of being fearful and doubtful in the face of wanting to have

302
00:51:56.179 --> 00:52:03.760
faith in the face of wanting and desiring to experience joy. And then he says, here are the reasons

303
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:12.820
why it shouldn't happen. Have you ever talked to yourself out of a blessing? I, I think that we do

304
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:18.889
that more often than we realize. And I think what the story does is that, it reveals that we

305
00:52:18.899 --> 00:52:23.669
shouldn't talk ourselves out of a blessing that God has promised

306
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:32.649
you let God make that decision. Don't make that decision for God. I hear when people make decisions

307
00:52:32.659 --> 00:52:41.040
for other people, uh they're probably too busy. They, they probably aren't going to come every time

308
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:48.330
I text them, it takes them forever to text me back. Even if I call, they never pick up, why should I

309
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.030
invite them? Why should I take that extra step? You know, it's probably not going to work out

310
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:58.389
anyways. I mean, I've, I've heard other people get rejected. They went and asked for a raise. Why

311
00:52:58.399 --> 00:53:04.429
should I go and ask for one? It's gonna be no, it was no for them, it's probably gonna be no for me.

312
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:13.020
Why should it be different? Have you ever talked yourself out of a blessing? Have you ever made

313
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:18.350
decisions for another person? I believe the answer is yes. And, and I believe that this story

314
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:25.459
reveals exactly that because what Zechariah does in speaking to the angel is he says this, "I'm an

315
00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:32.750
old man and my wife is well along in years." Look, the one thing that Zechariah does here, if you

316
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:39.449
can put that verse back up in verse 18, is that he knows that after his acts of service are

317
00:53:39.459 --> 00:53:48.050
ended in the temple, he has to go back home to Elizabeth. And so he makes sure that he says, I'm old

318
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:52.360
and my wife is well along in years. Isn't that a nice way to put it?

319
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:04.620
He, he doesn't, he doesn't, like, give her age away. He doesn't say that she's old too. She's older

320
00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:10.149
than me. Like, you know, she's all dried up and shriveled up like she doesn't, he didn't say

321
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:11.110
anything like that.

322
00:54:13.439 --> 00:54:18.270
She hasn't been able to have kids in like, at least 40 years. Lord. Like, he doesn't say any of that,

323
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:29.800
right? But, but he he does point out that the situation isn't hopeful but but he says this after the

324
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:36.320
angel already gave him the promise. Do you understand what's happening here? So God spoke, gave the

325
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:43.439
promise and and Zachariah is just struggling to believe in it. And, and I think the story is not

326
00:54:43.449 --> 00:54:50.310
about what God has promised. It's the struggle that we're having in believing in the promises of God

327
00:54:52.540 --> 00:55:03.389
because time has passed, I'm not 24 anymore. And, and so because time has gone by, I look at my life

328
00:55:03.399 --> 00:55:08.959
and I say, well, it's probably never going to happen. If it hasn't happened yet, then it won't

329
00:55:08.969 --> 00:55:18.169
happen. Who are you to decide that when God is making sure that you understand that you cannot make

330
00:55:18.179 --> 00:55:28.989
that decision for the Lord. It is for you to believe in the Lord and wait on him to reveal what his

331
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:38.399
decision is. It is different, right? Different and yet still a struggle and still a struggle, even

332
00:55:38.409 --> 00:55:44.070
for Zachariah. And so in verse 19, the angel says to him, and he has to tell him this, he has to do

333
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:52.560
it because he has to reveal his authority. And he says, look, I'm not just any angel here. Um I'm an

334
00:55:52.570 --> 00:56:00.070
archangel. I am in command of one third of, of those angels.

335
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:06.750
And I want you to know that I stand in the presence of God,

336
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:15.810
which means that He is always there unless God tells him to do something else.

337
00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:26.120
And this is something else Zachariah was to come and talk to your doubting old face.

338
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:35.419
You can kind of sense the frustration a little bit right in Gabriel, it's like, dude, really

339
00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:46.889
like, like if there was a moment in which it should be written, like, dude, really, it's here, like

340
00:56:46.899 --> 00:56:47.570
really

341
00:56:49.629 --> 00:56:55.590
and, and, and in this moment he's like telling him I've been sent to speak to you and to tell you

342
00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:07.060
this good news and, and what I'm seeing is that there's just no joy. It is done like, you know, I'm

343
00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:13.239
here sharing joy, but you're not experiencing joy. So this is what I know. I know that God can speak

344
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:17.090
joy, but it's still up to us to experience joy.

345
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:28.149
God can promise joy, but it's still for me to seize joy. And in the moment in which there in, in

346
00:57:28.159 --> 00:57:38.179
verse 20 it says now Zachariah, you're gonna be silent and you're not going to be able to speak

347
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:46.560
until this day happens because you did not believe my words, which will come true at the appointed

348
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:53.560
time. So he's telling him you're not going to be able to speak. And I always thought about that like,

349
00:57:53.600 --> 00:58:04.870
why is this important and the judgment of not being able to speak? II, I kind of struggled with this

350
00:58:04.879 --> 00:58:09.100
in this text a little bit. And I, and I, I don't think I have a full answer. OK. So I'm not gonna

351
00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:18.280
pretend that I do, but I do think that what's happening in this story is this because he's being

352
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.199
overtaken by fear and doubt.

353
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:30.610
And even after he had this incredible revelation and he's still struggling with being able to

354
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:36.350
believe in the promise and experience joy. God is gonna make sure that Zachariah

355
00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:47.550
doesn't propagate doesn't keep spreading that fear and that doubt to other people,

356
00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:53.290
it's always going to silence him.

357
00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:03.500
I, I have, I have been silenced before in my life. Like, like literally my mom had to put tape over

358
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:12.590
my mouth one time. I, I remember it still as a child. It happened. I, I wasn't kidnapped, but I, I

359
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.679
remember this moment very vividly and, and I remember she had to do it because I just wouldn't shut

360
00:59:18.689 --> 00:59:23.510
up. I wouldn't stop. And uh and she also tied me

361
00:59:25.899 --> 00:59:32.199
and put me in a dark furnace. Now my mom is dead. So I can tell the story. But if she was alive, I

362
00:59:32.209 --> 00:59:36.709
couldn't say it, but I'm telling it because I think looking back, you know, the way we were

363
00:59:36.719 --> 00:59:44.590
disciplined, um, in the eighties was questionable on every level. Anybody else agree, like, just

364
00:59:44.719 --> 00:59:51.610
this craziness. Right. But, but the fact is, is that I was silenced. Right. I had to be silenced and,

365
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:59.010
and I look at the story and, and I see that Zachariah had to be silenced too. Now, the reason he was

366
00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:06.379
silenced was because you know, he was just going to maybe speak all the things that were still not

367
01:00:06.389 --> 01:00:11.790
settled in his heart. And we know this because the time comes when it comes time when his son is

368
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:20.629
born and, and, and you would think that that would be the moment in which um listen to this, his the

369
01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:30.229
birth itself would have taken away the silence and given him back his speech. But the only thing

370
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:37.760
that gives Zachariah back in his speech is when he says his name shall be John.

371
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:50.989
See the birth of the promise, was it what released Zachariah from the curse? And the judgment, what

372
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.310
released him was when he spoke the promise,

373
01:00:58.899 --> 01:01:04.379
it wasn't enough for the promise to be born. Zachariah had to speak the promise.

374
01:01:06.449 --> 01:01:08.429
And I want you to think about that in your own life

375
01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:18.020
and why it is that maybe the promise has not yet been fulfilled? Could it be

376
01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:25.689
that the promise has been birthed? But you still don't speak it

377
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:38.800
now? What happens if you are speaking it all the time? What is it if you're declaring it over your

378
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:47.189
life over and over and over again? Well, the Bible tells us something else in Luke chapter one verse

379
01:01:47.199 --> 01:01:53.469
57. Look at this verse it says that when it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth

380
01:01:53.479 --> 01:02:01.159
to her son. And then in verse 58 her relatives, her neighbors, they all heard that the Lord had

381
01:02:01.169 --> 01:02:08.530
shown her great mercy and then they all shared her joy. The Bible says that this was a moment of

382
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:17.550
blessing, not just for her and for him, but for all those around them. And so when God blesses and

383
01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:24.459
he gives us joy, it's so that others experience it too. And so I wonder if maybe what we're praying

384
01:02:24.469 --> 01:02:31.290
for asking for what we're demanding of God and, and believing in Him for isn't going to bless other

385
01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:36.949
people. It's only going to bless us. See, I, I would, I would think about what it is that you would

386
01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:45.570
do if God gave you a child, what would that child be to you? Just your child? Or would you have

387
01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:50.770
hopes and dreams and passions and desires for that child to be used by God in a way that it would

388
01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:59.729
make a difference in the world if God gave you $100,000 more this year in this coming year than the

389
01:02:59.739 --> 01:03:06.479
year before. How would that change your life. What would you do with that money? What would you do

390
01:03:06.489 --> 01:03:13.979
different rather than pursuing happiness? How would it reveal joy where it not only blesses you but

391
01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:20.729
blesses those around you. See, God is, is, is, is wanting to answer our prayers because He's already

392
01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:26.679
promised us incredible things. The problem is that He can't trust us with those prayers you had

393
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:32.040
because we're still stuck on happiness when we should be pursuing joy.

394
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:45.340
I think about this story is that even though His faith and his words fail Zachariah, just like they

395
01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:59.239
fail us. God makes sure that the blessing of His promise still comes to pass. And I look at that and

396
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:04.969
I say God that encourages me so much, doesn't it encourage you that even though they messed up in

397
01:04:04.979 --> 01:04:12.459
the story, it doesn't stop God from going ahead and giving the promise. It didn't stop Him from

398
01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:22.860
doing what needed to be done. And, and so why choosing joy brings joy is because it's never about

399
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:29.439
getting what you want. It's always about appreciating what you already have. Yes, but it's more than

400
01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:37.340
that. It's believing in what God has already promised you and moving in that direction, you need to

401
01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:47.290
move in the presence of God and believe in the process of the promise of God. And so joy isn't the

402
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:54.139
easiest choice and it's certainly not the obvious choice, but joy is always the choice that we need

403
01:04:54.149 --> 01:05:02.729
to make because joy is promised. But joy is also a choice and Zachariah fails in making that choice

404
01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:09.469
and we don't want that to be us. So how are things gonna be different? Well, in this story, there

405
01:05:09.479 --> 01:05:18.840
are three key things, three key things that happen when your joy is taken from you. And, and if we

406
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:23.870
can understand what these three things are, we're gonna be able to point them out as they're

407
01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:33.340
happening in our life. So your joy is always gonna be taken from you when you give up on a God given

408
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:33.750
dream.

409
01:05:36.189 --> 01:05:43.500
And that's what we see in the story of Zachariah and Elizabeth. They gave up on the dream, but God

410
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:52.429
did not give up on it. They stopped believing it could happen, but God never did. Where is it in

411
01:05:52.439 --> 01:06:01.790
your life that you have given up that God is speaking to you right now and telling you that's not

412
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
what I asked you to do.

413
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:13.830
I believe that we can find 123 areas easily. I, I'm thinking of some right now as I'm standing

414
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:20.010
before you, I'm thinking, you know, at this point in time of my life, these things should have

415
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:24.629
happened, Laura and they haven't, they probably won't. And we're thinking like that because we have

416
01:06:24.639 --> 01:06:30.860
given up on a God given dream. But how old was Zachariah and Elizabeth when their dream came true?

417
01:06:32.629 --> 01:06:40.479
See it, it came true. Not because they gave up on it. But became true because God never did see God

418
01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:46.280
answered their prayer on the first day, they prayed it. So I want you to know that God is keeping

419
01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:53.219
track, not just of your prayers. He's keeping track of your dreams. And even after you've given up

420
01:06:53.229 --> 01:06:59.959
on them, he hasn't not one bit, he hasn't given up on you. He hasn't given up on the dream. He

421
01:06:59.969 --> 01:07:07.570
hasn't given up on answering your prayer. Can we say amen to that? Come on, you're not encouraged by

422
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:15.879
that. You know, that's what the story is about. You know, it's about having joy restored into our

423
01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:25.040
lives. And God is saying, I, I know how it gets taken away from you, but this is how it can't be

424
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:25.979
taken from you.

425
01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:32.500
I know how you can stop believing in it, but this is how you can start believing in it again.

426
01:07:34.669 --> 01:07:40.689
Here's the second one when you submit and surrender to a difficult situation,

427
01:07:42.889 --> 01:07:48.179
sometimes we just stop fighting, we stop caring, we stop believing, we stop trusting, we stop

428
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:56.399
wanting the very thing that we had fought so long for and we just accept things the way they are or

429
01:07:56.409 --> 01:07:59.909
we accept whatever is left over.

430
01:08:02.189 --> 01:08:11.110
You know, II, I have found myself in moments of my life in very vivid moments, making a choice and

431
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:20.569
making decisions to settle instead of waiting and believing and trusting for the fulfillment of

432
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:29.559
God's promise. Anybody else I chose happiness over joy. So I, I wouldn't have called it that then I

433
01:08:29.568 --> 01:08:35.628
wouldn't have seen it as such, but that's what it was. See, I was looking for happiness in that

434
01:08:35.639 --> 01:08:41.149
moment. And so I went ahead with a relationship that I knew I shouldn't have gone ahead with. I went

435
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.410
ahead with a business deal that I thought would be prosperous. I went ahead with doing this and

436
01:08:46.419 --> 01:08:53.259
doing that and doing things that I believed we're all within the realm of God's blessing and his

437
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:58.419
promise to me only to discover that those were just moments of happiness and none of them had

438
01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:04.430
anything to do with the joy that he had promised me. It was me settling from what I thought was good

439
01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:11.359
enough. And even though it wasn't happening in a way that was righteous, I felt well, what is

440
01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:12.470
righteousness

441
01:09:15.539 --> 01:09:22.830
when I can have happiness? See, righteousness is the standard of God's holiness. And I always

442
01:09:22.839 --> 01:09:31.060
thought that if I brought something into my life, I being in my life is enough of, of the happiness

443
01:09:31.629 --> 01:09:36.479
that I'm looking for and seeking for and, and needing, that's all I need is really this happiness

444
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:41.270
except God was trying to show me that. No, I don't want you to just be happy. I want you to be

445
01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:49.620
joyful because what I'm gonna give you isn't going to be taken from you ever. It's never gonna end.

446
01:09:50.759 --> 01:09:56.620
It's gonna be something that is gonna continue to speak of my favor. And blessing of promise in your

447
01:09:56.629 --> 01:10:03.709
life. And even after it ends, it cannot end because it lives beyond death. Just like Jesus, the

448
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:12.330
right hand of the father. You see the promise is that, see, the promise that Jesus had that gave him

449
01:10:12.339 --> 01:10:19.339
the joy to endure the cross was that he knew he would live again and he would find himself where he

450
01:10:19.399 --> 01:10:28.890
always was meant to be back at the right hand of the Father. Can we say amen to that? See, it didn't

451
01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:35.569
change for him even after death. So he always had that joy. And so what we do is we settle for the

452
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:42.359
happiness at the expense of the joy. And God is saying, don't do that. And so whatever the difficult

453
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:47.520
situation is, stop submitting and surrendering to it. And so that's what Elizabeth and Zachariah did.

454
01:10:47.529 --> 01:10:52.879
They submitted and they surrendered, they just accepted things the way they are. Where is it in your

455
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:58.560
life right now where you have submitted and surrendered instead of believing in the promise of God.

456
01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:04.620
Where is it? I want you to say to the Lord right now, you tell him, you tell him say I'm not going

457
01:11:04.629 --> 01:11:09.240
to submit. I'm not going to surrender to this area of my life anymore. I'm not going to settle for

458
01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:18.180
happiness. I'm going for joy. I'm going for the full thing. Here's the third thing. The third thing

459
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:24.560
is that when you stop believing and praying that the miracle is going to happen. And then the story

460
01:11:24.569 --> 01:11:32.589
in which we're in, um it's not by coincidence that Zachariah uh reaches Zachariah reaches the

461
01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:39.810
revelation of God at the altar of the incense with the prayers he had stopped believing and he had

462
01:11:39.819 --> 01:11:45.270
stopped praying. And so what, what, what God does is that he shows up right where it is that he

463
01:11:45.279 --> 01:11:46.310
never should have left

464
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.560
back at the place that he never should have left. So ask yourself, where is it that you have stopped

465
01:11:53.569 --> 01:11:58.299
praying? Where is it that you stopped believing? Where is that? You've stopped trusting God for Him

466
01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:05.149
to do something? Maybe you just stop believing and stop trusting that God can save someone in your

467
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:11.120
life, someone in your family, someone in your relationship, you just stopped. You just accept the

468
01:12:11.129 --> 01:12:16.740
way that it is. Why, why have you stopped praying? Why have you stopped believing? Why have you

469
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:23.859
stopped at happiness when God wants to give you joy? Can we say amen to that? Why I'll tell you why?

470
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:30.040
Because we are conditioned to do that. And so you need to fight that conditioning. You need to fight

471
01:12:30.049 --> 01:12:35.589
that culture. You need to fight that which constantly divides you from understanding these two

472
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:42.500
differences. Don't stop fighting, don't stop believing, don't stop praying. Don't stop submitting to

473
01:12:42.509 --> 01:12:53.640
God. Don't stop. You don't give up on your God given dream because God is ready to give you His joy.

474
01:12:54.140 --> 01:13:01.689
Stop selling for happiness. When joy is there all along? Are you ready for joy instead of happiness?

475
01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:09.470
Are you ready for that in your life? And the promise of that? Hey, would you just stand with me as

476
01:13:09.479 --> 01:13:15.600
we were closing a word of prayer? And uh we're gonna sing one more song before we go and, and head

477
01:13:15.609 --> 01:13:23.750
off into um the after party and, and I, I wanna encourage you today to really believe in, in the

478
01:13:23.759 --> 01:13:31.520
promise that God has, has given you. I don't want you to stop believing, stop trusting. I want you

479
01:13:31.529 --> 01:13:37.069
to stop asking for that miracle. Don't just settle for the happiness but, but, but reach all the way

480
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:43.609
for the joy. And I, and I love the fact that, that he just reached into Zachariah's life and

481
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:50.029
Elizabeth's life and reminded them of that just like he can do that for us right now and, and he's

482
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:56.830
gonna do that even as we pray. And so father, I, I look to you and I look to these people and I say,

483
01:13:57.009 --> 01:14:03.479
Father, I know that you have incredible things that you want to give them and do in their life and

484
01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:12.740
they have settled in areas where you have not asked them to, they have just chosen happiness over

485
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:20.790
your joy. They have selected their presence instead of wanting to live in your presence. And I pray

486
01:14:20.799 --> 01:14:28.399
that right now father, that you would reveal what the fullness of your joy is for them that you

487
01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:34.970
would reveal and that you would declare your promises over their life right now, that they would not

488
01:14:34.979 --> 01:14:42.049
settle for what it is that they have when you have promised them so much more. Lord, you have so

489
01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:47.620
much more you wanna do in them and through them, so much more, you wanna give them and trust them so

490
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:56.569
much more that you wanna bless them with and, and, and, and just see abundantly multiplied so that

491
01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:04.609
others can be blessed as well. And so for right now, father, we pray that we today are declaring we

492
01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:13.169
are becoming enemies of happiness and we are becoming warriors for joy.

493
01:15:15.209 --> 01:15:24.870
We will not settle for anything less and the joy that comes from your presence, that is the Holy

494
01:15:24.879 --> 01:15:33.629
Spirit and the fulfillment of your promises over our life. And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen.

495
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:42.660
Amen. Amen. You believe that for yourself today, you believe that over your life. God's gonna do

496
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:47.830
something incredible for you as you continue to move in this direction. Let's sing this song

497
01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:53.120
together and then Amadeus is gonna come back out and just dismiss us for today and we've got some

498
01:15:53.129 --> 01:15:58.439
incredible services that are planned in this series called Joy. This is just the beginning. I spent

499
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:03.350
a lot of time introducing the topic and, but I believe that the next moments are gonna be even more

500
01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:09.509
powerful. There's some insights that God has uh shared with us that I believe are gonna just gonna

501
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:15.770
be powerful moments. Look right till the end of this month, we have services on the 24th and again

502
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:22.569
on the 31st. So just in case you're wondering if those services are happening, the answer is yes,

503
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:28.089
they're gonna happen at the same time at 1030. We will be here and we want to encourage you that if

504
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:33.410
you have an hour to spare on a Sunday morning on the 24th or even on the 31st, that you would come

505
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:41.979
and that you would end this year in the best way possible. So we can have the greatest year possible

506
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:48.459
in 2024. Can we trust God for that? Amen. God bless you. Thank you so much.

507
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:58.939
We're gonna sing our first Christmas song. Are you guys ready? Joy to the world? This bit of Peter?

508
01:16:59.580 --> 01:16:59.930
W

535
01:21:13.419 --> 01:21:15.240
joy to the world. Thank you.

536
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:32.649
We hope you are encouraged today that you're leaving with a little bit more, hope, a little bit more

537
01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:39.839
joy. I wanna direct you to our prayer team that will be at the front um on my right. If there is

538
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:44.709
something that you've been dreaming for a God given dream, maybe something you've given up on and

539
01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:51.870
you want renewed joy and someone to partner with you to come alongside you in prayer and pray for

540
01:21:51.879 --> 01:21:58.169
you for that. Please come up front on my right, the prayer team will be there to meet with you. Um

541
01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:05.839
As I say, every time I'm up here, church does not end on a Sunday. It's a whole week long thing. So

542
01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:13.270
if you need anything, please look us up on our website or our social media, someone will reach back

543
01:22:13.279 --> 01:22:19.490
out to you and finally please come and meet us at our after party. We're here to talk to you. We

544
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:25.129
wanna know who you are and for you to get to know us. So have a blessed week everybody and we'll see

545
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:25.790
you at the back.
