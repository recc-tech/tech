1
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.320
morning. So good to have you with us so glad that you could be here at River's Edge community church

2
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.700
and pastors. Oh and it's my pleasure to welcome you into the Lord's house today and being able to

3
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.840
worship him together and be on a spiritual journey at the pace that we're at is one of the

4
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.140
privileges that we have and being in a relationship with Jesus, he not only accepts us the way we

5
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.263
are, but he helps us to journey to the place where he knows that we can be our best selves and it's

6
00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:08.893
with him increasing in us and us decreasing in the areas that keep tripping us up and leading into

7
00:06:08.893 --> 00:06:17.123
places of darkness and places that make us feel like we can never measure up. That Jesus is here to

8
00:06:17.123 --> 00:06:22.723
challenge and I pray that he would do that through everything that we would offer today as an

9
00:06:22.723 --> 00:06:30.556
opportunity to worship him. And so as we would sing these songs or as you would hear a message as

10
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:36.256
the kids would be ministered to along with the youth in the annex everything that would happen today,

11
00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:42.986
even the after party that we would take place at the end of the gathering that we would be able to

12
00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:50.616
experience real community. And so I would ask that you would just join me and standing as we would

13
00:06:50.626 --> 00:07:00.680
open in a word of prayer as we give ourselves and our minds and hearts to him and ask God to reveal

14
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:08.970
himself powerfully today and as others would make their way and joining us both here in person and

15
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.890
online. I know that God has something special for each and every one of us. And so Lord, we thank

16
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.040
you. That today is a day in which we can worship you and glorify you. That even in the daily

17
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.790
struggle of being able to be there in your presence can sometimes be the biggest challenge of the

18
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.940
day. Having you be a part of everything in our lives and involving you in the areas where we try to

19
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.470
just do it on our own can be the biggest challenge for each of us. But today, Lord, as we would like,

20
00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:49.955
learn how to surrender into your presence, learn how to give people over to you, learn how to give

21
00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:57.095
ourselves to you and our problems to you that you would reveal your victory for each of us and we

22
00:07:57.095 --> 00:08:02.965
pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Let's continue to worship together. Would you welcome the River's

23
00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:04.245
Edge? Worship team

24
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.550
Amazing grace. Let's sing this together.

25
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.830
Who brings some power

26
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:44.050
Glory? The king above all kings. That's right

27
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:54.690
who shakes up with holy thunder and leaves us reckless

28
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.800
glory. The king about balking.

29
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.770
This is amazing. Great.

30
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.910
You would take my

31
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.790
there, you would

32
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.110

33
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.280
Jesus. I sing for all that you've done for me.

34
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.040
Nation with truth and justice.

35
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.870
All of it's brilliant.

36
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.120
This is amazing.

37
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.790
This is

38
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.590
then you will take my

39
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.040
Jesus

40
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.620
that you've done for

41
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.900
lane. Let's proclaim this. The king who conquered the

42
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.190
plane.

43

This is a failing

49
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.390
that you would take my

50
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.380

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.330
Grace!

80
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:09.650
Thanks. Let's take the time now to thank the Lord with all our heart, praise your name

81
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:40.270
and I don't have enough. I'm never living enough lifetimes to fully know your world to know all that

82
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.500
You deserve

83
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:59.410
deception. All of my duplicity. Now, there is no record because you assume the best of me. This is

84
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:07.630
why for saving me when I was weak. So I will sing. This is why

85
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:28.660
all of my affection. Everything I have to give some of my attention is measured in the praise I live.

86
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:38.510
This is how I thank you for saving me when I was weak. So I was saying this is

87
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:41.870
everything

88
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.700
that again, This is how I

89
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:57.430
me and keeping me. So I will sing. This is how I for everything.

90
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.030
I will sing jane

91
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:13.800

92
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.580
praises to you, I will sing, I will sing.

93
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.300
It says

94
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:44.540
for saving me when I was weak. So I was saying this is how for everything.

95
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.230
Since how

96
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.770
this is how I think

97
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.390
yesterday.

98
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.690
Alright. That was amazing, wasn't it?

99
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:34.620
See now you're saying this pastor must be humble. He brings out his own table. Yeah, so that wasn't

100
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.890
a very humble thing to say. So probably not.

101
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:49.340
It's great to see you guys. Are you guys happy I am to, it's great, so great to be with you and we

102
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.610
just want to share some quick announcement before we continue with our gathering. And the first one

103
00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:00.580
is with regards to our community kitchen and so our team got together this weekend and made the

104
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:06.140
meals that we are going to be serving today and those are for those that would need them. And

105
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:12.220
there's also other supplies and clothing and things that you'd be able to partake in today. And so

106
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:19.230
we would encourage you to help us get the word out that the community kitchen ministry is back and

107
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:25.740
today is a soft launch for us. We want to see how many meals we would need and, And want to see

108
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:33.060
these numbers grow. It's all about starting somewhere and seeing that continue to the place where we

109
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:40.790
used to be at, which was uh 200 meals a week. And so we want to definitely be an impact and a light

110
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:46.010
in this community. And so if you can help us spread the word that community kitchen is back, can we

111
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.390
applaud our volunteers for all the amazing hard work.

112
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:57.520
And so we also have four ways that you can give and they're up there on the screen. You choose the

113
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.720
one that is most convenient for you. And we thank you for your donation and your contribution today.

114
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:08.310
And we also have our youth ministry happening today in the annex. And if you don't know what the

115
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:15.620
annex is, that is our daycare during the week from Monday to Friday and it's building that is joined

116
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:21.170
to us. And so at the very back where you'll see a sign that says check in. That's where you will

117
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:29.160
make your way into the facility that will be used for youth today. And then we also have our kids

118
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:37.220
ministry happening today as well. So we have ministry for all ages. And so the kids are no different.

119
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.850
Let's take a look at this video.

120
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.900
All right. So we're gonna dismiss the kids and the youth, you guys can go and parents who can help

121
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.450
them check in will be someone there to help you with you with that. And your teacher today is uh is

122
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:34.230
Danielle, so she's gonna be there to receive you guys and uh, and Monica as well. So I'll see you

123
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:41.090
guys in a bit and uh we'll have treats for you all at the end at the after party and that's gonna

124
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:46.040
take place at the end of the gathering. So we encourage you to stick around, enjoy some refreshments

125
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:53.350
and also take part in community. And we know that that's the best way to feel connected and feel

126
00:23:53.350 --> 00:24:00.820
like this is not just church, but it becomes like extended family. So, we have a new series that we

127
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:08.990
are starting today. And that series is called fresh start. It's about revisiting the past for a

128
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:15.480
better future. It's about looking at stories in the scriptures where God encouraged people to do

129
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.760
exactly that. And so I want us to watch this video and then we'll continue with our gathering as we

130
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.320
take a look in Luke chapter 19 today. And look at the story of

131
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:54.530
so today is topic is a restitution. And if we don't know what that word means, we're going to

132
00:24:54.530 --> 00:25:01.000
understand it by the end of this message. It's one of those things that's found throughout the

133
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.020
scriptures, but not one of those things that we know a whole lot about. It's one of those stories in

134
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:13.800
the Bible that we may have heard if we ever went to church as a child and we may have even heard a

135
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:22.230
song about it, something that goes along the lines of there was a wee little man, anybody know good,

136
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:29.090
you weren't brainwashed as a child, I was and there was a wee little man and his name was Chaos and

137
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:35.210
he had climbed the tree because he couldn't see Jesus. And it seemed like that was all this story

138
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:45.120
was about, it was about being height challenged in the scriptures and what happens when your height

139
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.950
challenged? Well, you've got maybe a few more obstacles to overcome. Well, in the story that we're

140
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:56.200
gonna be looking at, we're gonna get to the core of the real message and the message is one of

141
00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:03.880
restitution and in luke chapter 19, in verse one, I'm gonna read you the story. It starts at verse

142
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.610
one and then it continues into verse 10 and it says that Jesus entered Jericho and he's made his way

143
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:16.120
through the town and that there was a man there named Zacchaeus and he was the chief tax collector in

144
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:23.690
the region. So he had a very high position and this made him extremely wealthy. It says that he had

145
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:31.770
become very rich because of this position that he had and he tried to get a look at Jesus, but he

146
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:40.660
was too short to see over the crowd. And so he ran ahead and he climbed a sycamore victory beside

147
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:48.980
the road because Jesus was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus

148
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:58.220
and he called him by name, Jesus, I never met him before, but knew exactly who he was and said, Zacchaeus,

149
00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:11.270
he said quick, come down and then says the words, I must be a guest in your home today. And what

150
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:19.930
Jesus does in the story is that he picks the most notorious sinner, the person who was the most

151
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:29.470
hated and says, you're the guy I came to see and if there's anywhere I need to be today and if

152
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:40.540
there's anyone that I want to be with, it's with you at your house. This Jesus is crazy. He does

153
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:50.010
things that just keep surprising us, that just keeps shocking us. He does things in a way that we

154
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:58.510
would never even imagine to step out with that kind of boldness and do, we would be way too

155
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:05.870
concerned about ourselves, our reputation, how this would come back to hurt us and and and harm us

156
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:11.690
and and and affect us. And and he was already being criticized all the time. And you would think

157
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:22.930
that he'd be avoiding any opportunity to give people more fodder to gossip with. But you see, he

158
00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:30.420
doesn't care about any of that Jesus is concerned about Zacchaeus

159
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.220
and whether he had been in the tree

160
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:43.760
or he had been taller than the tree, it wouldn't have made a difference because Jesus would have

161
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:52.870
said the exact same words because this isn't about his height, but this is about understanding how

162
00:28:52.870 --> 00:29:04.930
God has come in, the person of Jesus to show us that we may have gotten it all wrong. And so in the

163
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:13.260
story, Zacchaeus quickly climbs down and he takes Jesus to his house and and and in great excitement

164
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:21.830
and enjoy and then he says, but the people, they were displeased, he has gone to be the guest of a

165
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:31.090
notorious sinner. They grumbled. And meanwhile Zakia stood before the Lord and said, I will give

166
00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.400
half my wealth to the poor

167
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:46.170
and Lord. If I have cheated people on their taxes, I will give them back four times as much.

168
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:59.500
And then Jesus is then able to say these words. Salvation has come to this house today because this

169
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:09.830
man has shown himself to be a true son of Abraham, for the son of man came to seek and save those

170
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:19.440
who are lost. Can we say amen to the reading of his word. It is such a beautiful, powerful story of

171
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:31.920
redemption. About a fresh start. When Jesus reached out to another tax collector, his name was Levi.

172
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:43.690
We know him as Matthew. And I can't help but imagine that now, almost 3.5 years later, this dude by

173
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:53.460
the name of Zacchaeus somehow had heard about what had happened to his friend Levi

174
00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:06.210
and that when Jesus came to town that he would have done everything to see him in person, anything

175
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:12.800
to hear, what do you have to say? Because if he could reach out to someone like Levi and make him

176
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:23.820
one of his disciples, then maybe just, maybe there was hope for me. Yeah. And of course, wherever

177
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:31.420
Jesus went, the crowds followed him and we can't know what really motivated Zacchaeus And I'm

178
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:40.190
definitely speculating here on what could have happened, but it's interesting to see that he won't

179
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:50.280
let anything stop him. And I've often thought like, what is it that prevents me from moving forward.

180
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:56.640
And often I have arrived at this conclusion and maybe you'll agree, not just for me before yourself,

181
00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:03.060
that the reason I don't go further in life is I'm the reason anybody else.

182
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:13.510
And I think there's something in the chaos that speaks to him about the fact that he is not going

183
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:20.660
further and not accomplishing more because the person who is standing most in the way is actually

184
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:30.050
himself. And the first thing we see is that the chaos gets out of the way of himself, he overcomes

185
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:38.450
himself. And so the first step to restitution is that we have to overcome yourself, You have to

186
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:44.760
overcome yourself because if you don't overcome yourself, then you'll never get to the place where

187
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:52.660
you can make amends, you see, he has to get out of his own way and and to do that, he's not gonna

188
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:58.820
let anything stand in the way, including his height, including a crowd, including the fact that

189
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:05.100
nobody wants him there, he's not going to be concerned about any of these things. Today. Today is

190
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:12.170
not a day where you want to look tall, when you're short in a crowd of tall people, Today is not a

191
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:18.880
day where you hold onto your pride because you don't want people making fun of you for the rest of

192
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:27.820
your life because they see you in a tree. Today is not the day that you hold on to your proud self.

193
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:33.800
Today is the day that you surrender that because the most important thing today is overcoming

194
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:43.470
yourself is not standing in the way of what you know, you need the most and over and over again.

195
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:49.760
I've just seen people stand in the way of that. They hold onto their pride. I don't need that.

196
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:57.130
Everyone else sees that you need it, but you still won't accept it. You still won't believe it. You

197
00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:03.630
still don't want to hear it. And you do everything imaginable to resist that and to fight that every

198
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.760
step of the way and people are just trying to love you.

199
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:16.520
They're just trying to tell you what it is that you should already know.

200
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.100
And I think we've all been in that place where we're just not ready.

201
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.130
We're just not there.

202
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:35.920
And I love how God shows up in the person of Jesus on the day in which the cases

203
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.570
and when that day comes for you, like it's come many times in my life for me,

204
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:56.080
when Jesus says come down, will you do something, will you get all the way down?

205
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:10.060
I think we've lost this posture of kneeling, how many of us still Neil once in a while, like when

206
00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.620
you pray, you know what I'm saying, like you just kneel, I don't, I don't mean like, you know,

207
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:21.730
begging someone to let you back in the house, I mean like I think we've been there two or back into

208
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:32.290
their life, back into our job, I'm revealing too much anyway, so, but I think there's a moment where

209
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.020
we we've all done that, you know, and and and there's a moment in which we recognize that the only

210
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:44.040
thing that I can do right now is get is get all the way down and then there's something that Jesus

211
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:50.070
sees in the case that tells him he went all the way down and when he looks at him, he doesn't see a

212
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.620
man in a tree, he looks a man who went all the way down and the only thing he has to do now is get

213
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.320
out of that tree because he's got so much more than he needs to do in his life,

214
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:07.220
the case went to get a look, but but God already got the best look of his own heart and saw what

215
00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:17.860
needed to change and transform him all the way. But but unless we're willing to get down all the way

216
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:25.710
down, unless we're willing to really get low in the presence of God before Jesus, it's gonna be very

217
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:34.440
difficult for us to overcome. And so we've got to overcome ourselves. And and here's what we see in

218
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:40.480
this story is that he is a self made empty Nair. That's what I call them, by the way, don't call

219
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.880
them billionaires, I call them empty nares. And the reason they're empty nesters is because no

220
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:51.590
matter how much they acquire there is this study that's been done by psychologists over and over

221
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:57.650
again and then you can look it up and you see that the more you have, the more you want because the

222
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:04.650
emptier you feel and it doesn't matter how much you have, it doesn't matter how much your wealth may

223
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:11.760
go down because of whatever cryptocurrencies are doing or not doing, it doesn't matter how much your

224
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.270
wealth can change because well the real estate market is not what it was. And interest rates are

225
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:23.390
higher and well the cost of food is is it doesn't matter how many billions you lose and how you can

226
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:27.400
fall from number two to number three to maybe even out of the top 10

227
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:36.360
at the end of the day, God is asking, are you an empty Nair? Are you someone who feels that they are

228
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:44.720
so full that you have no place in your life for me because it doesn't matter what your bank account

229
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:54.210
says. Sometimes you walk around this world in this life like we are empty nares, We're full, but

230
00:37:54.210 --> 00:38:02.930
we're emptier than we ever could ever be. And we have deluded ourselves into thinking that what we

231
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.910
have acquired and what we have and what we possess and who we are and what we've done and what we're

232
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:18.450
holding onto whatever measure of that is that we have seen ourselves believe the lie and have lived

233
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:26.400
it out in its fullness every day. And there's something about the case that tells him this is not

234
00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:35.170
gonna be him anymore. The second thing we have to do is that we have to actually overcome others.

235
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:44.900
Now in this story, he has to overcome the people of this town. He's already the most - and I'm gonna

236
00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:55.430
put it this way - the most unwanted. He is on that town's number one position. There is no one in this

237
00:38:55.430 --> 00:39:04.510
town who is most unwanted other than Zacchaeus. He is number one. He's the wealthiest man in town, but he's

238
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:13.050
also the most unwanted man in town and he has to overcome that he not only has to overcome himself,

239
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:20.560
but he has to overcome the people of this town and sometimes like because you've got a job to do and

240
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.650
you're getting an income from that and you're becoming wealthy because of it. You stay where you are

241
00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.490
and you endure the hatred of the people because, well, you know that you deserve to be hated because

242
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:36.650
you're cheating them out of taxes and because you're working with the enemy and the Roman empire,

243
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:43.820
because you are a person who goes about taking from people what they would need to live and to live

244
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:52.180
better. And so as a result you are hated. But in this moment and in this time of his life, we see

245
00:39:52.180 --> 00:40:01.770
that nothing is stopping zoo chaos from getting away from this label and from this position in his

246
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:11.110
life to then go to Jesus. And if he doesn't overcome the crowd, if he doesn't overcome what they see,

247
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:18.690
if they doesn't overcome what they believe can never change. If he doesn't go past all of that, he

248
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:26.210
never experiences the breakthrough that God wants them to have. And many times in our lives, we

249
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:37.370
cannot get back together with people. For this very reason we think it's done. It's it's it's

250
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:47.700
finished. It's over. We're to unwanted. There's no way that they would ever take us back. And so we

251
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:54.700
move on because we think that's all we have. There's nothing else that we can do because in this

252
00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:04.830
situation people will never receive me. See me believe in me, trust me ever again. But what I have

253
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.980
understood in my own life is that if you stay,

254
00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.680
if you live out your faith

255
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.120
and you let the works speak for themselves

256
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:32.530
when the time comes where people are finally able to see something else and we're going to talk more

257
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:41.220
about that in a moment, because in verse seven, we know that the town hates him and even criticizes

258
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:47.890
Jesus for wanting to be with him. But then in verse eight, there's something that happens between

259
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:53.530
Jesus telling him to come down to go to his house to have a meal at the end of that meal, something

260
00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:01.080
amazing happens. And in verse eight, we see that he overcomes but he does it voluntarily and you

261
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:15.580
know what he overcomes. He overcomes his own life of getting in the way and taking what was not his.

262
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:26.770
And so he begins his path to restitution. And it's a restitution that is then meaning the past. And

263
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:34.440
then it's a restitution that is also now. Because he makes the decision, I'm gonna give half my

264
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:42.690
wealth to the poor - that's future. But he has to do something about the past and he says, I've

265
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:48.440
cheated people under taxes and there really shouldn't be an if in there, so we're gonna give him a

266
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:56.920
chance, okay? And and I will give them back because then he knows that he has and then he says, I'm

267
00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:05.460
gonna give them back four times as much. So what we do when we come to Jesus and have an encounter,

268
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:16.700
that is transformative, here's what we do. We only we only often only think about the future and we

269
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:25.650
only talk about the future. We don't talk about the past. We don't deal with the past. But you see

270
00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:32.920
the only way you can have a better future is if you deal with the past, if you don't deal with the

271
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:38.580
past, if you don't confront the past, if you don't make amends for the past, then here's what's

272
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:45.740
gonna happen, you will never have the future that God intended you to have. God wants you to have

273
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:53.360
the best future. But you can't have the best future until you deal with that past. And so in the

274
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:59.040
story, what we're finally seeing is that there is a restitution that is then and now. And it's

275
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:07.010
always bewildered me why he said four times the amount. But you know, the thing about the Bible is

276
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:13.670
that no words are wasted. Everything teaches and everything has a significance. And it turns out

277
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:21.240
that the first time this phrase four times was said was found in Second Samuel 12 6. Let's take a

278
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:32.290
look in Second Samuel in chapter 12. And in verse six, It says that so he must make restitution for

279
00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:45.110
the Lamb four times over since he did this thing and had no compassion because he did this thing and

280
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:55.200
had no compassion in this story. The Prophet Nathan comes to David and tells him a story of someone

281
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:04.950
who went and took someone else's sheep. And David gets so angry about the story. He says, then this

282
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:11.210
person needs to give back four times the amount that he took and then Nathan turns to David and he

283
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.020
says, David, you are that man

284
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:28.270
because David had taken someone else's wife. And so in that story, we see that that that this man is

285
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:36.910
a chaos, knew the story. We could see that there was something spiritual that had been sewn into his

286
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:43.840
life. And yet at some point in his life that had been forgotten had gone so far from him and so

287
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:50.690
beyond him. It was of no interest to him at all, that he began to just live life according to his

288
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:51.820
own principles.

289
00:45:53.860 --> 00:46:01.570
But in the moment that he makes a decision to bring about restitution to restore that which was

290
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:11.450
taken. It is in that moment that we see that he remembers the story of David And you know that in

291
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:18.930
the book of exodus and in the book of Leviticus and in the book of numbers and again in Deuteronomy,

292
00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:25.700
like over and over again, there's a different calculation that is often made and and sometimes it's

293
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:32.070
two times the amount. Sometimes it was five times the amount. Sometimes it was just 20% and

294
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:39.520
sometimes it was the equal amount that needed to be restored. But in this case he doesn't say, you

295
00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:46.630
know, it's going to be the equal amount. He just goes back to the original story the first time in a

296
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:59.450
way that it was said by someone that was now his spiritual king again. Do you see Jesus is in the

297
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:09.250
lineage of David, and so he speaks the words of King David, because he has now found a new king from

298
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:21.190
the house of David. Can we say Amen wow. So he doesn't quote the law. He quotes the king. Something

299
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:28.930
else, something else there, you see, he could have courted the law and there were a number of them

300
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:36.280
he could have quoted, but he quotes the king and he quotes the king at his lowest moment. He quotes

301
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.650
the king when, when he should not have been king, he quotes, he quotes the king who has a heart

302
00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.520
after God. But you know, he couldn't keep his pants on.

303
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.020
He quotes someone who was so broken in that moment

304
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:08.190
that now whenever someone speaks of Zacchaeus, they don't think of him as the most unwanted man. They

305
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:16.810
think of him as the one who gave back four times. Can we say amen to that? Because because here's

306
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:23.140
what we do, this is how we screw things up. Whenever we get to know Jesus, we go up to people and go,

307
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:32.150
I just found Jesus, let me tell you about Jesus. Listen to me as I tell you about the Jesus who

308
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:39.380
changed me and we go all over people and we just kill them all about Jesus and they're looking at us

309
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:41.720
remembering us like chaos.

310
00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:49.420
Because in that moment, you see God sees our faith,

311
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.980
but people just know our works

312
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:05.450
and there's gotta be a moment in which faith and works match up. You get that you get that because

313
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:11.380
what the case does is that he just doesn't talk a good game. You know, he just doesn't show

314
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:19.980
everybody that, that he is, you know, such an incredible person, an important because why else would

315
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.950
Jesus come to his house. Right?

316
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:36.160
But this is not about who he is. It isn't about what Jesus does for him, It is about what the case

317
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:36.690
does.

318
00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:45.360
It's about the restitution. Now, it's something about restitution that I need to share with you. And

319
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:53.310
it's, you know, it's, it's found actually in a book that you may never have read or heard or, but

320
00:49:53.310 --> 00:50:01.480
I've, as a pastor over the years have have helped a lot of people along the way and along the way,

321
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:08.070
I've met a lot of people who have, you know, been in a a or a form of it or gone to it and have been

322
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:15.700
able to quote it. And, and one of the parts in a is about making amends. It's about restitution and

323
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:21.950
in fact, I want to share with you in the book the a way it says that, um, I mean, hopefully you guys

324
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:27.820
can can see this and read this on the screen. It says in making amends, it is seldom wise to

325
00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:35.350
approach the individual who still smarts from our injustice to him and to announce that we have gone

326
00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:44.320
religious. I mean, this might be called leading with the chin widely ourselves open to being branded

327
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:51.410
fanatics or religious wars. If we do this, we may kill a future opportunity to carry a beneficial

328
00:50:51.410 --> 00:51:01.260
message. But the man who hears our amends is sure to be impressed with our sincere desire to set

329
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:11.240
right or wrong. And he is going to be more interested in a demonstration of goodwill than in talk of

330
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:21.010
spiritual discoveries. It's not what you say. It's what you do. And don't say it until your life can

331
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:21.820
back it up.

332
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:27.390
I mean, it's not scripture, but it's good.

333
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:40.120
And what we see in this story is that in a a there's steps to restitution. Step four is taken

334
00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:46.490
inventory. Step eight is you make a list of the people you've heard. And then Step nine is that you

335
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:56.910
make amends. That's what's being taught on on a weekly basis. And so when we think that this is an

336
00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:04.810
important, then we are denying all of the old testament. And we are denying what is confirmed in the

337
00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:12.340
presence of Jesus with Jesus, in the life of Zacchaeus when he makes restitution quoting the old

338
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:20.870
testament. And so if we are thinking I can just go forward with my life and leave my past behind and

339
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:24.790
never deal with it. We are wrong.

340
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:33.170
The past is just as important as our future.

341
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:47.500
And restitution is one of those things that we have to understand is a biblical path to freedom. Now,

342
00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:54.540
I want to tell you my reasons why restitution is good for you. Restitution is good for you because

343
00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:02.750
it shows that you are really sorry for what you did. Restitution is important because it makes it

344
00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:10.380
easier for the people that you've hurt to forgive you. Restitution is important because it makes you

345
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:17.040
much less likely to make the same mistake again because it's cost you something.

346
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:30.070
And so these are the reasons why restitution makes sense. It's what is found in actions and it's

347
00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:38.400
what is in the heart of God. When he gives the law concerning these things, it is what Jesus knew

348
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:47.180
what happened once. Zaki's came down and met with him once they shared a meal and he led him to a

349
00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:54.890
place of transformation. He knew that the KS would get to that place where voluntarily he would say

350
00:53:54.900 --> 00:54:03.450
this is what I am choosing to do. And God gave it to him. God showed him what he needed to say. And

351
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:12.630
then because he said those words, he said today, Jesus was then able to say today, today, Zacchaeus

352
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:21.040
is one of us. He's no longer the person he was. Today he's been changed. Today Zacchaeus has been

353
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:29.170
saved. Today. Today, he is a new creation. Today he gets a fresh start.

354
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:38.870
And he was able to say those things because the case said, I'm gonna give back four times what I

355
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:46.980
took. I want you to think about this because God sees your faith, but people always need to see your

356
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:53.180
works. And that's why James says, look, we can be in a place where we're always just thinking about

357
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.960
the works and we can do that. And then we don't have a relationship with God and we can get into a

358
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.560
place where we don't care about people, we don't care about works. We're just all about the

359
00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:07.710
relationship with God and the things that we're supposed to make right. We don't make right. And so

360
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:16.740
we can fall into one trap either. Either. One way we fail another way we fail. But when those two

361
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:26.510
things come together, when faith and good works come together, you have the winning combination to

362
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:35.600
bring about transformation. Because that's when we let our faith be backed up by the evidence of a

363
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:42.610
changed life. Can we say? Amen to that? We have the faith and we have to change life to prove it.

364
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:48.860
And so, I don't know what God's gonna ask you to do. I don't know where he's gonna ask you to go

365
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:53.940
back into your past. I don't know what kind of amends he's gonna ask you to make. I don't know what

366
00:55:53.940 --> 00:56:00.010
kind of restitution he's gonna put on your heart to do. But that's the beautiful thing because

367
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:07.270
whatever God puts on your heart to do do that, it's between you and him still. You see, I'm not

368
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:12.760
telling you four times, I'm not telling you to, I'm not telling you five, I'm not telling you 20%

369
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:18.250
I'm not even telling you that it has to be an equal amount. I don't know what it is, I know what

370
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:26.490
it's been in my life and I want you to discover what it is in yours because if you don't figure out

371
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:34.540
your past, you don't get a fresh start for your future. And God right now wants to give every one of

372
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:40.860
you that fresh start. Amen. Oh that was weak. I know this was gonna be a hard message, but I didn't

373
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:50.300
think it was gonna be that hard. Do you want a fresh start? Are you ready for a fresh start? Are you

374
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:56.730
ready to hear from God about what that is, what that looks like. It's okay if you're not right now,

375
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:04.010
don't keep living your life, like you can never get there because God that's where he's always

376
00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:04.880
leaving you

377
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.820
and you can't create a future. If you just keep reliving a different version of your past,

378
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:26.470
God's got something new for you and he says behold look, I've already done it, we just need to step

379
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:30.920
into it, we're ready for that. Amen God bless you guys, thank you so much.

380
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:43.480
I just want to invite you guys to stand and and to pray with me and uh and as I was speaking, I

381
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:48.140
noticed that we got Yvonne Masala is in the house.

382
00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:59.720
Oh man, it's so great to see you pastor even so pastor even worked here for like 15 years was like

383
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:03.980

384
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:11.560
pandemic, her timing was perfect and uh she uh is back visiting with us and we'll get a chance to

385
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.060
hear her speak in a few weeks. Isn't that awesome? And so

386
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:28.120
thanks Pastor Yvonne for being here. We love you and let's pray father, thank you for what you have

387
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:34.650
shown us today. You want us to have a fresh start. But there's some things that we need to do and I

388
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:42.090
pray that you would help us to do the good works that our faith is compelling us to do Lord, I thank

389
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:50.400
you for the freedom we have from our past for the deliverance you've given us from it, but we also

390
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:57.230
know Lord that there was a responsibility to it as well. And today we have heard that we know that

391
00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:04.400
and and you care about people, you care about every person that we've ever been in contact with just

392
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:11.380
as much as you care about us and and I pray that today would be a day where we can rejoice and be

393
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:21.340
renewed a day where we can truly be refreshed because you have given us a fresh understanding for a

394
00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:27.150
fresh start in Jesus name, we pray Amen Amen alright
