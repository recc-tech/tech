00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:51.260
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. River's edge. How is everybody today? Good. Welcome back.

8
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:58.940
We are so happy to share our Sunday with you. Whether you're here in person or online is just such a

9
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:06.640
blessing to be gathered together today. We're in our second week of a message series called Multiply.

10
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:13.270
And today we're going to hear about multiplying our talents. So I'm definitely here for this today.

11
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.710
I need to hear this today, so I'm very excited about that. So Pastor Lorenzo is going to be

12
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:26.130
discussing Jesus's parable of the talents. And so we hope that you're prepared for that today. Very

13
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:35.810
important part of our character here at River's Edge is that we accept everyone. We believe that you

14
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:43.920
belong before you believe. And this is the character of God. God accepts you where you are. It is

15
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:51.630
okay not to be okay. And we want people to come and feel accepted and loved and inspired and

16
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:58.610
encouraged. So this is a safe place for people. And we want that to be our character. Um, so we're

17
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:04.140
getting ready to worship with our wonderful worship team everybody please rise Let's worship

18
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.050
together Our first song today is heartbeat

19
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:21.380
Everyone, let's get into this worship. It's a beautiful song. Let's clap all together. And let's ask God

21
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.760
to show us his heart Hallelujah

83
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:06.690
Isn't that a powerful video? We give because we can we give because we were blessed first and we

84
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:15.150
want to be a blessing to others. I am I right. And so we at River's edge here are really encouraging

85
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:21.600
people that are coming regularly that are part of our community, that share our vision to become

86
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:29.820
ministry partners. With us. We have a vision here. We want to out reach beyond these doors into our

87
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:36.020
community. We want to touch the lives of our neighbors in Montreal and beyond because we can,

88
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:45.130
because we're blessed and we need your help to do that. And so we are asking for people to help and

89
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:53.510
to join us on a regular basis. Whatever God puts on your heart, to give us so that we can make these

90
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:59.780
visions come to life and to have you be a part of that with us, that is the community of faith that

91
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:06.940
we're building here. And so there are multiple ways that you can give. You can give online through

92
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:13.930
email transfer at the kiosks at the back by check. We've made it as easy as possible, but what's

93
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:20.360
most important is that you are inspired to be a part of the change that River's Edge wants to be in

94
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:26.590
our community and to do that on a regular basis so we can plan ahead. And there's some powerful

95
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:35.200
visions on the table that we can be a part of together. So we're asking for this Sincerely. Um, next

96
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:43.200
up, we have Father's Day coming next week, so we're going to celebrate all the Papa's in the house,

97
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:48.570
so please come out. There's going to be a photo booth. You can take photos with your family. We're

98
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.300
going to have ice cream from everybody at the back. It's going to be a celebration because fathers

99
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.950
are important and we cherish you. So we want to celebrate you next week.

100
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:09.160
Let's see Father's Day. Next up. We have the after party, so please don't run away after the service.

101
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.900
We want to know you. We want to know who you are, and we want you to know us. So at the back, we're

102
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:20.360
gonna have hot beverages and snacks for everybody. Please, we encourage you to come and speak to us.

103
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:28.130
We want to know who you are. Kids. You can be dismissed to the annex. And next we're going to be

104
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:33.670
hearing from Pastor Lorenzo. The message about the talents. Thank you.

106
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.150
Well, hey, everybody. So good to have you with us. So glad that you could be with us today in person

107
00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:02.130
and be able to celebrate this incredible opportunity that we have to just be able to gather and to

108
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:09.460
gather here before God. And one of the beautiful things about community is that we get to know each

109
00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:14.970
other a little bit better when we take that step across the room to say hi to someone to just

110
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:23.710
welcome them to just be there for them, for them to be able to feel welcomed by someone that they

111
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:30.690
haven't even met yet. And so I know you may not take it on as your responsibility to meet someone

112
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:38.860
you've. But I would ask that some of you would that if you are comfortable enough and that you are

113
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:44.990
courageous enough to see someone that you would just go over and say hi, especially if you see them

114
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:52.670
by themselves. That's a great opportunity to welcome someone who obviously came here alone today.

115
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:59.500
Well, we want you to understand the principles of multiplication and one of the beautiful things

116
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:05.630
about God's word is that it's so practical. It enables us to understand what it is that we need to

117
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:12.700
do each and every day so we can live a life of multiplication. One of the challenges that all of us

118
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:23.370
have is making the most out of what we've been entrusted with, what we have already not just pawning

119
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:32.740
and hoping and desiring and dreaming of what has yet to be brought to us, but to do something

120
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:39.820
amazing with what we already have now we may look at what we have, and and I'm sure that we're

121
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:48.310
grateful for it on some level on on the best days, we are grateful for it. On most days, we may

122
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:53.950
resent it. We may not find gratefulness in our minds or in our hearts for it because we want

123
00:29:53.950 --> 00:30:00.280
something more. We want something else. But what God is trying to show us is that what he's already

124
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:10.460
given us? What he's already entrusted us with is for multiplication. Now, when I think of

125
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:18.640
faithfulness, I think of a few words. Someone asks me Pastor, what is faithfulness? I say, You know,

126
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:27.220
faithfulness is about being loyal. It's about being committed. It's about being devoted. It's about

127
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:35.780
being trustworthy. It's about being a person who is able to be honest, no matter what the

128
00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:42.870
circumstances are. I think a person who is faithful is someone that you can always count on. They

129
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:53.500
are dependable. But when God defines faithfulness, he actually defines it differently. God's

130
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.170
definition of faithfulness is actually multiplication.

131
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:07.280
Now. It's not the word I would have chosen. It's not the word I would have selected is not the word

132
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:15.460
that I would have gone for when someone asked me, "Hey, describe faithfulness." But then I remember

133
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:21.010
that there was a time in which Jesus was walking with his disciples, and he walks up to this fig

134
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:26.880
tree and he discovers that there are no figs on it, and the Bible says that he actually curses the

135
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:34.280
tree. Now the thing is that Jesus was actually cursing something that already wasn't fruitful for.

136
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:40.850
So put it in context that this tree that was supposed to bear fruit that was supposed to give figs

137
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:50.190
already was not doing and fulfilling its purpose. Keep in mind that this tree that was supposed to

138
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:58.450
have fruit in season didn't have any, which meant that it wasn't fruitful and therefore it wasn't

139
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:07.800
multiplying. And so what Jesus does is that he curses it and the tree withers and dies out

140
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:16.170
completely. And and in the Bible, we understand that the fig tree is actually the nation of Israel

141
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:26.480
and how it was entrusted to be able to bear fruit and to multiply itself among the nations. But it

142
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:33.200
wasn't doing that. And so when Jesus walks up to this tree, he's also condemning the way that

143
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:41.230
religion had worked up until that point, how the temple had failed and its temple servants had

144
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:49.390
failed the people, how it had not realized its potential and how we had not done what God had

145
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:58.460
instructed them to do. And so now they're not bearing any fruit. And so Jesus highlights this by

146
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:05.090
what he does, and in the passage that we're about to read on two different occasions, both in

147
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:13.790
Matthew and in Luke. The last verse is really hard because it talks about how there's weeping and

148
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:22.430
gnashing of teeth for anyone who isn't fruitful for someone who isn't able to take what God has

149
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:32.550
given them and entrusted them and do something with it in their lifetime. And so that message is

150
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:40.130
important to keep in mind when we think of what a faithfulness look like. Well, God says it looks

151
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:50.660
like this. The definition of faithful equals multiplication. And when you think of multiplication,

152
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:58.590
what are you thinking about? In terms of seeing multiplied? Well, the Bible talks about this parable

153
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:07.270
that Jesus gives, and he speaks of it in terms of talents. Silver, let's say, its wealth, its

154
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:14.880
possessions. Now we've understood that to go beyond just wealth we go and understand in our minds

155
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.970
and in our everyday application. That, of course, we're talking about gifts, abilities, things that

156
00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:29.210
uniquely have formed us and shaped us that give us an ability in this life to make a difference in

157
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:36.530
our spheres of influence. And whatever our sphere of influence is that we can have impact there,

158
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:44.670
that God is looking for multiplication in those areas in those spheres of influence. And so when

159
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:54.850
he's saying, I want you to be a faithful disciple, he's asking us, Are you multiplying in your

160
00:34:54.850 --> 00:35:02.730
sphere of influence? But he's also asking us, what have we done with what we've been entrusted with

161
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:11.510
with what I've already put in your hands. So the story begins in Luke 19. Let's take a look. I like

162
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:18.270
this version of the story that Jesus gives. Uh, the Matthew One is the one that we're most familiar

163
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:24.360
with, but there's principles of multiplication in the story that is found in Luke, 19, that are not

164
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:30.890
found in Matthew 23. And so I want us to look at this passage instead. And in verse 11. It says that

165
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:39.090
they have heard these things, he added, and he spake a parable because he was nigh to Jerusalem and

166
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:47.170
because they thought that the Kingdom of God should immediately appear. Let's go to the next one.

167
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.880
We'll just keep going through them and read it all the way through. He said, Therefore, a certain

168
00:35:51.880 --> 00:36:00.320
nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and then he was to return. And

169
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:07.740
then he called his 10 servants, and he delivered them £10 and he said unto them, Occupy till I come.

170
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:15.090
But his citizens hated him, and they sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to

171
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:23.330
reign over us and it came to pass that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he

172
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:29.960
commanded these servants to be called upon him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know

173
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:37.990
how much every man had gained by trading. And then came the first saying, Lord, thy pound have

174
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.420
gained 10 pounds. And then he said onto him Well, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a

175
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:53.480
very little have thou authority over 10 cities. And then the second came saying, Lord, thy pound

176
00:36:53.480 --> 00:37:01.720
have gained £5 and he said, likewise to him Be thou also over five cities and another came saying,

177
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:10.730
Lord behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin. And for I feared the because

178
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:20.970
thou art an austere man. Thou takest up that thou layest not down and you reap that which you did

179
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:29.750
not. So and he said unto him, out of thine own mouth, will I judge the that we could servant though

180
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:37.150
you noticed that I was an Oster man taking up that I laid not down and reaping that I did not. So

181
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:45.950
wherefore then gave us that my money into the bank that at my coming, I might have required mine own

182
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:53.450
with usury. And he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him That hath

183
00:37:53.830 --> 00:38:04.300
10 pounds. And they said Unto him, Lord, he had 10 pounds. And the Lord says that onto everyone which hath

184
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:12.040
shall be given and then from him, that have not even that that he hath shall be taken away from him.

185
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:20.190
Now, You guys messed me up because that was supposed to be N l t. And we just read the King James

186
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:32.120
version. So I'm sweating up here, man, like, Yeah, I don't know what happened, but you guys really

187
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:48.550
got me good. I just I just like I feel like I'm not dressed for that language. Oh, okay. Well, since

188
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:58.640
nobody understood what we read, let me just summarize what the heck just happened. I don't know, uh,

189
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.740
but we are talking about

190
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:11.550
what I think is really important in terms of understanding how Jesus is and the story sounds like

191
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.840
everyone thinks well, they don't just think it. They believe it. That he's that he's an Oscar, man.

192
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:26.300
which means that he is harsh. Man, that is tough. That is difficult that he's not someone that you

193
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:33.490
want to disappoint. And I don't know about you, but I grew up with that mindset. You know, there

194
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:38.240
were times when I was a kid. I grew up. I woke up from a nap and and there was nobody in the house.

195
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.640
And I thought Jesus had come back and left me behind.

196
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:49.460
I was, like, certain? Because I had been told that if I wasn't a good kid, that that I would be left

197
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:55.940
behind that that he wouldn't take me to be with him in heaven forever. And I remember stories like

198
00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.140
that thinking, Well, this is the Jesus that these servants think they're serving.

199
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:09.500
And what Jesus went and did is that he went away. And then he entrusted them with something. And

200
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:18.750
what God is doing here is that he's saying this is how you view me. This is how you see me. You

201
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:25.380
don't understand me. You don't understand what I'm here to do. You think that I want you to fail?

202
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:32.650
You think that I'm harsh and so you would rather bury than invest But I want you to understand

203
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:38.130
that's a mistake. Because whatever I give you, it's because I want to see you prosper with it.

204
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:47.420
That Jesus gave them all something. But not everyone was able to produce. And in this story, the

205
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:55.680
person who takes the one and turns it into 10 God multiplies it to the point where he gives him 10

206
00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:05.710
cities to govern. Think about that. He doesn't just say I'm gonna do a little addition here.

207
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:14.510
But you took 1 pound. You turned it into 10. And now what I'm gonna show you Is that I'm going to give

208
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:19.530
you 10 cities to rule over because I am a ruler of kingdoms.

209
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:28.580
And so Jesus, saying if I rule over kingdoms, then why are you settling for what you can wrap in a

210
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.130
napkin?

211
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:41.140
Why are you afraid to lose that little bit you've got you think? But this is everything.

212
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:50.980
You don't see how God is actually with you. And you don't see how much he's already given to you.

213
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:57.420
You don't even understand that the whole point of him giving it to you is so that it multiplies not

214
00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:06.250
so that you wrap it in a napkin because you're afraid of what would come next. And I know that many

215
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:12.680
of us have lived in that fear for good reason. I'm sure if I asked this room if you if you felt you

216
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:19.290
had trauma in your life, put up your hand. If you felt like you had a traumatic childhood, put up

217
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:25.590
your hand. If you felt like you have lived in poverty or experiencing poverty, you say lift up your

218
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:34.120
hand. I'm sure all of us could do that. I could share stories of my own life of what that looks like.

219
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:46.100
I can tell you over and over again how tough it's been in my life, and I still wouldn't maybe come

220
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:53.220
close to the tough things that you've gone through. But they were tough for me. Traumatic for me.

221
00:42:53.220 --> 00:43:00.380
They've shaped me just having a conversation last night. My wife's childhood was traumatic to the

222
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:06.900
point that has shaped her as an adult and how she views this world. And I was thinking about how my

223
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:16.050
own life and how it shaped my view and my understanding of of what life can be like when you're

224
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:26.190
trying to live a life that is faithful and a life that multiplies. And it's hard to sometimes merge

225
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:32.720
those two worlds because of how I've lived because of what I've gone through. And I'm sure it's

226
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:38.180
difficult for you as well in the same way that you look at the things that you've been through, the

227
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:46.620
things that you've gone and are going through, that it's difficult to believe in a God who

228
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:57.230
multiplies in the way that he is saying that he does In Matthew 25 23. And Don't punk me now,

229
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:06.320
the master said. Well done. Thank you, my good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in

230
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:15.820
handling this small amount. So now I will give you Look at this many more responsibilities. Let's

231
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:24.210
celebrate together. What is what is God's intention in this? He's saying through Jesus that there

232
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:31.030
are three key things that he really wants us to get. The first thing is that Jesus cares about the

233
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:40.190
multiplication and he cares about the methods and he cares about the motivation. And what he's

234
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:49.310
saying is that I want you to understand what it looks like for you to have multiplication in your

235
00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:59.990
life. I want you to have this. So that's why he says, that the servant is faithful. And then he says

236
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:11.430
that that servant is good. And then he makes it clear that that servant has been a servant who has

237
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:22.120
been faithful to the end, and his motivation was all about making sure that he pleased Jesus. And if

238
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:29.300
if if you look at how multiplication works in your life, you can always look at these three things

239
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:41.040
Number one and my thinking multiplication in the story. It's £1 that becomes 10. It's £5. That

240
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:48.370
then turns into governing five cities, £10 that's governing 10 cities. It's a multiplication in

241
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:58.170
Matthew, it's too talents and all of its those talents that then become four. And then it's five

242
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:06.200
that become 10, and the idea is always multiplication. It doesn't matter what the numbers are. What

243
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:15.300
matters is that you're thinking multiplication. And so when you live a life that is faithful, God is

244
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:22.210
saying you can expect multiplication. How many of us go through life thinking multiplication? Not

245
00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:29.100
many. I don't think I understood this early enough. I didn't I didn't get what the story was really

246
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:37.810
about. I didn't understand that multiplication was how I needed to have my mindset all the time that

247
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:46.120
whatever God had already given me his attention was multiplication. If I get that, then I live like

248
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:52.570
that every day. I look at what I have the little bit that it is. I look at my paycheck. I look at

249
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:59.010
the home that I live in. I look at whatever it is that I've got and I say, God, this is what you

250
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:07.500
have entrusted me with. But now you are saying this is going to be about multiplication. Why? How?

251
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.680
Like what? Why do I need something more than this? Sometimes you have to ask yourself that question.

252
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:23.240
Maybe it isn't about increasing your level of living. It is about increasing your capacity for

253
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.710
giving.

254
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:33.080
What if What if God is saying I'm giving you more so that you can do more? You can make a greater

255
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.900
difference

256
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:46.400
so you can go beyond your own sphere of life and living and begin to see how God is multiplying

257
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:55.620
things in your life so you can impact other spheres that go outside of your own life and the way

258
00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:02.760
that you live. And now all of a sudden we begin to understand that God isn't just about

259
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.290
multiplication. He's also about the motivation.

260
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:20.320
What is motivating you to experience multiplication? Are you saying God and trust me more? You gave

261
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:30.050
me a pound and I turned it into 10. And now you've given me governorship over 10 cities. That means

262
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:37.030
you believe that I have the capacity to do that. Now you're gonna govern a city that means you

263
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:43.800
become a servant of 10 cities. It means that you are there to impact the lives of hundreds of

264
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:56.390
thousands of people. If each city on average, was about 100,000 People, it meant that £1 turned

265
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.090
into impacting one million lives.

266
00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:08.280
And God is saying it wasn't just about what you did with the pound. But it's what I knew you could

267
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.290
do with the million.

268
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:14.690
It was how you were gonna touch all those lives.

269
00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:24.680
It was about what you were going to be able to do to make a difference outside of your own life and

270
00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:31.970
impacting the lives of others. And so when God looks at us, he says you have the capacity not just

271
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:39.750
for one, you have the capacity for a million. Can we say amen to that? I mean, that's the way he

272
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:50.650
sees you. I don't see myself like that. I gotta tell myself that Jesus sees me like that. I have to

273
00:49:50.650 --> 00:50:01.090
believe that he sees me like that. I have to trust him that I can handle that, that he is leading me

274
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:09.920
to that, that everything that he's giving me is so that I can impact the million. And so when you

275
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:16.300
look at your life, if you don't see yourself the way that Jesus does, this is why we need the mind

276
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:24.800
of Christ. The mind of Christ means you take the teachings of Jesus and you believe in those more

277
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:33.540
than your own mind and what it's telling you. I will look to the teachings of Jesus over what the

278
00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:43.080
darkness of my mind can conceive. I will look to the teachings of Jesus and trust that over any

279
00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:50.790
darkness that would permeate in my own thoughts that would cause me to believe that I am less than

280
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:59.180
faithful and incapable of multiplication. I will move out of that darkness and into the light, and I

281
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:06.330
will think the thoughts that Jesus thinks and his teaching will be applied in my life to combat that

282
00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:17.790
darkness. So I will not be deceived by my thoughts and not be led by my Brokenness and not be kept

283
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:23.080
down by the opinions of others who judge and condemn.

284
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:33.190
When Jesus looks at you, he sees someone who is capable of a million.

285
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.080
Let that just sink in for a moment.

286
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:52.280
and then think about how you can now become a multiplier by being faithful.

287
00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:01.850
I don't always understand. You know how Jesus is at work in my life. And there are times when I

288
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:09.640
think he's harsh at times when I thought that God has, like, been too hard on me like this was a

289
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.280
moment that he could have blessed me that he could have, I don't know, just opened my eyes to see,

290
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:22.220
like, just help me to not walk into the into the pit that I was falling into. There was a moment

291
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:28.110
there where I thought, you know, like, why? Why do you let the loved ones in my life die of cancer?

292
00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:37.680
Like why? Why'd you take my father at 64 when he finally was giving his life back to Jesus. I didn't

293
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:43.880
have enough years with him that I could have experienced what it meant to have a spiritual father.

294
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:50.940
Why? Why did those things happened in the time that it happened? It was hard to understand that

295
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:56.270
because I really prayed for something different. I prayed for an outcome that didn't turn out.

296
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:05.560
I saw so many things that kind of just perplexed me and hurt me and and made me question the love

297
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:12.330
that God had not only for me, but for the people in my community of faith where where we labored and

298
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:18.850
prayed and believed and and and wept and cried out to God. And it still didn't go the way that we

299
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:25.980
thought it could and that we believed it would. Don't tell me I'm alone in that.

300
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:33.750
So when those when those servants look and they say that God is a tough god and that Jesus was a

301
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:40.450
tough master and that they wanted to sometimes just wrap up what they have in a napkin and just like

302
00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:46.110
call it a day don't tell me you've never retreated. Don't tell me you've never hit. Don't tell me.

303
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:52.270
You never stood back. Don't tell me you never step back. Don't tell me you never stayed away. Don't

304
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:58.660
tell me you never walked away. Don't tell me you never did any of that Because you did. I did. And

305
00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:04.190
every time I did one of those stupid things. Every time I did one of those things that demonstrated

306
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:10.650
my unfaithfulness. I missed out on the million. Do you get that? So So what the teaching does is

307
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:15.360
that it brings us back to a place where we look back on our life. And we say I may not have

308
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.260
understood it. I may not have gotten it. It may have felt too harsh. It may have felt too hard. It

309
00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:24.820
may have felt like your love was absent. It may have felt like you weren't there for me, but at the

310
00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.860
end of the day, I will remain faithful to you.

311
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:35.930
And when I remain faithful to you, whatever you have given me, I will believe that the one will turn

312
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:44.720
to 10. That the 10 will turn into a million. Because that's who you are. That's what you do. And

313
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:53.060
even if I don't see it in my life right now. I'm gonna believe in you for it. I am going to trust

314
00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:53.360
you.

315
00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:04.320
It's hard to go there. It's hard to be there. But you all have to talk to yourselves towards it. You

316
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:12.100
gotta self talk. You've got to turn to the scriptures. When you don't want to talk to yourself, let

317
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:19.830
God's word speak to you instead. When you can't do it on your own, you know that you can turn to

318
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:28.280
someone who's also in the faith and you can ask them. Remind me why I need to be faithful. Remind me

319
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:36.940
of a god who multiplies because right now I'm struggling with this right now. I feel defeated by

320
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:45.150
this right now. My heart is so dark. My mind is so caught up in the pain and the trauma and the

321
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:51.690
tragedy of what I'm living, that I cannot be faithful in this moment. I just want to kick it all to

322
00:55:51.690 --> 00:56:01.560
the curb and walk away. I need your help. And so we turn to the community. We turn to others who are

323
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:09.380
following Jesus, who, even in their own moment of weakness as they speak their truth, which is God's

324
00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:14.950
truth with which is the truth of Jesus Christ, which is his teaching. They're gonna encourage

325
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:20.550
themselves as they teach you. Has it ever happened to you that you were down? You're discouraged.

326
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.320
Someone came to you and said, I don't believe in God anymore. I'm, like, struggling and something

327
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:30.050
fired up inside you and said, Hold on a second. No. Let me tell you about why you should believe.

328
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:36.800
Let me tell you about why you can't be faithful. Why you can experience multiplication. And then all

329
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:41.550
of a sudden, as you were doing the teaching to encourage this person all along, you were just

330
00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:49.680
encouraging yourself. You were building yourself up while you were teaching someone else because

331
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:58.020
that's the way the word of God works. My faith gets built up by teaching the word of God. It isn't

332
00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:04.030
just by hearing the word of God, but then it is by sharing the word of God. And you need to

333
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:10.630
understand that for yourself. It isn't about what you learn, but it's also about what you transfer

334
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:19.640
to others. It's about what you are able to share multiplication and the story that we're in. I want

335
00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:32.860
you to know this. It's important. It is as a result of our work. God is saying you need to be put to

336
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:42.160
work. You need to be put to work. You need to work, you need to do the work. And when you do the

337
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:51.720
work, I'm multiplying. I multiply it. Even when he put Adam and Eve in a perfect garden, he put them

338
00:57:51.720 --> 00:58:01.230
to work even before the fall They had to work and God multiplied. It doesn't matter the context. You

339
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:09.330
have to work. The work will be blessed. What you put into it. You are going to see God multiply it

340
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:17.440
if I sit back and just wait for God to change it Jod to transform it got to somehow change my mind

341
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:23.920
and my heart without doing any work. I'm not going to see the multiplication. So God is saying I

342
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:29.680
want you to know that multiplication is going to be a product of your work. The next thing he tells

343
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:37.090
us in this passage is that God gives what we need to multiply everything that we need to see

344
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:44.380
Multiplied. He's already given it. Now all we need to understand is the measure. What is the amount.

345
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:50.880
What have you entrusted me with? And so, Lord, whatever you've given me right now, what I have right

346
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:58.480
now, right now not what I will have not what I did have. I can't do anything about what I used to

347
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:08.890
have. And I can't base this on what I hope I have. I gotta start with what I have. Right now, what

348
00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:15.650
you have. Do you believe that God can multiply that your mind is telling you all kinds of crazy

349
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:23.300
stuff. Right now, your heart is telling you that you can stay angry at God because of this. But you

350
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:29.720
need to understand that right now. God has already given you what you need to see. It multiplied.

351
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:39.830
That's how it works each day. God comes and gives you what you need. Each day. He's asking you trust

352
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:49.880
me to multiply. Can we say amen to that? Yeah. The next thing is, we multiply what we can handle Now.

353
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:57.390
Not everybody got 10. And the talents Not everybody got one. Not everybody got to. Not everybody got

354
00:59:57.390 --> 01:00:04.170
five. Does that make sense? So right now I know that I can only handle this. And there were times in

355
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:11.410
my life where God gave me this but said, I want you to be faithful with this. And then he interested

356
01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:16.900
me with more. Does that make sense? So you don't get upset about what you're starting off with,

357
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:23.480
because God's intention is just to give you success. He's just giving you what you can handle right

358
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:28.970
now. And so maybe right now what you can handle is one. Maybe it's two. Maybe it's five, But you're

359
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:35.280
gonna get to the point where God gives you 10 and 10 becomes a million. Can we say amen to that? But

360
01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:42.500
right now you've got to trust him for what he has already given you. The next thing is, we work and

361
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:49.620
we are accountable to only one person. Now there's a lot of responsibilities, a lot of roles we got

362
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:56.740
to fulfill. But if you make yourself accountable to Jesus more than anybody else, guess what

363
01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:00.940
everyone else is gonna be super impressed with you.

364
01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:09.630
But if you try to impress the people around you and the last person you think about is Jesus, then

365
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:16.870
this is what's gonna happen. Your multiplication is gonna turn into division. Your motivation is

366
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:23.320
gonna be directed by things of this world and not by the heart of God. And your methods are going to

367
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.830
look like everyone else's instead of the principles that Jesus has taught us.

368
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:37.710
And so if you make yourself accountable and responsible to Jesus, then all of a sudden now you're

369
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:43.310
gonna go from faithful to multiplication because you're not going to be motivated by whatever else

370
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.490
is motivated by you're not gonna be led and taught by the standard that everybody else is saying is

371
01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:55.690
Okay, we can do this. We can do that. We can do this, We can do more of that. It's okay to do it

372
01:01:55.690 --> 01:02:03.960
this way. You're gonna say no. Jesus has taught that I can't that there is a better way. There is a

373
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.320
higher way. Jesus has made it clear that I can't do this, that I can't do this like everybody else,

374
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:16.340
that I can't live by this standard. He's made it clear to me and to my heart that even though I'm

375
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:23.410
not ready to live like this and do these things, this is what I know. He's taught it, and I'm gonna

376
01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:24.920
let that be my guide

377
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.490
two more things.

378
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:35.510
The unfaithful one just wasted his opportunity.

379
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:47.720
And I have. I feel in my life I've wasted opportunities. Anybody else. Like the opportunity was there,

380
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:56.800
I just missed it or the opportunity was there. I had it in my hands and I wasted it. I could have

381
01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:05.000
experienced a different life, a different outcome. But I'm here now. I wasted that opportunity, and

382
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.230
sometimes when we waste opportunities, we sometimes tie that in to the age that we are in life,

383
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:22.250
right? Like when we're Wasting opportunities, when you're, you know 16, you feel like that's what

384
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:29.560
you're supposed to do, waste opportunities. You feel like that's that's actually like, you know,

385
01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:30.810
living a fun life.

386
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:39.620
Am I wrong? I felt like when I was wasting opportunities. There were, like, some of the best days of

387
01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:47.610
my life when I was young. I'll be honest with you. But now when I look back, I see that that wasn't

388
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:53.980
the case. My perspective changed. My understanding of life changed. And as you get older, you start

389
01:03:53.980 --> 01:04:01.250
to feel like I don't have many more opportunities. Have you ever said those words? Have you ever

390
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:08.460
believed that in your heart. Look at all the old people, God using the Bible. Come on, wake up. It's

391
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:16.260
never true, man. It's a lie. It doesn't matter your age. What matters is that faithfulness leads to

392
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:22.650
multiplication. That took some of the oldest people in the Bible who had no hope. And he used them

393
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:29.860
greatly. People who everyone else had given up on themselves included, and God turned them into

394
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:36.600
heroes of the faith has nothing to do with age. Has everything to do with not letting the

395
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:43.160
opportunity stay wasted. Can we say amen to that? The reason this person has talked about of having

396
01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:51.720
wasted the opportunity is so that we don't do that so that we don't end up like them. That's it.

397
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:59.730
Hey, we're gonna have a few more weeks of this. I'm gonna stop my teaching here. Thank you for your

398
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:07.220
attention. There's a lot more I want to say, but I'm sure your butts are sweaty. So we're gonna stop.

399
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:17.960
Let's just stand for a moment and and and just give ourselves a break here. And if I could just wrap

400
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.870
it up with one last thing

401
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:30.220
so we can all be encouraged, it's what's on the screen right now. Let us be faithful and multiply.

402
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:38.670
Does anybody else want to go in on me with this? Anybody else? Honestly, like, Are you ready? Are

403
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:47.080
you ready to be faithful and to see multiplication? Let's let's stop wrapping our lives in stupid

404
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:54.810
napkins. Come on, man. Come on. It's enough. That's enough. Let's stop wasting our opportunities.

405
01:05:55.590 --> 01:06:02.490
God's got so much more for us. So much more. And we got to believe that we got to live that. And if

406
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:09.730
it comes from a place of faithfulness, it means that today we make a decision to believe in

407
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:16.400
multiplication. We're gonna ask God to change our methods, and we're gonna ask him to transform our

408
01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:23.420
motivation. Amen. Father, thank you for every person here for every life that is watching for

409
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:31.380
everything that you have done that you are doing that you are bringing to life. You've done some

410
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.700
work today, Lord, that you have taken dead things and you've brought them back to life for us.

411
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:45.670
You've chosen us, and you have encouraged us to realize powerful things. Today I pray Lord, that we

412
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:53.410
would lead and leave and live from that place of power.

413
01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:05.190
I want us God to lead others and to lead ourselves. Well, I want us, God to leave those things that

414
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:14.230
hold us back. But then leave your throne empowered to make a difference in this world. And I want us

415
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:22.990
to live no longer just for ourselves. But for every sphere of influence that you have placed us in

416
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:33.680
so that we can see multiplication happen. And I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You guys good.

417
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.750
We're good. Amen.

418
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:43.590
And miraculously, as I was praying, the band appeared behind me. And so now we're gonna sing one

419
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:50.410
more song. That song is a beautiful song that's called Miracle And we sang it earlier. And I

420
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:57.640
honestly love the words of this song because it speaks to all of us about how God is still the God

421
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:04.240
of miracles for each of us. And I want you as you sing these songs and maybe even as you just

422
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:11.730
reflect on the words, even if you just listen to what the band is just doing up here, that you would

423
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:17.560
turn these words into your prayer. Can you do that? And you can solidify the work that God has

424
01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.000
already been doing in our hearts this entire time and that we could leave this place empowered

425
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:29.700
knowing that, well, there's greater things to come. Do you believe that for yourself? Amen. I do too.

426
01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:35.040
God bless you. Let's do this. And I'll see you guys after the service. Right here. Okay. Amen.

455
01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:54.080
God of miracles. We hope that today blessed you um, and that this message touched your hearts. It's

456
01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:00.150
certainly blessed me today. God sees our potential, our capacity. And he can do miraculous things

457
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:08.760
with what we have and where we are right now. And that is amazing. Right? Um thank you again for
