00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:13.519
Good morning River's Edge. How are you this morning? Good. Yeah, beautiful Sunday. Finally, that's amazing. After

2
00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:21.529
a week of rain, I thought God came back on his promises to never flood the earth again. Uh With

3
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:30.329
that five days in a row of raining and uh but today's is uh today. In fact, uh Friday was a good day

4
00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:37.380
with no rain finally. So really happy uh to enjoy some good time here. So I really want you to wish,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:45.690
I really want me to wish you, you wish me the wow, warm welcome guys. I really warmly welcome you

6
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:56.549

7
00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:02.369
you through the summer, but it's going to be even warmer in here. So it will be double warm welcome.

8
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.549
Ok. So as we will move through the summer, that building will be hotter and hotter with hot people

9
00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:16.359
and us and being able to wish us all of us warm welcome each Sunday after Sunday. So let's prepare

12
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:40.070

17
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:18.489

18
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.799
the activities going on in your life. And I guess it's probably the same thing for me and you that

19
00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:30.760
there's plenty of things going in your head right now, thinking about whatever thing you're thinking

20
00:08:30.769 --> 00:08:36.299
right now. Is there a lot of like thoughts trained thoughts in your head going on right now? Yes.

21
00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:42.409
Why kind of some people? Perfect. So for the other who don't have that, I really enjoy your peace.

22
00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.679
And uh I want some trick about that, but for the worship time that we will have together, it's a

23
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:57.500
wonderful opportunity to just breath, take a minute and really focus our thought on the one that has

24
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:04.549
created the earth and everything around us and just think about him and no matter where you are in

25
00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:10.729
your spiritual journey. It's an opportunity to think about these things, to think a little bit about

26
00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:16.909
faith, love and hope. And that's really what I wish for all of us, for this wonderful time of

27
00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:23.590
worship. So can we stand all together and welcome warmly, our worship team? Thank you.

29
00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:36.090

138
00:25:44.699 --> 00:25:52.449
you just have to take a quick look and be able to share your faith with kids. So if you are tempted

00:25:52.459 --> 00:26:02.119
by that position and you want to uh we uh you can mention that to Talita who is responsible of the

time, you believe in what we doing and you want to support that and you want to share the cost of

158
00:28:01.245 --> 00:28:07.515
that community. Obviously, we will welcome uh your donation and we want to thank you for those who

159
00:28:07.526 --> 00:28:13.105
are doing that regularly. We really appreciate that. And as we will enter in the summer also, please

160
00:28:13.115 --> 00:28:20.526
consider some regular donation. That's always a good thing because the our expense, there's a really

161
00:28:20.612 --> 00:28:24.501
just take a minute to explain to you that that's wonderful. I don't know if it's that in your

162
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:32.222
personal situation, but expense are linear. OK? They're always there. OK? The expense are always is

163
00:28:32.232 --> 00:28:39.781
there. And for us as uh as probably employee uh when you're you as an employee, we have regular

164
00:28:39.791 --> 00:28:47.052
revenue. So that's good regular expense, regular revenue. And then some situation when you're uh an

165
00:28:47.062 --> 00:28:54.770
entrepreneur, regular expense, irregular revenue. So that's giving palpitations cardiaques. So heart

166
00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:06.880
palpitation uh If you want more heart palpitation, you are on a church board. Ok. Regular expense.

167
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:13.719
Totally irregular revenue. Ok. Yolanda can testify about that. Our director of Finance and

168
00:29:13.729 --> 00:29:16.020
Administration give a clap for Yolanda

169
00:29:18.349 --> 00:29:29.280

171
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:42.349

172
00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:49.479
welcome uh with me, our pastor Lorenzo for uh our new series, unlocking new level of peace.

173
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:12.349
Hey, before we get started with the series and today's message, um, I wanted to just take a moment

174
00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:20.599
to just, uh, thank and appreciate, um Miranda Moses and, uh, and, and Drew Door because of their

175
00:30:20.609 --> 00:30:29.689
work in our, uh, daycare next door, which we use on Sundays. Uh, it's something that we greatly

176
00:30:29.699 --> 00:30:39.459
benefit from and, uh, we currently have, uh, 57 kids enrolled. Uh We are looking to expand that to

177
00:30:39.469 --> 00:30:46.109
67 kids in the next few months with a new nursery that's gonna be opening to meet the demand in our

178
00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:54.680
community. And our permit is for 74 kids. And so it's, it's an incredible uh ministry that we have

179
00:30:54.689 --> 00:31:04.050
there. Uh We get to employ uh 11 people and at the same time, we get to benefit um by the daycare,

180
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:12.099
paying rent and by also us being able to have an incredible facility that we can use for our kids

181
00:31:12.109 --> 00:31:19.780
ministry programs. But it's also our heart and our desire to employ um more believers that can work

182
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:24.939
in that day care to have an impact, not only on the lives of those Children, but on the parents

183
00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:31.170
themselves and to see this community just grow and expand and its influence in this community. And a

184
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:38.439
big part of that were um have, have been, you know, Drew Miranda and of course, Maureen, who have

185
00:31:38.449 --> 00:31:46.579
been with me and my wife and making this possible over the last several years. And uh we recently um

186
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:55.430
hired uh Thalita to be the daycare director and it's just again, just taken us to a new level. And

187
00:31:55.439 --> 00:32:00.969
so I just want to acknowledge our board of directors for the daycare because now Drew and Miranda

188
00:32:00.979 --> 00:32:07.140
are going to be stepping down. Maureen is gonna continue uh to serve on the board and we're going to

189
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:13.089
be adding a couple of new uh board members in the next little while. But I wanted to just ask uh for

190
00:32:13.099 --> 00:32:20.270
Miranda, you stand first so everyone could see who you are. Miranda up. Thank you. That's Miranda.

191
00:32:24.439 --> 00:32:32.130
And I just want to say like Miranda, like you, you went above and beyond. You didn't just, you know,

192
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:39.250
help us as in overseeing it, but you, you literally were involved in the day to day when you needed

193
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:48.510
to and you did more than anyone uh any one of us on that day care board. And um and I just want to

194
00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.099
say from the bottom of my heart in recognition of your hard work and in front of this community of

195
00:32:53.109 --> 00:33:02.160
faith that you just, we cannot just repay you enough for what you've done. But I know that God is

196
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:07.459
going to bless you in ways that I could never bless you. But I feel like a small thing that we can

197
00:33:07.469 --> 00:33:13.099
do is just at least recognize you and everything that you've done can we just thank you, Miranda

198
00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:13.479
again.

199
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:27.290
And uh and then I'm going to ask Drew to stand as well and that's Drew. So thank you, Drew. Thank

200
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:34.000
you. And uh and Maureen would you stand? Thank you, Maureen. You're awesome.

201
00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:43.530
We so appreciate you guys. What a, what a blessed team we have here at River's Edge. Such incredible

202
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:50.150
people who serve behind the scenes and make things um just so possible each and every week. Well, I

203
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.689
want to speak to you today about trauma and it, and it goes perfectly in line with what it looks

204
00:33:55.699 --> 00:34:02.339
like sometimes to serve on a board at Rivers Edge uh because sometimes it can be traumatic,

205
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.399
but we are going to be talking about unlocking new levels of peace and how we can experience peace

206
00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:17.879
of mind. But through purpose and I know that we all have at some point gone through something

207
00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:24.628
traumatic and sometimes we can block that out and sometimes while we, there's nothing that we can do

208
00:34:24.638 --> 00:34:30.760
that can block it out. And no matter how hard we try, there's just no way of living life in the day

209
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:37.149
to day without being reminded of what we've gone through. And I know that when it comes to trauma,

210
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.120
it is such a,

211
00:34:40.138 --> 00:34:47.080
a difficult topic. And I can't say that I am qualified to speak on this, but I believe that the

212
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:54.110
scriptures are and what I'm gonna do today is I'm gonna speak to you through the lens of the

213
00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:00.729
scriptures. And I believe that that is what gives me my qualifications through the work that I've

214
00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:06.489
done in my life as a, as a, as a servant of God and as a minister of the gospel and having studied

215
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:12.889
theology for my entire life and, and gotten a master's degree in it as well. I believe there are

216
00:35:12.899 --> 00:35:20.090
certain things that I can bring to this conversation and this topic that maybe you may not hear

217
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:26.229
somewhere else and may not fully understand it in the same way because I believe that the wisdom of

218
00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:33.979
God provides insight into this topic in a way that we ultimately may not be able to fully understand

219
00:35:33.989 --> 00:35:41.860
or grasp unless God accompanies us on this journey in understanding it. And so I want to speak to

220
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:49.330
you how trauma ultimately is just a response. It's, it's, it's your response. It's my response to

221
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:57.270
something that has been deeply disturbing or distressing something that has happened to us that we

222
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:08.080
just cannot fully overcome in the natural word and sense of its application in our everyday lives.

223
00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:19.879
It has a way of just making itself apparent in our relationships in the way that we make decisions

224
00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:29.409
in the way that we sometimes just interpret life events in the way that we can sometimes overreact

225
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.330
as well as under react to the things that are happening in the moment.

226
00:36:36.429 --> 00:36:43.040
And when we talk about trauma, it's often described this way. And so people who are specialized in

227
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:51.120
this area, they talk about it this way, they talk at it in terms of being acute and they talk about

228
00:36:51.129 --> 00:37:01.330
it in terms of being chronic. And then in the way that it is also complex and when it's acute, it's

229
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:09.260
like a one time event. When it's chronic, it's, it's about a long term response to that event. And

230
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:15.929
when it's complex, it's just a response to multiple and ongoing events that just haven't really

231
00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:25.139
stopped. And this is something for us to, to just evaluate very quickly as we proceed because I need

232
00:37:25.149 --> 00:37:32.879
you to make an assessment right now in your own life. If the trauma that you've experienced, is it

233
00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:40.449
acute? Is it chronic or is it complex answering this question helps you to understand the level of

234
00:37:40.459 --> 00:37:46.550
healing that you're going to need? If you don't know how to answer this question yet, don't be so

235
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:52.620
concerned about that because the definition that is being put before you is something that may just

236
00:37:52.629 --> 00:38:00.649
inform you in the moment. But the healing that you need and are requiring may come later. But the

237
00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:06.479
thing I can say about trauma is that it reveals the wounds that you can't see

238
00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:14.649
and how they can hurt as much as the ones that you can't.

239
00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:23.560
And so if you were to kind of figure out like, what is it that is traumatic in my life, I think that

240
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:30.449
you can do it by the wound that is still open where you feel like you haven't healed from this yet

241
00:38:30.459 --> 00:38:38.649
where you feel like this is definitely something that I need healing from. And so when we think

242
00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:47.070
about the wounds that we have experienced and the wounds that we have and how everyone maybe can't

243
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:55.939
see it, but we can, we can then sometimes open up about these things. We can sometimes go to a

244
00:38:55.949 --> 00:39:02.010
person and say, you know, hear the wounds or people look at us and they say, why are you like this?

245
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.570
They don't understand the trauma that we've experienced, the influence that it's had on our lives

246
00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:15.439
and, and how it's very much shaped our, our, our, our personalities. And so what God does is that He,

247
00:39:15.449 --> 00:39:23.479
he wants to help us to be a reflection of who He is in, in all aspects of our, of life and, and not

248
00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:30.679
just in our everyday life. And so what God does is that He, he comes with his presence and he

249
00:39:30.689 --> 00:39:38.250
reveals those things through people who start pointing out the things that might not be whole and

250
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:45.429
healthy about us. And without us necessarily understanding what it is that they're pointing out,

251
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:50.139
they may actually be pointing out a traumatic wound

252
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:59.159
and, and, and they may actually be highlighting an area of our life that has caused this trauma in

253
00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:06.790
us that now is just making us maybe a difficult person to deal with maybe it's affecting our

254
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:15.550
behavior. It's, it's, it's, it's somehow just distorted our personality and, and, and as a result,

255
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:24.030
people are not necessarily able to embrace us and do life with us at the level that we want and

256
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:33.610
desire and aspire to and hope that they will do that life with us. And then we keep wondering what

257
00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:42.239
is it about me that I can't keep friendships? What is it about me that I can't keep a relationship?

258
00:40:42.919 --> 00:40:51.669
What, what is it about me that I keep having conflicts at work? What is it about me that always

259
00:40:51.679 --> 00:41:01.179
seems that there's something that makes someone not want a journey and do life with me. Ok? And

260
00:41:01.189 --> 00:41:09.610
without fully grasping the extent of this and not oversimplifying it, either, we can sometimes

261
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:21.100
overlook that there is indeed a trauma that we have not given enough attention to. And so the first

262
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:30.239
thing I want to speak to you about is how trauma reveals the violators of our heart. The Bible

263
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:37.239
describes the heart as being the very place from which all issues of life flow. And so when we talk

264
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:43.899
about the mind and we talk about the spirit and we talk about the body, we understand the importance

265
00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:49.560
of this organ called the heart, how it pumps the blood to every part of our being so that we can

266
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:58.810
live and fully function and be able to do all the things that we need to do. The heart is key to

267
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:05.540
everything. And that's why when we talk about relationship with God, we often describe it this way,

268
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.969
invite Jesus into your heart

269
00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:18.500
because it was a concept that in the Old Testament, it spoke of everything. And so when you invited

270
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:28.770
Jesus into your heart, you invited him into everything, everything that touched everything. And so

271
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:34.840
when we ask you to invite Jesus into your life, we're also asking him to come into the, innermost

272
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:43.870
parts of your being, so that he can heal you in the areas of your life that you cannot reach on

273
00:42:43.879 --> 00:42:44.439
your own

274
00:42:47.129 --> 00:42:55.280
and begin to do a work in the areas of your life that can be described as traumatic. And when I say

275
00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:02.520
the violators of your heart, I mean, the very things that have affected you so that you don't have

276
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:09.580
as strong a will as you would like. And when you don't have a strong will and when you don't have

277
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:16.139
the discipline to follow through on what your thoughts are encouraging you to do and what you're

278
00:43:16.149 --> 00:43:21.439
telling yourself. And when you know what others are telling you to do, when, when we don't have

279
00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:31.320
control over that area of our life called will, then you know how easy it is for us to fall into

280
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.639
addictive behaviors.

281
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:42.860
And you look at yourself and you say, how is it that I'm broken in the area of my will and sometimes

282
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:49.709
the area where we're broken is in the area of our emotions. It doesn't take much for us to just snap

283
00:43:49.719 --> 00:43:57.669
for us to lose it, for us to go on a tirade, for us to, to get so angry that it doesn't even make

284
00:43:57.679 --> 00:44:04.850
sense because it doesn't even reflect the event that occurred. And yet there is no control over that

285
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:11.600
emotion. Sometimes that emotion can lead you to a place of deep depression where you are self

286
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:18.310
loathing and unable to love yourself and you are unable to forgive yourself. And as a result of that,

287
00:44:18.399 --> 00:44:27.459
you continue to self sabotage because your emotions are what is being affected by the traumatic

288
00:44:27.469 --> 00:44:32.909
experience. And so God says, I want you to pay attention that when I speak to you about the heart,

289
00:44:32.929 --> 00:44:39.780
I'm speaking to you about the will. I'm speaking to you about these emotions, but I'm also speaking

290
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:48.669
to you about your very mind. And when he says by mind, he means that all the things that we have in

291
00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:54.820
terms of not just knowledge, but, but here's where he adds to the knowledge. And he says it isn't

292
00:44:54.830 --> 00:45:01.909
just about knowing, but it's about applying that knowledge. And that's where wisdom comes in. You

293
00:45:01.919 --> 00:45:09.929
see, sometimes we know things, but we lack the wisdom to put it into practice. You can be informed

294
00:45:09.939 --> 00:45:16.659
on a lot of topics and be so like capable of winning per uh you know,

295
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:26.830
what's that game? Trivial pursuit? That's what I was thinking of. It's like you're just one of those

296
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:37.030
knowledge, people that when you watch Jeopardy, like you're amazing, you've just got the knowledge.

297
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.260
But, you know, people who are usually good at knowledge really suck at wisdom. Do you ever notice

298
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.610
that

299
00:45:46.899 --> 00:45:54.429
the smartest people can sometimes be the most socially inept. Isn't it true and incapable of reading

300
00:45:54.439 --> 00:46:01.219
the room? They can give you every answer you need in the room, but they just can't read it. See,

301
00:46:01.229 --> 00:46:06.129
sometimes knowledge isn't enough. You need wisdom. And what God does with the mind is that He

302
00:46:06.139 --> 00:46:12.189
doesn't just come to give you knowledge. He comes to give you wisdom. And so when he says that he

303
00:46:12.199 --> 00:46:19.320
comes into our heart, he's coming to reveal the violators of your heart. He's coming to expose all

304
00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:27.489
the things that need his healing. And this is what happens in Second Corinthians. I want to read to

305
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:32.530
you this passage and it's uh the Apostle Paul. This guy experienced more trauma in the Bible than

306
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:40.989
any other disciple and follower of Jesus. And that's why it says, are they servants of Christ? Am I

307
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.300
out of my mind to talk like this? I am more, I have worked much harder. I've been in prison more

308
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:52.909
frequently. I've been flogged more severely. I've been exposed to death again and again, five times

309
00:46:52.919 --> 00:46:58.729
he says I received from the Jews the 40 lashes minus one. Imagine what his back looks like?

310
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:01.939
Does he even have one

311
00:47:03.969 --> 00:47:09.739
five times. He says this happened to him three times. He says I was beaten with rods once I was

312
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:17.550
pelted with stones three times. I was shipwrecked. I spent a night and day in the open sea.

313
00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:26.600
I've been constantly on the move. I've been in danger from rivers in danger from bandits in danger

314
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:32.750
from my fellow Jews in danger from Gentiles. I've been in danger in the city and in danger in the

315
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:40.080
country in danger at sea and in danger, even from false believers, I have labored and I've toiled

316
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:47.620
and I've often gone without sleep. I have known hunger and thirst and I have often gone without food

317
00:47:47.629 --> 00:47:54.250
and I have been cold and I've been naked and besides everything else, I face daily, the pressure of

318
00:47:54.260 --> 00:48:01.000
my concern for all the churches. Can we say that? That's a lot. That's a lot. Right. He's been

319
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:06.929
through it. This guy's been through it and because he's been through it, the, the scriptures when

320
00:48:06.939 --> 00:48:11.659
they talk about these things, they also describe the events in which they took place. I'm just going

321
00:48:11.669 --> 00:48:17.060
to put it up real quick and we're going to move past it. But it's just like here are the, are the

322
00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:23.459
situations that he's describing and where they took place. And the reason I want you to know this is

323
00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:32.520
because the first thing that Paul does and I think this is really key is that we have to process the

324
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:39.120
trauma that we've been in, we've got to assess who the violators of our heart have been. And what he

325
00:48:39.129 --> 00:48:48.820
does in this passage is that he gives you a detailed events of how he has been violated in his heart.

326
00:48:50.439 --> 00:48:56.159
And it isn't just the harm that's been done to his mind and his will and his emotions, but it's also

327
00:48:56.169 --> 00:49:01.889
how it's been done to his body. It's the things that he's gone through all those traumatic events.

328
00:49:01.899 --> 00:49:07.139
He's aware of what they are. And here's the first thing, if you don't know who has violated your

329
00:49:07.149 --> 00:49:09.270
heart, how do you expect God to heal you there?

330
00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:18.570
If you don't understand their part and your part in it, how do you expect to recover from that?

331
00:49:21.129 --> 00:49:28.139
How do you imagine life is going to be any different and not possibly putting you in a position

332
00:49:28.149 --> 00:49:33.080
where you're gonna keep repeating the same mistakes if you don't understand what's happened to you

333
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:40.100
in the first place and you see, we've got to be able to identify the things that have violated our

334
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:45.550
hearts. And he makes it clear that the reason he even begins to explain all these things is because

335
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:53.340
there were a group of people who were saying that Paul wasn't enough and he's like, what do you mean?

336
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:57.800
I'm not enough. What do you mean? I haven't done enough. What do you mean? I haven't gone through

337
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:05.340
enough and then he goes and begins to describe it and the reason he does that is because he has to

338
00:50:05.399 --> 00:50:08.139
oppose the lie with the truth.

339
00:50:10.229 --> 00:50:14.879
You see, like if, if you don't, if you don't know what the truth is, then how do you know what the

340
00:50:14.889 --> 00:50:15.699
lies are

341
00:50:20.649 --> 00:50:25.149
when I hear a lie in my life? The only way I know it's a lie is if I know the truth

342
00:50:27.209 --> 00:50:32.280
and I think a lot of us have been lying to ourselves and hearing lies and following lies and living

343
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:37.530
our life according to lies, that we have lost sight and have no clue what the truth is anymore.

344
00:50:41.159 --> 00:50:45.889
And so there's no way that you can know what the violation of your heart is if you are living

345
00:50:45.899 --> 00:50:52.580
according to the lie instead of the truth. And so when God comes into your heart, the first thing he

346
00:50:52.590 --> 00:51:01.239
does is that he exposes the lies. He reveals the deceptions. He shows you the schemes and the

347
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:07.379
strategies of the enemies that you've had in your life that you have in your life and of the devil

348
00:51:07.389 --> 00:51:15.379
himself. That's what he promises to do. And so when we're talking about trauma, revealing the

349
00:51:15.389 --> 00:51:21.100
violators of our heart, we're saying God, would you reveal all the lies that I've been believing as

350
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:29.629
truth? And would you show me your truth instead and help me to live according to that truth every

351
00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:41.550
day? Yeah. The second thing I want to speak to you about is is how trauma reveals that we heal best

352
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:47.889
in community. And one of the things that the Apostle Paul does is that he always puts this beautiful

353
00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:55.659
understanding of what it means to be a part of a community of faith and, and to be with people of

354
00:51:55.669 --> 00:52:03.020
faith. And when we talk about being in relationship with others, he's really talking about how that

355
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:08.399
relationship is a spiritual one. And I think sometimes we have a best friend and we have really

356
00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:18.320
close people to us, but they are not equipped or capable of speaking God's truth into our lives

357
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:25.699
through His scriptures, not their interpretation, but literally His truth, which is not that hard to

358
00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:30.689
distinguish. I can always tell when it's someone's interpretation and when it's God's word instead,

359
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:39.100
I can always make that distinction because I know that God's word is unchangeable, but people's

360
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.520
opinion change all the time.

361
00:52:43.669 --> 00:52:49.229
And when we don't have consensus in the scriptures about a topic, then chances are, it's not

362
00:52:49.239 --> 00:52:55.560
important enough to go to war over it, we can move past it and just focus on the things that matter

363
00:52:55.570 --> 00:53:01.040
the most because those are the truths to live by and everything else is just extra knowledge that

364
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:08.080
you need wisdom in being able to apply in your life. And so when it comes to being in community,

365
00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:16.739
look at what it says in Second Corinthians, 13 to 4, it says praise be to God and father of our Lord

366
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:21.550
Jesus Christ. The father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all of our

367
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:31.750
troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort that we ourselves receive from

368
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:40.379
God. And God says that when He gathers us in community, it's for our comfort. And then the first

369
00:53:40.389 --> 00:53:49.270
thing that we often tend to do when we are traumatized is that we want to be alone,

370
00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:58.850
we want to do life alone, we separate ourselves from others. And I want you to know that this is the

371
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:05.189
lie that you have to expose. If you're gonna experience healing in your life. See, every time you

372
00:54:05.199 --> 00:54:12.429
feel like being a lie alone, I want you to know that that is a lie from the enemy. He is trying to

373
00:54:12.439 --> 00:54:19.850
separate you from his presence and he's trying to separate you from the community that he knows

374
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:25.360
you're going to find healing in. Thank. And he's going to talk to you about how you've been

375
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:30.399
traumatized, maybe in that community. He's going to talk to you about how people have failed you.

376
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.709
He's going to talk to you about how you were hurt in that community, how things didn't match up and

377
00:54:36.719 --> 00:54:42.629
measure up to the standard that you knew the community was supposed to hold. But I want you to know

378
00:54:42.729 --> 00:54:53.489
that even that is neither a permanent situation or solution to your isolation to you being alone.

379
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:59.540
God is saying I want you to overcome those things because where I'm going to heal you is going to be

380
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:06.090
in community. And the verses that we just read were all about how God is the father of compassion,

381
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:15.439
how He is the God of all comfort, how He comforts us in his troubles so that we can comfort anyone

382
00:55:15.449 --> 00:55:22.909
who is also in need. And so what God does is that He says, I'm going to give you the comfort you

383
00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:31.120
need in community so that you can now also be a blessing to others in that community. And so the

384
00:55:31.129 --> 00:55:40.280
answer is this, if you want to experience healing in your trauma, instead of prioritizing protection,

385
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:47.719
I want you to seek connection instead, see when we're traumatized, we want to protect ourselves. And

386
00:55:47.729 --> 00:55:54.669
so we go to places where we can do that and we often do that by separating ourselves from people

387
00:55:54.679 --> 00:56:03.280
that have hurt us. But what God says is that you need to do this instead, you're gonna heal best in

388
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:10.179
community. But more importantly, to stop prioritizing protection and start prioritizing connection.

389
00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:18.030
Instead, if you're going to be connected with others, you're going to see the accelerative power of

390
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:24.969
God in your life and how he's going to be able to heal you better in community than not the people

391
00:56:24.979 --> 00:56:32.379
who serve others and serve others with others are healthier people. They're happier people, they

392
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:38.820
feel more fulfilled and more complete. And it's because even though they are not focusing on their

393
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:44.939
trauma. What God is doing is that He's providing comfort in the community of comfort.

394
00:56:47.379 --> 00:56:55.979
See, church isn't just community, it's comfort because God is the one who is the father of

395
00:56:55.989 --> 00:56:56.639
compassion.

396
00:56:58.879 --> 00:57:11.629
Here's the third thing, trauma reveals itself when we press in to God and reveals the necessity of

397
00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:17.520
pressing into him too. I know that people when they came to faith and they made a decision to serve

398
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:23.239
God and to follow Jesus things got worse, not better. Anybody else experienced that. And, and the

399
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:31.100
reason that happens is because what God is doing is that He's revealing the trauma. He's trying to

400
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:38.250
heal you in the areas where you need healing. You can't go to a healer and not expect him to try to

401
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:45.250
heal you in, in the same way that you can't expect going to God and not expect Him to not have

402
00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:51.709
compassion for you. If you need comfort, He'll provide that. But if you need healing, he is also the

403
00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:52.139
healer

404
00:57:54.790 --> 00:58:00.889
and when you go into the presence of God, his intention is to heal you. It's to make you whole,

405
00:58:00.899 --> 00:58:09.169
that's, that's his focus. And so there's going to be pain involved in that because it's not always

406
00:58:09.179 --> 00:58:17.550
going to be something that you can just fix with a pill. It's gonna sometimes need surgery that is

407
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.560
not just going to be painful in the moment, but it's going to take time to heal and to recover and

408
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:30.510
you might need a lot of physio after that as well. There's gonna be a lot more involved in that

409
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:38.610
healing than you first expected and anticipated. And it may not take a few days or a few weeks, it

410
00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:39.770
may take years.

411
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:48.189
And I need you to understand that that healing process that you are in is, is one that is absolutely

412
00:58:48.199 --> 00:58:56.080
essential. But the way that it's exposed and in the way that it's revealed is when we press into God.

413
00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:04.020
And so trauma is going to reveal that we press into God. And it's also going to be revealed because

414
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:09.830
we've pressed into God. It's going to do both those things. And, and, and as a result in Second

415
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:16.229
Corinthians in chapter 12, look what Paul again says in verses nine and 10, he says to me, my grace

416
00:59:16.239 --> 00:59:23.810
is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in weakness and therefore I will boast all the more

417
00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:31.060
gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power may rest on me. And that is why for Christ's sake,

418
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:40.219
I delight in weaknesses and insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am

419
00:59:40.229 --> 00:59:48.560
weak, then I am strong. And in verse eight, it actually tells us that Paul had to pray three times

420
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:57.889
for something that was traumatic in his life to be removed and taken away. He asked three times and

421
00:59:57.899 --> 01:00:06.000
then God responded in verse nine, my grace is going to be sufficient. And what happens sometimes is

422
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:12.409
that the healing that we are looking for may look different than the one that we're asking for.

423
01:00:16.949 --> 01:00:22.820
And so because it looks different and because it isn't how we have asked him for it, we think that

424
01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:30.149
God hasn't answered. But what Paul reveals is that when you press into God, he not only reveals the

425
01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:35.709
trauma, but he shows you that in that trauma, what you need to do is you need to keep pressing into

426
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:36.189
God.

427
01:00:39.379 --> 01:00:45.570
And then all of a sudden, he's gonna show you that the grace that He can offer you the compassion

428
01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:53.060
because He's the father of compassion is going to be more than enough to help you to overcome this.

429
01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:02.879
Because what's sometimes missed in all of this is that nothing can change your past, but God can

430
01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:04.820
still heal your broken heart.

431
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:15.449
And I know that this is not easy to accept. But I think it makes sense to all of us in this room

432
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:23.580
when we ask God to heal us in our trauma, what we're a often asking Him is to kind of almost like

433
01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:31.489
take it away like it never happened. But God is saying I can't do that. I can't change the past, but

434
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:41.000
I can still heal your heart today. I can't undo what happened, but I can make you a new person today

435
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.459
going forward forever.

436
01:01:44.729 --> 01:01:53.959
And that's where Paul says your grace. God is not what I wanted, what I want. You to do was heal me

437
01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:55.320
the way that I wanted you to.

438
01:01:57.479 --> 01:02:05.040
I didn't want grace here. I wanted you to answer my prayer the way that I asked. But as he continued

439
01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:12.540
to press into God, God told him that he was going to do more than just that he was going to bless

440
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:19.770
him in ways that he never could have imagined and that he was going to give him purpose in his

441
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:27.540
trauma in a way that he could never have had, had he not been allowed to go through it in the first

442
01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:35.320
place. And so in Psalm 34 18, that's why it's important to know God's heart on this. He says that

443
01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:41.989
the Lord is always going to be close to the brokenhearted that he's always gonna save those who are

444
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.530
crushed in spirit. Do you believe that today? Is this promise for you? Is this gonna be something

445
01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:55.639
that you're gonna be able to remember? Not just because of the trauma, but because of the pain that

446
01:02:55.649 --> 01:03:02.590
you continue to experience today because of the wound that you have identified in your life. He's

447
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.110
saying that he's close to you and if he's close to you, he's saying that he's not just there

448
01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:16.260
watching things happen, but he's there to save you from the consequences. He's there to deliver you

449
01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:23.209
to make sure that you survive. It just like he helped Paul survive all of those tragedies and

450
01:03:23.219 --> 01:03:29.469
traumas in his life. You see, Paul looks at everything that happened to him, the times that he was

451
01:03:29.479 --> 01:03:37.500
beaten, the times that he was whipped, the times that he was brought to the brink of death. And he

452
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:45.580
looks back on all those times and he says, God was always close to me and when other things and

453
01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:51.760
others tried to crush my spirit, God didn't let it happen. You wanna believe that for you today? You

454
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:57.530
want to claim that promise over your life that whatever people have tried to do, whatever things in

455
01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:06.300
this life had tried to do that, they did not succeeded because Jesus Christ is the one who saves you

456
01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:15.189
and delivers you today. He continues to be everything that you need him to be. But here's the last

457
01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:23.110
thing I wanted to share with you and it's that trauma reveals that we can pursue purpose in our

458
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:32.979
trauma and that's difficult, but it's what we keep seeing in the life of Paul. Everything that he

459
01:04:32.989 --> 01:04:38.489
talks about. Everything that He describes is that, that God had a purpose in it. And it's not that

460
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:44.510
God wanted the trauma to happen. But it's, it's the way that God could redeem things. You know,

461
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.760
there's trauma in my life because of mistakes I've made, but there's trauma in my life also because

462
01:04:49.459 --> 01:04:57.800
of the mistakes that others have made. My dad grew up in an incredibly abusive home. Um He was

463
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:01.889
abused and it was because his dad was abused

464
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:12.419
and his dad was so abused that he abused his own family. He didn't abuse them sexually. He abused

465
01:05:12.429 --> 01:05:21.100
them physically and, and my dad, all he knows and all he knew was was that abuse. And one thing he

466
01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:25.949
promised that he would never do was that he would never abuse his Children the way that he had been

467
01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:34.060
abused and, and he stuck to that promise. I, I was hit by my dad and it was very, very few times. Um

468
01:05:34.909 --> 01:05:40.179
but when they were, he just didn't know how to stop. Does that make sense? Like something had been

469
01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:46.649
unleashed in him? And he just, there was no break, there was nothing that could get him to stop. He

470
01:05:46.659 --> 01:05:51.570
just didn't know how and it was almost like he was going into a trance and, and it would require

471
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:58.000
someone externally to, to stop him because he just didn't know how and it's what he had lived and

472
01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:03.110
what he had experienced. And I don't know if you've ever been in a situation like this. But one of

473
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.030
the things that traumatized me was the way that he would abuse my mother.

474
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:14.120
And I remember as a, as a small child, like, you know, just getting between this, this big guy and,

475
01:06:14.129 --> 01:06:21.159
and, and my mom and trying to prevent him from beating her. If you've ever experienced that it

476
01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:27.850
traumatizes you forever. There's nothing that, that saves you from then being able to love your

477
01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:34.090
father the way that you would want to because of, of seeing that and experiencing that. And if

478
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:39.870
you've ever gone through that, I want you to know that God is your comfort in this place. And, and

479
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:45.530
if you've been beaten and abused and if you've been taken advantage of and hurt in any way, then I

480
01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:52.689
want to pray that God just heals you right now and helps you to overcome that. But I, I, I just need

481
01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:58.070
you to know that there is, there isn't just um a story of trauma. There is healing for every trauma

482
01:06:58.489 --> 01:07:03.020
that every story has ever been said.

483
01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:10.379
And just like in my life, I never thought that God could heal my trauma

484
01:07:12.439 --> 01:07:16.770
and put me in a position where I could love my father and pray for him and, and care about him.

485
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.899
There were times when my father was sick and what I do for a living is I pray for sick people. I

486
01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:28.709
don't know if you know this, but I do that. And uh and I remember my father was, was at home in bed

487
01:07:28.719 --> 01:07:34.389
and my mom had called me to come home and, and, and I had gone to his bedside and my, my dad was

488
01:07:34.399 --> 01:07:42.639
suffering from seizures at this point. And um and it wasn't looking very good at all for him. And my

489
01:07:42.649 --> 01:07:46.310
dad whispers, pray for me

490
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.189
and I couldn't,

491
01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:58.270
sorry, I'm getting emotional. It's because he had violated my heart. Does that make sense?

492
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:11.979
I just took everything in me to try to muster up just a few words of, of faith to pray for a man

493
01:08:11.989 --> 01:08:16.339
that had, uh, had done such horrible things to my mom

494
01:08:18.919 --> 01:08:25.640
and it was so hard and I struggled through it and I don't even know if that pair was any good.

495
01:08:26.419 --> 01:08:28.390
Definitely not one of my best, that's for sure.

496
01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:38.829
And my dad could see that I was struggling with it, but I had been traumatized by him and I didn't

497
01:08:38.838 --> 01:08:40.318
know if I wanted God to heal him.

498
01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:46.299
I don't know if I wanted God to save him. Is that, is that horrible?

499
01:08:49.099 --> 01:08:50.508
But that's what trauma does.

500
01:08:52.979 --> 01:09:00.439
You know, it makes you turns you into a person. You, you don't, you don't admire, you don't respect

501
01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:02.060
that you don't want to be.

502
01:09:04.129 --> 01:09:08.529
And maybe you've never experienced anything to the, to the extent that I'm describing and maybe what

503
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:14.319
you've experienced is far worse. But I think all of us have gone through things and we can see how

504
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:24.109
easy it is that that trauma can reveal what our purpose is. My purpose was to help people. And in

505
01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:30.310
that moment, God showed me that I couldn't even be there for my father. How could I possibly think

506
01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:35.229
that I could be there for other people the way that he wanted me to. If he wasn't going to heal me

507
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:43.560
from this, then I wouldn't be everything he wanted me to be in this life. And so God had to heal me

508
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:50.600
in that room, even though I was praying for healing, for my father, that I really didn't want to see

509
01:09:50.609 --> 01:10:00.669
healed. But as I was doing that, as I was living out that moment, I realized what God was doing was

510
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:07.540
that He was healing me. But more importantly, he was showing me my purpose in my trauma.

511
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.859
You see what God does is that He's always gonna give you an opportunity to see your purpose in the

512
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:22.600
trauma. And that's what happened to Paul and everything that he describes. He's not just describing

513
01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:29.250
traumatic events, but he's seeing God's purpose in all of them. See, he's able to talk about it

514
01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:35.569
differently because He sees the purpose and I want you to imagine that that the trauma that you've

515
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:39.189
been through and the trauma that you've gone through, the trauma that you're still praying that God

516
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:45.459
heals you from. That, that in this moment, you may not have seen the purpose in it. But I need you

517
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:51.629
to believe that there is purpose in it and that God can turn things around for you and bring you the

518
01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:59.370
healing that you need because the trauma may not be your fault. But pursuing God for healing is

519
01:10:59.379 --> 01:11:00.770
still your responsibility.

520
01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:10.370
It is your responsibility. It is no one else's. This is your part in this. You're not responsible

521
01:11:10.379 --> 01:11:17.870
for the trauma, but you're responsible to be healed. So go to the healer because he can do it. Go to

522
01:11:17.879 --> 01:11:23.319
God, he's ready to receive you and to bring healing into your life. He's ready to do it in a way

523
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:31.560
that you could never ever do on your own. Romans 8 28. And we conclude with this verse, it says that

524
01:11:31.569 --> 01:11:38.890
and we know that in all things, God is always going to work for the good of those who love him who

525
01:11:38.899 --> 01:11:42.729
have been called according to his purpose. Do you believe that for yourself?

526
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:51.220
Let's go to Him for our healing. It's the only way we're going to overcome the trauma. Did you

527
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:57.899
notice how I still cried talking about my trauma? I want you to know that, you know, I'm healed from

528
01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:03.470
that, but it doesn't mean that we still don't get emotional from that.

529
01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.270
It doesn't mean that we just forget it

530
01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:18.580
because God is gonna use every past trauma to reveal your current purpose. God bless you guys. Thank

531
01:12:18.589 --> 01:12:19.169
you so much.

532
01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:35.509
I was just gonna ask you guys to stand as we just pray together. And, and honestly, we've got to

533
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.200
come into the presence of the healer and we've got to come into the presence of God. He's the only

534
01:12:40.209 --> 01:12:44.609
one who can heal us from our trauma. He's the only one who can help us to see and understand our

535
01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:51.270
purpose. And I know that it can put us in a position where we can truly overcome things like never

536
01:12:51.279 --> 01:12:57.410
before. And I need you to give God that opportunity today to really help you like like never before.

537
01:12:58.549 --> 01:13:02.339
And so father, you know what we need, you know why we need it. You know, the things we've gone

538
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:07.549
through, the things that have been done to us, the things that we've also been the cause of Lord, I

539
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:16.250
pray that you would not just forgive us, but I pray that you would heal us. I, I pray that you

540
01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:24.470
wouldn't just help us to forgive others, but you would help us see the purpose in it so that we can

541
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:31.990
move forward in the fullness of life that you have promised us. Lord, we don't want to be held back

542
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.270
by, by, by the trauma anymore. We want to move forward in the healing that you have for us and, and

543
01:13:38.279 --> 01:13:42.140
fulfilling all the great things that you have in store for us. And I pray that you would do that for

544
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:46.830
every person that is here today, for every person that is watching for anyone who would listen to

545
01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:54.700
this at a later time. I pray God that the right things would just touch the right hearts and that

546
01:13:54.709 --> 01:14:02.580
you would do that, which we could never do on our own right now. And that is bring healing to our

547
01:14:02.589 --> 01:14:11.370
trauma and give us peace of mind. In Jesus name. We pray, amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Thank you

548
01:14:11.379 --> 01:14:12.000
