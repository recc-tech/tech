in the Bible that there could be land mower race in the House of the Lord. Amen. Yes, absolutely. So

23

having said that seriously, we really wanna have fun. Uh in the church, we really want to celebrate,

25
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:53.380
we're trying to integrate all these different elements where we can just be human. So that's really

26
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.750
what church is about is being human and authentic. So

27
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:05.860

48
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.850

52
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:16.210

53
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.250
Yeah.

54
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:54.050
Things is, we have an incredible opportunity uh to be able to celebrate in this place. Um an

55
00:15:54.050 --> 00:16:01.620
opportunity to, to be here together as a, as a family and as a community of faith and to be able to

56
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:09.430
encourage and bless and to be of encouragement and to be of blessing to others. So one of the things

57
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:15.420
that we love to do at River's Edge is of course we love to have fun. I think that when you go into

58
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:22.640
an adult gathering, we sometimes think that we can't have fun. We're too serious, we're too old

59
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:30.320
where we should be more spiritually mature and advanced in our, in our life to be doing things like

60
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:38.100
an indoor lawn mower race. But this is River's Edge. We don't think like that. We think that the joy

61
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.590
and the fun that we have and the opportunity that we have to be with each other is always a great

62
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:51.590
opportunity to celebrate moments And I'll tell you why because this moment is such a sacred moment

63
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:58.980
but it's also a celebration. It's an opportunity for us to experience community in a way that brings

64
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:06.220
joy to each of our hearts. And so today we have a special moment that we want to share with everyone.

65
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:16.250
We have a family that is here with us. They're originally from Bc and have moved, we thought maybe

66
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:21.600
Montreal but they ended up in Ottawa but there's still a part of our community of faith and their

67
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:31.450
mother. Um and mother in law Lords is known to many of you and and lourdes is not able to be with us

68
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:40.110
here today, but her daughter and her granddaughter will be dedicated today and Danny and Amy, would

69
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:46.470
you come with Catalina and we welcome you to the stage as you would dedicate your beautiful girl.

70
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.860
Would we welcome them together?

71
00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.350
Okay.

72
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.760
Yeah. Just come this way, sorry, you have no instructions and I'm just like watching you walk by,

73
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.170
just come, come all the way around and uh

74
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:26.010
hey, it's great to see you guys in person welcome. It's so great to have you guys here. So this is

75
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:33.700
Danny, this is Amy, that is Catalina beautiful family right? And just come a little closer here to

76
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:39.750
the front and we're so glad that you could be with us today and we know that Children have always

77
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:45.070
had a special place in God's heart. They were always to be presented at the temple and they were

78
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:53.340
always presented to God and they were seen as a gift, I'm gonna know and they were always seen as a

79
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:59.920
gift from God and an incredible opportunity to be able to take what God has given us. And just to

80
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:07.850
say, I cannot I cannot do this on my own and you've got help. You've got support but we also have

81
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.510
God who's there for us and you have Jesus who accompanies you every day of your life to make sure

82
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:21.600
that your little girl is always blessed and protected and and is being able to be provided for. And

83
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.760
so in the scriptures, it reminds us that Jesus wants to bless the Children and when the opportunity

84
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:34.680
came he took them in his hands and he blessed them and and the disciples tried to silence Children

85
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:42.500
just like you know Catalina, but this noise is a beautiful noise, We don't need to silence this,

86
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:50.080
this is this is what a baby does and and when we have babies in our midst, yeah, you want to come to

87
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.550
me all right, that never happens

88
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:07.790
babies and pets, they know they know they know something other people don't know. And so it's so

89
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:14.910
good to be able to see how God just blessed the children. That's enough. Okay, here you go, this

90
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:23.250
feels weird and so in the scriptures were told how Jesus was able to bless this child and and the

91
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:30.170
Bible tells us that there's a responsibility that we do have as parents, but also as a congregation,

92
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:35.820
we want, we want our church to be a place where we can receive kids and and help them grow in the

93
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:41.030
faith and when the day comes for them to make their own choice, then we will have sown those seeds

94
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:46.920
and we have helped them understand why God is important in their lives. And so today I'm going to

95
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:56.520
ask both you amy and you Danny as parents of Catalonia, will you answer this question by we will,

96
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:07.170
will you by God's help provide a Christ following home for cattle leah and bring her up in the

97
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:13.880
worship and teaching of Jesus Christ so that one day she will come to know Jesus Christ as their

98
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:23.890
savior and follow him. And if so would you answer we will and then congregation, I'm gonna ask you

99
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:29.530
the same question will you members of this community of faith of River's Edge be faithful to your

100
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:38.430
calling as followers in the body of Christ so that Catalonia and all other Children in our midst may

101
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:45.280
grow up in the knowledge and in the love of our savior, Jesus Christ then please answer we will

102
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.730
and so we're going to take this opportunity now to anoint

103
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:05.050
cattle leo and we're going to do so in the name of the father, another son and of the Holy Spirit

104
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.770
one God

105
00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.350
okay

106
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:20.670
and we are going to pray a prayer blessing over you as a couple and over this beautiful baby. And so

107
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:29.740
father, I know that Danny and Amy love each other and I know Lord that you've form them into a

108
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:37.080
beautiful family by bringing Catalina into their lives and in spite of the challenges and obstacles

109
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:43.670
and the hardships that come with making a move as big as they've made and starting over in a new

110
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:51.290
city and having to raise a newborn child Lord you are continuously putting your hand of blessing

111
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:58.430
upon them as a couple, as a father and as a mother. And we also want to pray your blessing upon

112
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.360
their household. We want to pray a blessing on Catalina. We want to ask that in Jesus name that you

113
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.680
would bless this little girl that you would continuously provide for her, protect her and give her

114
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:17.580
peace. That you would use her greatly for your glory. That you would put your hand of prosperity on

115
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:24.950
her life so that she can be a kingdom witness to who you are and shine your light brightly, not only

116
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:31.890
in your home, but in the lives of whoever would come into contact with her Lord. We know you have

117
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:38.750
great plans for her, a great purpose for her and you are going to fulfill that and we ask this in

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:49.140
now, I don't have enough words. Now never live enough lifetimes to fully know your to know all that

152
00:29:49.140 --> 00:30:04.240
you deserve and all of my deception, All of my duplicity. Now there is no record. You assume the

153
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:15.200
best of me. So this is why I thank the Lord for saving me when I was weak. So I will sing. This is

154
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.500
while I thank the Lord for everything. This is why I

155
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:37.840
my affection. Everything I have to give some of my attention is measured in the praise. I live. This

156
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:47.790
is how I thank the Lord for saving me when I was weak. So I will sing. This is how I thank the Lord

157
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.260
for everything. This is how I thank the Lord.

158
00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:04.580
The Lord loving me and keeping me so I will sing. This is how I thank the Lord for everything. This

159
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:18.010
is how I the Lord. So I will sing. I will sing. I will live my praises to you. I will sing. I will

160
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:28.050

161
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:49.190
Mhm. This is how for saving me when I was weak. So I will sing. This is how I thank the Lord for

162
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.920
everything.

163
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.770
This is how I thank the Lord. This is how I met.

164
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.200
This is how I thank

165
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:06.850
you.

166
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.450
Oh, you,

167
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.450
This is how we thank the

168
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.630
great scott.

169
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.460
Mhm.

170
00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:49.360
So you may be seated. Thank you so much awesome. Seriously! Always good to hearing a good voice. And

171
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:56.140
sometimes we don't measure fully the talent we have there. So sometimes I may eventually sing just

172
00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:04.760
to appreciate more our very own worship teams and same thing if I do like your music instrument.

173
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:12.650
Triangle is my biggest strength as you all know. And all the rest is really disappointing. So can we

174
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:19.960
just man demonstrate them? Our appreciation again for the wonderful time we had.

175
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:29.640
Thank you. Thank you. So this is really, as I explained, a little bit early year for those who

176
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:40.310
weren't weren't there? At that moment we, we decided today to do our very own uh inside lawnmower

177
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:49.740
electric race. So that moment that moment is now and I will need like two men that will be volunteer

178
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:55.080
for that super race. We need pilot obviously. So if you you need to have your driver license

179
00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:02.580
honestly because we don't want to anybody to get hurt. So any driver license, volunteer, lawn mower

180
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:09.590
driver license by the way. It's important. So any volunteer? Come on guys, men, come on. It will

181
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:15.050
explain you there's a helmet obviously for your security. So for any of you that are maybe a little

182
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:22.370
bit shy about that. So yeah, there's helmet. Obviously that is mandatory. So any volunteer in the

183
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:30.170
man. Yeah, you know. No. So oh, he was just scratching his face. Okay. So sorry. Oh yeah Mackinson.

184
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:37.050
Yeah Mackinson. Yeah. Perfect. So just go out the back Mackinson. Perfect. I need another man.

185
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:45.410
Another man. Perfect. Someone. Yeah, he wants, uh, you've been designated. Yes. Thank you for your

186
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:51.550

187
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:58.260
Julian, um, that young guy here will really, you take a look at the line because we need young highs

188
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:05.210
really precise. So because I want you to told everyone who is the clear winner. Okay, perfect. So

189
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:15.640
guys, you can turn around because it will be, uh, the action is here. So can you realize that we're

190
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.660
doing that right now? Okay. Okay, what's your name by doing?

191
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.400
Okay. Perfect. So,

192
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.470
okay, perfect. Okay, perfect.

193
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:49.800
You're gonna just use this one full throttle my friend. Okay. And then boom, oops, it's not working

194
00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:56.420
power on better then. Boom. Okay, so I'm full speed, but if you're thinking like it's gonna slide

195
00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.160
every, Whoa, whoa mike. Oh, come on guys, whoa,

196
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:10.230
Okay. So if at any time you're both of you, if you're looking at your land mower and you're looking

197
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:16.870
at at that situation and you're thinking you're gonna lose control, just release everything and, and

198
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:23.890
pray. Okay. Just so that's really, that's the, that's the best thing you can do. So full throttle

199
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:27.540
here and, but you can, you can slow down the key.

200
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:37.820
Exactly. And there's, there's the green line at the end. Perfect. So guys, you can, you can install

201
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.360
your and don't push, you need to let the model do the job. Okay guys, because obviously we'll see if

202
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:50.320
you're cheating. Okay. So, and, and it's really important. Also, there's no prize. There's pride.

203
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:58.700
Okay guys. So really, so just start your engine. That's the problem with the electric race and

204
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:11.310
there's that vibe that is missing. So whoa, whoa, whoa, Okay. So then do we have engine noise? Hey,

205
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.960
C'est beau?

206
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:21.160

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:45.130
Whoa. Okay. Amazing. Amazing. Wow Julian. Who is the clear winner? I think that that 11, that 11,

208
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:51.340
you're sure it was the first wheel in front. Pretty sure. Yeah. Okay. Because that was mine, the

209
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.660
Makita. So it's the Ryobi the clear winner. Michael

210
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:03.650
thanks Mako also for your volunteer ship. Thanks guys.

211
00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:21.480
C'est, c'est super. Oh, that's it. Super. Wow. So you may be seated. Okay. So I think it's really important to

212
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:30.640
mention that, uh, that I. D came without any drug. So just to be aware. So, and you obviously don't

213
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:37.510
want to be in my brain with all of the ideas that are sometimes happening. Okay, so really, again,

214
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:46.940
can we just clap for Jonathan and Mackinson. Thank you for your courage. Um, so it's gonna be

215
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:57.470
announcement times. So you'll do short announcement this morning. Uh, obviously we're in our

216
00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:03.690
financial campaign from the future. We want to do great activities. Great ministry that we want to

217
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:10.030
launch in the future. And I know we skipped like the video about generosity, but I just don't want

218
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:17.760
to do this really as quickly and be able also to have sometimes with the message. So if you want to

219
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:25.250
be partners for with River's Edge, if you want to help to finance, to sustain the different

220
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:33.490
activities, you can grab a card at the end and really demonstrate that that support by giving also

221
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:39.280
monthly or weekly because what, this is what we are aiming to have a little bit more stability in

222
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.300
your finance. If you're visiting us today, don't feel threatened by the announcement is really for

223
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:50.920
those of you who have made choosing at that community to stay and you want to support us. Maybe one

224
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:58.160
thing also important to, to know there is a Krispy Kreme donut at the end of the gathering. So uh,

225
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:05.730
it will be a really good time to, to chat and to have some good moment of community. There will be

226
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:12.480
obviously the opportunity to take photos with your dad brian is there to take pictures with you are

227
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:20.190
with your dads are with whoever you want. But that's wonderful opportunity and you can choose also

228
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:24.960
the land more that you want to take a picture with the land mower as well about the Krispy Kreme,

229
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:31.680
something really important. You know, eventually, uh, there's, there's a vision there in terms of um

230
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:39.000
a renewed world, there's a new Jerusalem for those that are maybe aware that at some point in time

231
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.710
as Christians, we believe that there will be a renewed earth and renewed Evan And there are they

232
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:51.710
think they're talking in the Bible about nova Jerusalem like golden city and it's an image. I think

233
00:40:51.710 --> 00:41:00.610
it's not a golden city. I think it's a Krispy Kreme city. So that's just my personal belief and it's

234
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:05.550
not written anywhere in the Bible and it's not engaging in any ways. River's Edge community Church.

235
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:14.220
So be there for the afterparty And without further ado will continue with our series Multiply and

236
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:20.560
the kids you may, you are dismissed. Thanks Julian for your help. Looking at the line and declaring

237
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.320
their willingness. So let's welcome Pastor Lorenzo,

238
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:44.600
thanks to the uh our volunteers this morning. Just made it so much fun. Thanks for volunteering for

239
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.510
that. Well, we are in this series called Multiply and today we're gonna continue the teachings of

240
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.900
Jesus with regards to multiplication and what that means. And today we're gonna be looking at a

241
00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:03.870
parable that is found in the gospel of luke. And it's such a powerful and beautiful Passage because

242
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:14.280
in Luke. Chapter 14 and in verse 15-23, we're going to read about what this parable means for us

243
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:21.880
today and how it applies in terms of multiplication. So let's begin our reading, it's gonna be up on

244
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:30.520
the screen And it's Luke 14 And so hearing this, a man was sitting at the table with Jesus and he

245
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:38.730
exclaimed, what a blessing it will be to attend a banquet in the kingdom of God. And then Jesus

246
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:47.940
replied with this story. A man prepared a great feast and he sent out many invitations, and when the

247
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:55.950
banquet was ready he then sent his servant to tell the guests come, the banquet is ready, but they

248
00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:03.700
all began making excuses once said, I've just bought a field and I have to inspect it, so please

249
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:12.250
excuse me! Another said, I've just bought five pairs of oxen and I want to try them out. Please

250
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:20.810
excuse me. And another said, I just got married, so I can't come. Then the servant returned and told

251
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:28.920
his master what they had said, and his master was furious and said, go quickly into the streets and

252
00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:36.810
alleys of the town. And I want you to invite the poor, the crippled the blind, and the length and

253
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:45.330
after the servant had done this he reported, there is still room for more. And so his master said,

254
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:50.360
Then I want you to go out into the country lanes, and I want you to go behind the hedges and urge

255
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:59.400
anyone you find to come so that the house will be full. And we want to ask that God would bless the

256
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:06.580
reading of his word to our hearts. There are things about this story and about this teaching that I

257
00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:13.580
believe God is going to speak to us about that I'm not even gonna speak from my own mouth. that's

258
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.710
what the Holy Spirit does in our hearts and it's going to be something that he's gonna just bring to

259
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:25.450
your mind out of what is being said and so pay attention to all of it because all of it matters and

260
00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:34.510
I want you to see that in the story that we're in, the story is about a banquet and Jesus is saying

261
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:41.030
that he's the host, he's saying that he's the one who's putting it on, but a lot of people are just

262
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.300
making excuses to not attend and and of course we understand this because in our own spiritual

263
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:54.850
journeys, I think that even without looking for excuses, excuses just come, I think that it's easy

264
00:44:54.850 --> 00:45:03.860
for us to come up with reasons to not sit at the table that Jesus himself has prepared for us, we

265
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:11.360
have so much competing for our time and for our efforts, we feel overwhelmed by this life, we feel

266
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:18.210
like we don't have enough free time as it is. We live in a climate in which sometimes when the days

267
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:26.870
are beautiful, we want to be outdoors and doing something in the outdoors other than being yet

268
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:35.080
indoors one more time. Sometimes it's about just feeling tired and overwhelmed and just looking for

269
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:41.930
reasons for why it is that there are other things that are just more important in the moment and all

270
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:50.400
these things can be really, really valid, but when Jesus brings this up, he talks about them in a

271
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:59.040
way in which they are really bad excuses, not good excuses, not good reasons. And I think we can all

272
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:08.310
find categories to put ourselves in when we have a good excuse and when we've got a bad excuse, have

273
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:15.150
you ever excused yourself from an event and you know that you didn't have a good excuse? But you

274
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:23.120
gave one anyways and you felt really bad about it, but you just couldn't muster whatever it was

275
00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:30.540
gonna take for you to just go out and to be there. I remember when I changed my life and didn't want

276
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:37.320
to be a part of certain things in my past anymore, my friends were calling me out to do the things

277
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:44.070
that I used to do and I remember thinking about those times over and over again and how I used to

278
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:49.300
just make excuses for not showing up, but I wasn't really telling them what had happened to me,

279
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:55.060
which is that God had gotten ahold of me, that Jesus had given me a new purpose for my life that he

280
00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:00.350
had changed my values and he had just changed my morals and that he had put me on a path that was

281
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:06.580
going to be very different than the one that I had been on. I remember making excuses and at first

282
00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:14.270
they would buy it because I had never done that before, but then as I repeatedly gave my excuses,

283
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:19.790
they knew that something was up and more importantly they just saw that they were bad excuses. And I

284
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:26.110
started to get into arguments with my friends and they started to challenge me about why and and I

285
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:31.330
remember I didn't always have the right answer. I just just felt that I just couldn't be that person

286
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:37.580
anymore. I couldn't be where they wanted me to be. I couldn't do those things anymore. And sometimes

287
00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:43.300
it's like that we don't always have a good excuse. Sometimes you get invited to something, you know,

288
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:48.250
like when your wife invites you out on a date and then you kind of come up with an excuse that you

289
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:53.890
can't make it that kind of thing. No, I'm joking. You don't do that. But you know what I'm talking

290
00:47:53.890 --> 00:48:00.850
about? It's just sometimes you come up with a reason and these guys came up with reasons and they

291
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:08.380
were all like powerful reasons in and of themselves. But what the host saw them as was just bad

292
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:17.720
excuses and why were they bad excuses because they didn't understand what they miss. There are times

293
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:25.560
when you say I'm not gonna go and then like something amazing happens and you say I could have been

294
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:25.960
there,

295
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:33.560
I could have been there. I could have been a part of that. Has that ever happened to you where you

296
00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:41.590
declined an invitation and then you regretted it afterwards because you heard how great it was that

297
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:46.310
something spectacular happened, that you could have been a part of that. You could have been a

298
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:53.130
witness to, but you weren't. And so sometimes when you see the story, you don't always understand

299
00:48:53.130 --> 00:49:01.000
what you're declining my question to you is this is that when God is inviting you to sit at his table

300
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:09.070
to be at his banquet and you come up with the reason, Jesus saying I want you to know that you could

301
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:19.390
be missing out on something powerful that could be changing and transforming your life forever. And

302
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:26.490
I don't want that to be you. I don't want you to be the one who's on the outside looking in. You

303
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:35.080
don't have to why? Because I sent you an invitation. You were always invited to be at the table.

304
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:46.070
Always invited to be at the banquet. I just need you to show up and to be there. Another bad excuse

305
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:54.270
was seen through the bad example. See sometimes you think you've experienced it before, you've been

306
00:49:54.270 --> 00:50:00.170
there. You know what it's like, you know what's going to happen. You know, they're gonna sing three

307
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:10.660
songs, okay. You know, the pastor is gonna speak and you know that Ben is going to come back after

308
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:17.430
he's done. You know, they're gonna have like Krispy Kreme donuts, you know, they're going to have a

309
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:25.880
lawnmower race. These are not reasons to come. Why would I come for these reasons. And so we

310
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:33.980
sometimes have also a bad example of how we've been there before, but we know what's going to happen,

311
00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:46.570
but then we also kind of don't go expecting for something new to happen. I can miss out on this

312
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:55.870
because I've been here before, I've done this, I've experienced this, how about the times where you

313
00:50:55.870 --> 00:51:05.590
felt so strongly the presence of God, but then it faded and you went back to living the way you're

314
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:14.780
used to, haven't we all been there where God invited us to the table, we had an experience with him,

315
00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:23.570
Jesus had set everything there for us. We met him in a powerful way, but that didn't happen the last

316
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:29.370
time we were there. Fact, it hasn't happened the last many times. The fact that hasn't happened in a

317
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:36.550
really long time. And so, you know what, I appreciate the invitation, but this time I'm just not

318
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:43.180
gonna go and what's interesting about that is that they thought that they had experienced everything

319
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:51.070
before, but the way it works with God is that you have to be faithful. You have to be faithful in

320
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:58.360
the same way that is faithful towards you. So even in those unseen and unknown moments of your life,

321
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:06.090
your consistency, your ability to keep showing up is what enables God to keep doing a work in your

322
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:13.390
life and every time you sit at his table, he's ready to do something new for you to reveal something

323
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:21.050
new and and it's incremental. Sometimes it's not gonna be in these great, supernatural moments where

324
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:26.410
you're overwhelmed with emotion where you cannot even stand where the tears are falling from your

325
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:32.800
face, where the joy is just overtaking your life, where nothing else matters when you feel you're so

326
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:37.330
powerfully touched by God that you can take on the world and nothing can touch you. There are

327
00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:43.900
moments like that, but let's be honest, there are few and far between, but that's okay because those

328
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:51.700
become markers for us. They become indicators of how God is real, how he showed up in our lives, how

329
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:57.600
we have fellowship with him every day. You guys know that when you're in a relationship with someone,

330
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.340
you can also take them for granted, you know, that you can sometimes just count on their

331
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:08.040
faithfulness and their commitment to you, their devotion, their their loyalty, their, their their

332
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:14.510
their willingness to to be trustworthy in all moments, and you can sometimes just bask in that day

333
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:19.800
in and day out. You know that you're with someone that you're doing life with someone that you can

334
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:25.980
count on that they've got your back that no matter what they will be there for you, that's what it's

335
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:32.190
like to be in a relationship with God, I don't need him to show up supernaturally every day, I just

336
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:40.650
know that every day he's there powerfully present in my life and that if I need him and if my back

337
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:46.290
is to the wall and I need a miracle and I need someone to fight on my behalf, I need someone to pick

338
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:53.240
a crooked path and make it straight. If I need someone to help me up a hill or to help climb a

339
00:53:53.240 --> 00:54:00.900
mountain or someone who needs to give me the strength across a river or swim across an ocean. I know

340
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:08.220
God is there for me and I know that God could be there for you in the same way. And so every day I

341
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:15.290
want to sit at a stable, I want to accept his invitation because when I accept that invitation to be

342
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:24.450
at his banquet, here's what I know, I can experience what God has for me, but I cannot experience it

343
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:33.150
if I'm not there. So God is wanting you to be there, so we can have really bad excuses. And I just

344
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:39.140
mentioned some of them just looked at some examples, but I want us to see something else, that we

345
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:46.070
could also have four enemies in the story of multiplication. Because we're talking about

346
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:52.590
multiplication and I want us to understand that God wants us to experience multiplication in our

347
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:59.890
lives. The first thing that Jesus points out in this story, and it's really important that if you

348
00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:06.980
want to experience multiplication in all phases and facets of your life, you're gonna have to do

349
00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:16.050
this. You're gonna have to avoid neglect. Now, the first enemies neglect because in this story, what

350
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:20.760
Jesus wants to point out is that not everybody was invited,

351
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:30.810
it isn't just the ones who got the invitation who could go, but it was everyone else that everyone

352
00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:39.600
else forgot. And there were times in our lives when we are focused on the wrong people, we are

353
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:50.560
sending invitations to the wrong ones, we are focused on what we want and who we expect to be there

354
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:58.890
and why it is important for us that they are there. And then we miss out on everyone else that God

355
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:06.060
is bringing into our lives, but we are neglected and God is saying, I want you to open your eyes and

356
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:14.940
I want you to see that not everyone was invited. So when the servant comes back and he says I sent

357
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:20.820
out the invitations, but they're all making excuses, Jesus says, I want you to go back out and I

358
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:29.210
want you to think about why everyone else wasn't invited. And he begins to list all the people that

359
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:37.110
would never make it to the banquet. All the people who would never receive an invitation, All the

360
00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:46.980
people that everyone else says just isn't good enough to be there. And so Jesus shows us that we can

361
00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:55.800
sometimes have this attitude of neglect in our own hearts towards who deserves it, who should be

362
00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:02.680
there, Who should I talk to? Who should I go to? Who should I invite? And if we want to see

363
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:12.260
multiplication in our lives, we need to open up our eyes and see the world and everything in it the

364
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:19.150
way that Jesus does. And then all of a sudden we're going to see things that we used to neglect, but

365
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:26.010
now we're seeing them the way God does and we're inviting them to the table so they too can

366
00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:33.680
experience multiplication, can we say Amen to that. It's a beautiful principle. one that Jesus wants

367
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:41.490
us to really get, here's a second enemy. The second enemy is just a lack of vision. Sometimes we

368
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:49.450
don't know how to get those people to come and experience multiplication. And so what we do is that

369
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:57.520
we just go to the people that we think God would want their or the people that we think we know that

370
00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:03.570
should be there or the people that we imagine everyone else would have a good time if they were

371
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:10.520
there. And so we send out this list in our minds and in our hearts of who should be there. But

372
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:17.120
that's not how God makes his list. When God makes his list, he says I want you to go beyond the

373
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:21.950
people that you think you know beyond the people that you think are right beyond the people that you

374
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:27.900
think should be there and beyond the people that you think deserve it. And I want you to go into the

375
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:34.070
streets and the alleys and I want you to go to the death to the blind to the lame the people that

376
00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:39.710
everyone would walk by and not invite the people that are so broken that you would say this person

377
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:45.740
is so broken. For sure. They're going to destroy this party. If I invite them, this is the person

378
00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:50.320
who you don't invite to the party because they're gonna make a mess of it. They're gonna they're

379
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:55.730
gonna talk too much, they're gonna drink too much, they're gonna do something else too much. And

380
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:59.480
that's the person you don't want there. You don't want that person because they're not gonna be

381
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:05.400
dressed right. They're not gonna look right. And I want you to imagine where it is in your life that

382
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:13.380
you are making these decisions and when you're not experiencing multiplication because you are

383
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:18.600
allowing these enemies of multiplication to creep into your mind and into your heart and into your

384
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:24.530
life, Jesus saying, don't you get it. I want you to go behind the hedges.

385
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.690
Who are you gonna find behind the hedges?

386
00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:37.250
Someone who's hiding someone who's committing sins in secret. Do you understand what Jesus saying?

387
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:45.610
Who are you gonna find behind the hedges? Someone who's hiding not just from God, but they're hiding

388
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:51.420
from everybody else and only another person who knows what the hedge is about is going to go to the

389
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:59.340
hedge. Do you understand what Jesus said? He's saying, I want you to go to all those places and I

390
00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:05.650
want you to go to all those people that I am sending you to. But here's the thing, you are not going

391
01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:11.760
to know that they are going to say yes and you don't know if they're going to say no until you go

392
01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:18.930
and ask them to come. And surprisingly, everybody that Jesus told them to go to who were in the

393
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:26.800
streets and the alleys and behind the hedges, they decided to accept that invitation. And that tells

394
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.610
me that God, you've got to change my mind. You got to change my heart. That tells me you've got to

395
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:39.440
change my my view and my perspective of the world and of what it means to be a table and what it

396
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.450
means to have you with the head of it and what it means to invite everyone to it and know that you

397
01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:53.000
have provided and supplied everything that is needed to eat there. God I know that you are here to

398
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.830
reveal all of that. And could you do that in each of our lives right now, where we need it most.

399
01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:10.800
There's another enemy and the enemy is that we sometimes think we need to be superstars, Steph curry

400
01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:19.250
just won his 4th NBA Championship. That guy changed the game. I mean, little guy like that. four

401
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:25.820
Championships, it's unbelievable. He did something that most people never thought would be possible.

402
01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:32.020
And you look at him and you say now he's a superstar, he's got four championships, you could put him

403
01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:38.320
in the category of others who have won as many as him and you think you can't win without a

404
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.870
superstar, just like we think that way in a church, that's where we think that way in our life, when

405
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:50.440
we got a business, we think I need a superstar, I need a star player on my team, whether it's

406
01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:59.050
softball league or a floor hockey team or it's an ice team or any kind of sports team. You think

407
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:05.380
you've got to have someone who's just better than everybody else. And when you think about that, you

408
01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:16.520
would think in a way that makes sense. But let me ask you something, if Jesus, the superstar can't

409
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.520
get everybody to come to the banquet, what does that tell you about needing superstars?

410
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:33.760
If Jesus sends the invitation and everybody should show up, because it's Jesus, why doesn't

411
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:41.540
everybody show up one thing for sure? I I can outshine Jesus and I'm pretty sure you can too. You

412
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:48.300
may think you can, but I'm telling you you can't because here's the other enemy thinking that we are

413
01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:56.240
a superstar means that we think we could do it on our own. And here's what I know over and over

414
01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:04.020
again, this has been proven in all settings. Everyone needs to go

415
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.510
and when Jesus gives the invitation, all of his servants go out

416
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.990
and no one is going to win in life. If they think they're gonna win alone. Amen. We need to be with

417
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:27.760
others. And I'm telling you it is important to be in community. It's important to have a church

418
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.940
praying for you. It's important to have other brothers and sisters in the faith who stand with you,

419
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:38.810
who you can turn to, who can be in a small group with that. You can ask them to pray for you and to

420
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:45.290
help you and to challenge you and to help you to grow and there's no way that one person can do all

421
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:55.620
that, there's no way that we can disciple everyone. But if all of us go, we can and if all of us sit

422
01:03:55.630 --> 01:04:06.890
at that table, we can. Another thing that was an enemy was poor communication because when the

423
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:14.870
invitations went out, something was missed because it only went to certain people and and and we

424
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:22.090
sometimes communicate what we think the churches, we sometimes communicate what we think it means to

425
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:28.900
be a follower of Jesus. We sometimes communicate what it looks like to be a faithful servant, to be

426
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:35.420
faithful to the Lord. And it usually comes down two things that we do and things that we don't

427
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:48.050
but if God made it about things that we were to do and don't do, then he wouldn't have needed to

428
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:57.390
come in the flesh to show us what it looks like to live fully alive and to be fully human, Jesus

429
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:07.010
example is God made flesh, that we would understand what it looks like to look through this world

430
01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:18.190
and see it and love it and serve it differently. What does it look like to kneel before someone and

431
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:28.790
wash their feet? I can't get my wife to wash my feet anybody else. I give her foot massages, I can't

432
01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:40.010
get any in return, but and I don't got no nasty nasty feet either. So when you see Jesus washing

433
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:51.760
people's feet, when you see him do that isn't that crazy like he is the king, he is God made flesh

434
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:58.870
and he is washing his servants' feet, he is washing the feet of others. Why is he doing that? Because

435
01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:06.720
he doesn't want there to be any poor communication, what he's saying is that you are all as valuable

436
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:18.100
as me, you were all as vital as me. You were all capable of making a difference, just like me

437
01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:26.310
because I am going to come and be in, you work in you and then work through you and I want you to go

438
01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:34.890
to everyone and I want you to tell them that they all belong at the table. I want them to know that

439
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:42.390
everyone belongs at the table. And so Jesus saying, I want you to get this part about who I am and

440
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:50.910
what my heart says and that is that there are no empty seats at my banquet. There to be no empty

441
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:57.570
seats. Every seat needs to be felt. So if every seat needs to be filled, that means you need to go

442
01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:03.080
to every person because you don't know how important they are to God and how important they need to

443
01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:09.760
be at that table. And so let me ask you this question about yourself, what is your greatest enemy

444
01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:16.790
right now? What is holding you back the most? What needs to change the most in your mind and in your

445
01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:23.520
heart to be able to turn this around and to do something so that you begin to experience

446
01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:30.760
multiplication in your life. Because this isn't just about multiplying the table for Jesus. This is

447
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:38.130
about seeing multiplication at your own table. This is about seeing how God wants to do things for

448
01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:45.130
you, for your life, for your household, how he wants to bring people into your life and how he wants

449
01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:51.910
to bless you with the right people and surround you so that you can accomplish great things so you

450
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:59.350
can do what God is calling all of us to do. So when we're blessed and successful in our lives,

451
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:07.520
here's what happens. We can be blessed and successful also when it comes to doing things for the

452
01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:15.160
kingdom of God, for the community of faith, for the world itself. I'm always impressed when people

453
01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:25.970
love this planet and when I take care of it always just so inspired by that, I'm inspired by by by

454
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:34.430
people wanting to clean the rivers and the oceans of this world. I'm inspired by that, but I'm just

455
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:45.950
as inspired when I see people loving people, I'm even more inspired when I see a person caring about

456
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:53.230
another human being and elevating them out of the misery that they're in and the poverty in which

457
01:08:53.230 --> 01:09:00.900
they're in. I'm inspired by how this would happen in our minds and in our hearts when we would look

458
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:10.030
at people and not see differences, but we would just see people all deserve to be at the banquet and

459
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:16.140
that when we have something that God has blessed us with, when he has given us resources and he's

460
01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:21.940
given us compassion and mercy and love and he's given us wisdom and he's given us words to speak

461
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:28.730
that bring life that we can help elevate a person out of that situation and give them a seat at the

462
01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:36.260
table, whether it's talking to our neighbor or friend or family, friend or someone else's friend or

463
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:42.630
a complete stranger going into the streets and alleys and behind the hedges and seeing people who

464
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:50.290
really need God and really need to be built up and changed and transformed from the inside out.

465
01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:55.980
These are the people that we need to see the way God sees and bring them to the table that he has

466
01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:04.940
already set. There is a banquet that he is prepared. The invitations have been sent and there's a

467
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:11.160
lot of people making excuses. Guess what? When people make excuses, you move on from the people

468
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:20.060
making excuses and you go and find people who want to be there and what Jesus is saying that there's

469
01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:29.370
a lot of people making excuses, let them, it's okay. They got the invitation, move on. There's

470
01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:40.630
someone else who will say yes, look for the person who says yes and experience the multiplication of

471
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:47.950
seeing people added to the table. But the banquet is full and there are no empty seats. God bless

472
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:50.470
you guys thank you so much.

473
01:10:55.350 --> 01:11:00.540
And so what I ask that you would just stand with me as you would close in prayer and that you would

474
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:06.760
think about those, those enemies of multiplication and those warnings that have come to us through

475
01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.800
this parable from Jesus and the things that he's telling us to watch out for. The things that we

476
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:19.670
need to see changed and and be different in our lives and and how he wants to bring multiplication

477
01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:27.280
into our lives, but also into the lives of others. And so father, you have heard our heart and you

478
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:34.990
have listened to our voices. You have seeing our need and you are the one who I know that can meet

479
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:43.020
it. And today is a day in which we can come before you and and be welcomed into your presence just

480
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:51.050
as we are and brought into this great banquet and sit at your table. And your expectation is just

481
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:58.150
simply that we would say yes and that we would show up Lord today, We have said yes, and we have

482
01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:03.980
found ourselves here. We have said yes and we have come to your table. We have come to your banquet

483
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:10.220
and Lord, if our if our attitudes need to change and if our hearts need to be transformed and if our

484
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:17.020
clothes aren't right and if our Brokenness is an impediment, Lord, can you bring about the

485
01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:23.970
transformation, the change that we all need right now in this place so that we can experience your

486
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:29.850
multiplication? We want to pray for the fathers that are here today. We pray Lord that you would

487
01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:37.630
continue to bless them and keep them and protect them and guide them. We thank you for their lives

488
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:44.780
and for their sacrifices and for the way that they can impart an example to their own Children and

489
01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:52.000
how that example may not always be the best one, but that their love would shine through nonetheless.

490
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:59.660
And that you would help them to be a father who is in the father's image. I pray Lord that this

491
01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:06.370
would be true for all of us. God, I pray that for myself and for everyone here that we would become

492
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:13.860
the fathers that you want us to be. And we asked this knowing that our Children may be grown, they

493
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:20.550
may not even need us as much as they once did. Maybe the relationship is strained. Maybe it's not as

494
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:27.560
strong as it should be. But Lord, I pray that that would change today that it would move forward and

495
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:35.220
experience multiplication for these fathers and we ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thanks

496
01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:43.580
everybody, thank you so much. It's been a great privilege and a great gathering to be with you today.
