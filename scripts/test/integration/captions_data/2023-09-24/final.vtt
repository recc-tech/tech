11
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:42.619
encourage a life of faith, of love and of hope here at River's Edge. So let's stand together we're

12
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:48.960
gonna give God some praise for this beautiful day that we are here together and the worship team is

13
00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:49.950
gonna take it away

14
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:02.580
Jesus. We love you. We love that you're here. We love that. When two or three are gathered in your

15
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:09.140
name, you show up and that you're just going to show up for each and every person to hear God,

16
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:19.570
whatever they need. You know, and you care so deeply and this is why we worship. Thank you God for

17
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:28.179
creating us to worship. It's not just a song, it's the response of our heart to you and how precious

18
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:34.099
you are and how worthy you are. And I just wanna encourage you guys. I was thinking about this and

19
00:09:34.109 --> 00:09:41.989
I've been encouraging myself, don't ever let anything stand between you and your worship. Don't ever

20
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.340
let anything stand between it, choose, choose to lay it down. You can't give him this sacrifice on

21
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:59.609
this side of heaven. The other side of heaven, there will be no tears, there will be no tears. And

22
00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:07.520
so our praise through eternity is not a sacrifice. It will be just the response forever, but this on

23
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.520
this side of heaven, there are tears, there's things you're going through. There's things that make

24
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.169
you not want to open your mouth and sing. There's things that make it really hard to believe he's

25
00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:22.479
still good and that's just the reality. And I just wanna encourage you. Don't ever let anything

26
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:29.239
stand between you and your worship. And the Bible says that, you know, if we don't cry out the rocks

27
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:36.809
will, the rocks are crying out, the rocks are taking your job. So don't let them take your job, open

28
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.719
your mouth and sing to him, open your mouth, whatever comes out, you're created for this. You're

29
00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:49.270
created to respond to him. Don't let the rocks take your job. Don't let the rocks take what you're

30
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:57.479
born to do. Like let's be people who sing out to him with our whole heart. Even if it's messy, even

31
00:10:57.489 --> 00:11:02.880
if it feels broken like this is why we worship. We're not here to sing songs. We're here to bless

32
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:12.099
his name and to lay down, we're going to war by declaring the war has been won. So when you open

33
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:20.760
your mouth and when you sing, you are shifting that atmosphere, you're shifting that atmosphere and

34
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:26.619
you're shifting the atmosphere inside yourself. So I just want to encourage you to keep that in your

35
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:32.020
mind as we sing this next song. Don't let the rocks take your song. Don't let the rocks take your

36
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:38.460
job. Don't let the rocks take what you're created and born to do. Sing this together.

66
00:16:33.729 --> 00:16:41.630
Thank you Lord. Always being there for us when we fall. When we fail, you're always there. You're

67
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.789
always a constant there to pick us up when we and today I want, I know you're gonna do it again. So

68
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.450
we're going to sing the song and do it again because it shows your what?

108
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:05.459
This new song. Next song is a new song since we're wrapping up this series about God and the turning

109
00:23:05.469 --> 00:23:13.800
point, the song is called God, turn it around and I want to uh read this verse from Jere Jeremiah 29

110
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:22.869
11. And it says God says to us for, I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord plans to

111
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:30.939
prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and plans for a future. So let us know and

112
00:23:30.949 --> 00:23:37.989
be reassured that God will turn our situation aground. He will be the breakthrough that we need. We

113
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.060
just need to keep having faith and hope in our Lord and Savior. Let's sing the song.

142
00:28:10.369 --> 00:28:11.119
Praise God.

143
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.920
So I was in a season of my life where I was broken mentally and empty spiritually. And I was at a

144
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:54.520
point in my life where I had nowhere else to hide, to face my Brokenness and my anxiety and God's

145
00:28:54.530 --> 00:29:01.369
advice for me was to seek his kingdom first. And ever since then God has provided me with a job and

146
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.489
Christian people that I can trust,

147
00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:15.459
hey, everyone, it's so good to be with you. And I'm so glad that you can join us today for the

148
00:29:15.469 --> 00:29:16.459
series that we're in.

149
00:30:53.670 --> 00:31:00.280
And we think that sometimes it's just about the role and the responsibility that can satisfy that.

150
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:06.479
And, and unfortunately, we, we've come to realize that that often just leaves us empty and wanting

151
00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:14.560
for something else. I think today more than ever, we're being bombarded about just living life on

152
00:31:14.569 --> 00:31:23.089
our own terms and doing life in our own way. We're trying to be free from the 9 to 5. We're, we're

153
00:31:23.099 --> 00:31:29.150
trying to have a shorter work week. We're trying in every way possible to stop working altogether. I

154
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:36.449
think that we tasted something during the pandemic, that kind of gave us an indication of what life

155
00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:42.319
might be like. And for a while it, it felt really good. And many of us said, wow. You know, maybe if

156
00:31:42.329 --> 00:31:48.170
this could just be the way that I live my life, it would be amazing. And I get that and I think that

157
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:56.920
sometimes we can get stuck in a mindset that shows us more of what we want, but less of who we are.

158
00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:07.050
And I mean, that sometimes what we want isn't who we actually are meant to be what we're actually

159
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:14.489
meant to do and how we're meant to do it. And sometimes when we don't have those things fall into

160
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:20.819
place, we just kind of wonder where is God in all of this and, and how is He not with me and opening

161
00:32:20.829 --> 00:32:27.209
doors for me and providing and giving me the breakthroughs that I need in this life. And I believe

162
00:32:27.219 --> 00:32:36.170
that the Israelites were living this in their own every day. And we know that for 40 years, they

163
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:43.329
tried to make their way out of the wilderness and, and an entire generation of funerals had to take

164
00:32:43.339 --> 00:32:50.660
place before the next generation could inherit the promise. Sometimes we have to see the generation

165
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:58.719
before us, not make it before we're the generation that does sometimes the promise is given to the

166
00:32:58.729 --> 00:33:06.130
previous generation, but the one who inherits it is the next one. I don't know where you stand, but

167
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:12.930
I just see it this way. The previous generation is whoever came before me in my own life. And I am

168
00:33:12.939 --> 00:33:15.859
the generation now that is going to inherit the promise.

169
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:25.739
And so I don't know who it is in your life that did something along the way that didn't get you to

170
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:31.020
the place where you wanted to be and where the place where you are today is not the place that you

171
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:37.260
recognize as where it is, that you're gonna inherit the promise. But I don't want you to think about

172
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:42.880
it that way. I want you to think about it this way that this is a turning point in your life. This

173
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:51.000
is your crossing. People have often asked me like, why do we have this name? River's edge? I mean,

174
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:58.819
we're nowhere near a river, doesn't make any sense. But there was a time when I was praying about

175
00:33:58.829 --> 00:34:05.010
starting this community of faith and, and asking God for the name for it and, and I came across this

176
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:14.889
passage in my time with God and, and the river's edge speaks of the crossing. It, it, it speaks of

177
00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:23.719
the continual crossing that we're experiencing day in today and today and today, it's about this

178
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:29.580
crossing that always has to happen and, and the way that God is faithful to always part the waters

179
00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:36.780
before us. In fact, in, in Joshua chapter three verse 15, it says this, that it was the harvest

180
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:43.320
season and the Jordan was now overflowing its banks. But as soon as the feet of the priests who were

181
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:51.368
carrying the Arc touched the water at the river's edge. The Bible tells us that the water is finally

182
00:34:51.378 --> 00:35:02.520
parted and they parted and they were able to walk on instantly dry ground on dry ground. The, the,

183
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:08.120
the river bed, which is supposed to be wet and impossible to cross, especially in a flood season,

184
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:15.949
they were able to cross it because it was dry, not just because the waters had parted. And I think

185
00:35:15.959 --> 00:35:19.979
about that and I think that sometimes there are obstacles in our way. But what God does is that He

186
00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:23.860
doesn't just remove the obstacle. He prepares the ground.

187
00:35:25.919 --> 00:35:30.330
And I often ask God, God, I don't want you to just remove the obstacle, but I want you to prepare

188
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:37.250
the ground so that I can cross. I'm asking you for two things here. I'm asking you to part the

189
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:43.889
obstacle, get it out of my way. But I'm also asking you for dry ground. Now, when you ask God for

190
00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:49.459
those two things, then you are referring to promises that He has made to miracles that he has

191
00:35:49.469 --> 00:35:56.929
already done before. The thing about Joshua is that he's the second leader to lead the Israelites.

192
00:35:56.939 --> 00:36:03.199
The first being Moses and Moses being the one who first parted the Red Sea. But now the way that God

193
00:36:03.209 --> 00:36:12.300
is telling Joshua to part the Red Sea is different, Moses had his staff, but the staff has now been

194
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.080
put inside something greater.

195
00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:28.139
The staff was great and it was held by, by God's prophet. But now the staff is, is held within the

196
00:36:28.149 --> 00:36:36.860
arc and the arc is no longer a symbol of the prophet. It is a symbol of God himself.

197
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:46.629
And if we are to follow someone and believe that someone can part the waters for us, it is then that

198
00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:56.189
often we find ourselves still wandering and unfortunately not entering into our promise. But the

199
00:36:56.199 --> 00:37:03.649
moment that we believe that God is the one who goes before us and everything that we need is God.

200
00:37:04.899 --> 00:37:13.320
Then all of a sudden the waters can part. And I, I love the fact that that when this happens, Joshua

201
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:18.439
now takes on an even greater stature in the eyes of the people. The people now look at Joshua the

202
00:37:18.449 --> 00:37:23.709
way that they looked at Moses, the Bible says that they began to fear Joshua, which was to be in

203
00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:30.600
reverence and in and in awe of how God was with Joshua in the same way that God had been with Moses.

204
00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:37.919
And it was because they had seen a miracle. I think when we see people succeed, we look at them and

205
00:37:37.929 --> 00:37:42.969
we say that's the breakthrough that I need. And so I'm gonna follow this person to experience the

206
00:37:42.979 --> 00:37:48.929
same breakthrough. I'm gonna take the teaching that they have and try to implement that and put that

207
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:57.110
in my life so that I too can have my breakthrough and cross on dry ground. But when we put a person

208
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:07.459
before God, then all we're doing is just creating an idol instead of following the true God. And

209
00:38:07.469 --> 00:38:15.379
what God wants is for us to have what is true, what is real, what is evidently powerful enough to

210
00:38:15.389 --> 00:38:22.370
lead us to whoever it is that we need to be in and whoever it is that we need to become. But that

211
00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:29.699
can't happen if we're following someone, it has to be that we're following God. Now, I don't mean to

212
00:38:29.709 --> 00:38:33.780
say that they shouldn't have followed Moses and I don't mean to say that they shouldn't have

213
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:40.409
followed Joshua. But it seems that the people were always looking to who was leading them instead of

214
00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:47.149
who was behind the leader. And I think that when we forget who's behind the leader and we forget

215
00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:52.820
that who we're truly following is never the leader, but the God behind the leader then that's when

216
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:59.020
we fail and that's when we falter. And that's why the people just kept losing sight of, of what the

217
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:05.570
crossing was supposed to be like and what it should have been like for each and every one of them. I

218
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.360
want to talk to you about the memorials that they needed to set up because this is really the focus

219
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:18.939
of this message. The focus of the message is the 12 stones. And each stone being represented by each

220
00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:26.260
tribe member who went into the riverbed and brought the stones out and placed them on the shore.

221
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:33.020
That's the story that most of us know. But did you know that there were also 12 stones that were set

222
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:40.489
up in the river? You see, I don't know why no one talks about this but, but I find that it's, it's,

223
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:47.199
it's impossible to miss when you read the scriptures. They, they don't just set up 12 stones on the

224
00:39:47.209 --> 00:39:51.040
shore. They set up 12 stones in the middle of the river.

225
00:39:53.129 --> 00:39:59.469
And the reason they do this is because there needs to be for sure a memorial on the shore and this

226
00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:04.899
memorial on the shore. The Bible tells us in Joshua chapter four, verse eight and nine, it says that

227
00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:12.280
the men did as Joshua had commanded them and they took 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan river.

228
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:19.239
One for each tribe, just as the Lord had told Joshua to do. And then they carried them to the place

229
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:25.919
where they camped for the night. And then they constructed the memorial there. And the Bible tells

230
00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:31.239
us that when they built this memorial on the shore, they had to take large stones like they had to

231
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:38.159
be significant large enough. It says that they had to be carried on their shoulder. So it was a

232
00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:43.919
large stone and 12 of them would be the memorial to which God of course is telling them I want my

233
00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:52.860
people to never forget this crossing. But then there was also a memorial in the river. And this is

234
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:57.860
the one that I'm shocked about that most people don't know about. And I don't hear a lot being

235
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:05.620
spoken of when people talk about this story because the memorial in the river is just as important

236
00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:13.229
as the one that's on the shore. See Joshua set up another pile of 12 stones and he did so in the

237
00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:19.439
middle of the Jordan and it was at the place where the priests who carried the arc of the covenant

238
00:41:19.449 --> 00:41:28.820
were standing and they are there to this day. Now, why would the waters then return back to their

239
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:35.149
place? And why would the stones that are in the middle of the water get covered for no one to ever

240
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:42.719
see. But yet there'd be stones for everyone to see that would be on the shore. And, and it dawned on

241
00:41:42.729 --> 00:41:47.909
me that what God was basically telling the people of Israel is that you're gonna have an option in

242
00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:56.790
your life to be one of two stones and to have one of two experiences, one is gonna be in the river

243
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:04.219
hidden and covered for no one to see. And another one is going to be on the shore.

244
00:42:07.689 --> 00:42:13.290
And what he was saying is that there were some people who never got to cross this river and they're

245
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:20.969
the ones that are symbolized by the 12 tribes who never got to cross and they're buried. See,

246
00:42:20.979 --> 00:42:26.459
they're buried by the flood waters again, they're buried in the Jordan, the Jordan is forever a

247
00:42:26.469 --> 00:42:34.959
symbol of those who didn't make it. But God says, I don't want you to be those people. I want you to

248
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:42.810
be the ones that are on the shore. I want you to be the ones who almost made it. I want you to be

249
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.000
the ones who made it all the way.

250
00:42:47.179 --> 00:42:53.669
And he says, my promise isn't for you so that you don't get to the other side. My promise is to make

251
00:42:53.679 --> 00:42:59.500
sure that you do. And so I think about that and I think about that in my life and I think about all

252
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:07.739
the ways that that God is, is, is telling me that He wants to give me the fulfillment of His promise.

253
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:14.129
And yet there are so many ways that I just keep sabotaging it and jeopardizing that and making it

254
00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:21.510
difficult for God to actually get me to the other side. There's things that I keep doing to disobey

255
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:29.889
God that enables me to instead of having my memorial on the shore, it's in the middle of the river

256
00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:36.500
where no one can see it and over and over again. I wonder God, where is it in my life that I have

257
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:44.280
been so disobedient to you where I'm being disobedient to you right now, where instead of erecting

258
00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:52.959
stones on the shore, I'm doing so in the middle of the Jordan river, I, I've got answers for myself

259
00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:57.830
and that's between me and God, I don't know what your answers are. That's between you and God too.

260
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:04.100
But I believe that this story is speaking to us about both things,

261
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:12.429
speaking to us about the stones in the middle of the river and the stones that are supposed to be on

262
00:44:12.439 --> 00:44:19.719
the shore. And so the story is both a promise, but it's also a warning

263
00:44:22.189 --> 00:44:27.739
and the warning is, is the part that we often miss in the story because I, I'd rather talk about the

264
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:32.959
promise. I don't want to hear warnings. I don't know about you. II, I don't care about the warnings.

265
00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:37.620
I just want to experience the good stuff. I don't want to be warmed about the bad stuff, but God has

266
00:44:37.629 --> 00:44:44.340
to do both. And the reason he puts this on the shore is so that everyone who knows that these rocks

267
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:48.030
are on the shore can also know that there are rocks in the river.

268
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.929
So every time you're on the shore and you've crossed over and you talk about that moment where God

269
00:44:56.939 --> 00:45:02.370
gave you your turning point where He gave you your breakthrough. There's also moments where you from

270
00:45:02.379 --> 00:45:08.780
the shore can also look and see yourself in the river when you didn't cross over where there's

271
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:14.709
monuments there to the 12 things that maybe didn't get you across.

272
00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:24.229
There's something beautiful about that. I, I know it's sad. II, I know it speaks of death and

273
00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:30.580
judgment and condemnation and shame and there's an embarrassment that comes with looking into the

274
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.689
river and not seeing it. But, but that's not where God wants you to focus. He wants you to focus on

275
00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:41.610
the shore, not in the river. He wants the river to be a warning. He wants the short to be your

276
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.229
promise

277
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:51.229
and He want you to look at the river and remember the times in which you didn't cross over are those

278
00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:57.520
moments clear in your life. Like, you know, the times that, you know, you just didn't do things the

279
00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:04.080
way you were supposed to aren't those things a little clear now to you. This should be why because I

280
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:10.600
believe you have crossed over because you find yourself on the shore and when you look back, you,

281
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:15.850
you, you're able to look at what your life looks like when you're looking at the memorial on the

282
00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:22.489
shore. But it also speaks to you of the times in which you were in the river.

283
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:31.040
II, I don't know about you, but God is constantly reminding me of those times in the river. I, I

284
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:38.770
mean, constantly in a good way, not in a bad way. I think, I think I really believe that that the

285
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:44.699
devil does it in a bad way. He does it so that, you know, we, we never are free from that.

286
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:53.820
But when God reminds us, it's because he's asking us to look from the shore of the memorial where

287
00:46:53.830 --> 00:47:00.909
the stones are speaking to us of how we have already crossed over. Think of the progress that you've

288
00:47:00.919 --> 00:47:07.030
already made in your life. Think of the steps that you've already taken, think of how things have

289
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.750
improved and have changed. You, you're not the same person you were yesterday and the day before

290
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.750
that, yeah, there's still work to be done. And yes, there are times when we regress and times when

291
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:24.669
we find ourselves repeating some of the the habits and the patterns of the past. But, but overall, I

292
00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:30.870
know because God is with you that you are improving, that you are progressing. And so God always

293
00:47:30.879 --> 00:47:36.639
wants us to be aware of those two situations, the one in the river, but the one that's also on the

294
00:47:36.649 --> 00:47:47.060
shore. And he wants you to then take stock of your life and to take a deep and transparent and

295
00:47:47.070 --> 00:48:01.070
authentic gaze into both of those situations and say, where are you right now? Are you the 12 stones

296
00:48:01.649 --> 00:48:06.239
in the river? Are, are you the 12 stones on the shore?

297
00:48:08.739 --> 00:48:15.510
Well, in Deuteronomy, in chapter 11 and in verse 31 it says that you are about to cross the Jordan

298
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.639
river. And he tells the people that you're about to take over the land that the Lord your God is

299
00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:34.889
giving you. And when you take that land and you are living in it, he then says that this passage is

300
00:48:34.899 --> 00:48:42.889
really about us understanding what he's doing here. He says, I'm giving you and then you're gonna

301
00:48:42.899 --> 00:48:52.379
live in it. And so God promises to give it to you so that you can live it. Let me ask you something.

302
00:48:52.389 --> 00:48:59.679
Do you believe that God is giving it to you so that you can live it if you don't believe that? And

303
00:48:59.689 --> 00:49:05.330
here's what's gonna happen, you're gonna keep living your life like you're in the river instead of

304
00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.010
on the shore.

305
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:14.010
And so the way that they got to experience the memorial on the shore was being able to cross over

306
00:49:14.889 --> 00:49:22.120
the, the reason people didn't get to experience that and were buried in the desert instead is

307
00:49:22.129 --> 00:49:29.300
because they kept wanting to go back thinking that what was behind was going to be greater than what

308
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.000
was ahead,

309
00:49:32.659 --> 00:49:38.600
that what was behind them was going to be better than what was before them. And so then in

310
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:46.340
Deuteronomy 12, in verse 10, it says this, but you will soon cross the Jordan river. And then He

311
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:51.189
says, you're gonna live in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. And then what is he gonna

312
00:49:51.199 --> 00:50:00.120
do? He's gonna give you rest from all your enemies and you're going to live safely in the land. Well,

313
00:50:00.129 --> 00:50:05.959
there's a problem with this because a lot of us don't understand what happens when they cross the

314
00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:12.899
Jordan. But when they cross the Jordan, their first enemy is the most fortified city in Canaan and

315
00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:13.750
it's Jericho.

316
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:24.000
And so when God gives you a promise like this. What we assume that what's happening now is that

317
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:30.409
we've been through it. It's been really hard. Thank God. We didn't end up in the river. That's not

318
00:50:30.419 --> 00:50:39.139
where we are. We're on the shore. God has given us a promise. But then the next test is Jericho,

319
00:50:41.219 --> 00:50:50.719
the city with the tallest and the widest walls and they are the next enemy that needs to fall before

320
00:50:50.729 --> 00:51:00.239
they can continue to take possession of the promise. I think about where it is that you are in

321
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:14.040
relation to your promise and understand this, that the stones are always a memory, a reminder, a

322
00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:23.989
memorial to God's faithfulness. But it doesn't mean that you're not going to have more battles. It

323
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.639
doesn't mean that there isn't going to be another challenge. But what it does mean is that God's

324
00:51:32.649 --> 00:51:41.320
promise is still true and that if He promises that you can not only cross into the land but live in

325
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:49.899
it, he then promises that you can have peace in it and prosperity in it as well. And so whatever the

326
00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:59.989
challenge is in front of you, God is saying I'm going to be with you in that as well. I don't know.

327
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.030
What's the next challenge that you're facing? What's the next thing that is in front of you? You've

328
00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:12.340
just crossed over and you're thanking God that you made it, that you've had your breakthrough. But

329
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:20.449
you also have to prepare for the next thing because there's always going to be the next thing

330
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:30.610
because the promise isn't gonna be for us to inherit this earth. But it's going to be to inherit him,

331
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:41.719
who is the kingdom of this earth and his kingdom of this earth is unlike any other kingdom. We're

332
00:52:41.729 --> 00:52:50.139
not gonna have the peace that we seek on this earth. But what we are going to have is the peace of

333
00:52:50.149 --> 00:53:00.030
the kingdom that is ruled by Jesus in our hearts, regardless of the conflict in all the kingdoms of

334
00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:08.169
this world. See, he's telling us that we need to be aware of what is coming next. It's both a

335
00:53:08.179 --> 00:53:16.610
warning and a promise. And that's why it says in Deuteronomy 27 2 to 3, it says that when you cross

336
00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:23.129
the Jordan river and then you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you. I want you to set

337
00:53:23.139 --> 00:53:30.219
up some large stones. And then he says, I want you to coat them with lime or with plaster and I want

338
00:53:30.229 --> 00:53:36.729
you to write this whole body of instruction on them. So everything that was given to Joshua as an

339
00:53:36.739 --> 00:53:42.870
instruction for the priests to carry the arc of the covenant that as soon as their feet would touch

340
00:53:42.879 --> 00:53:47.209
the water and as soon as they would reach the middle, the waters would part. And then the

341
00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:52.590
instructions of the 12 stones being placed in the river bed just like the 12 stones would be taken

342
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:58.439
from the river bed and put on the shore. All of those instructions were to then be put on the

343
00:53:58.449 --> 00:54:06.030
memorial that was on the shore. And it says when this whole body of instruction has been put, when

344
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:11.120
you cross the river to enter the land, your God is giving you. Look at what he says, it's gonna be a

345
00:54:11.129 --> 00:54:17.360
land that is flowing with milk and honey just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors promised you.

346
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.110
But why is there another battle?

347
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:31.229
There's another battle because there is always someone who doesn't believe in God. There's someone

348
00:54:31.239 --> 00:54:38.620
who doesn't follow by the rules of his kingdom. There's someone who isn't working with God but is

349
00:54:38.629 --> 00:54:46.929
working with the God of this earth, which is, which is in many ways, Satan, yes, God is, is the one

350
00:54:46.939 --> 00:54:52.209
who's in control. But, but there are many people who allow themselves just to be governed by evil.

351
00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:58.889
And as a result of that, there's always going to be a battle and there's always going to be

352
00:54:58.899 --> 00:55:04.820
something that we're going to have to be protected from. And so what what God is telling them is

353
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:11.810
that the battles are going to continue. But I want you to also be aware of this truth. So will your

354
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:21.179
covering of protection? Your battles are going to continue. But so will my covering. Yes, it will

355
00:55:21.189 --> 00:55:29.129
continue. But so will I and so everything that you're going to face, I can get you out of, I can get

356
00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:36.610
you through, I can help you to cross over. And so I don't know, what is the battle that you're

357
00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:42.520
facing right now and you think? But I just came through a battle. Why do I have to go through yet

358
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:49.659
another one? Or God is saying my promise hasn't changed. See, I have to keep reminding myself of the,

359
00:55:49.669 --> 00:55:56.709
of the power of that promise. I have to believe that no matter what I'm facing, what I'm going

360
00:55:56.719 --> 00:56:03.189
through, that the power of that promise hasn't changed, that God is still faithful to fulfill it in

361
00:56:03.199 --> 00:56:11.270
my life. And, and I don't know if you realize this or not. But the book of Ephesians is a beautiful

362
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:18.489
book because it's a, it's a, it's a reflection of, of the book of Joshua in the Old Testament. See,

363
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:28.080
the old Testament book, Joshua speaks of how they're gonna take possession of the land. But

364
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:37.939
Ephesians talks about how we are going to take possession of the things of the spirit. And so the

365
00:56:37.949 --> 00:56:45.350
reason that we turn to the book of Ephesians is because it reminds us of the work that still needs

366
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:54.919
to be done when it comes to understanding how the promise is fulfilled. Yes, God gives you the land

367
00:56:54.929 --> 00:57:04.679
to take possession of, but he also gives you the spirit for which you can continue to battle. And so

368
00:57:04.689 --> 00:57:14.620
in Ephesians chapter six and verses 10 to 11. And it says this a final word. I want you to be strong

369
00:57:14.629 --> 00:57:23.500
in the Lord and in his mighty power, I want you to put on all of God's armor so that you will be

370
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:31.989
able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. Now, does it sound like the devil is going

371
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.860
to ease up? Does it sound like he's just gonna leave you alone and, and give up because, well,

372
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:43.560
you're a child of the promise and because you put your faith in the promise, does it sound like

373
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:49.270
you're not going to have another challenge and another battle and another crossing? Does it sound

374
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:55.139
like he's just gonna leave you alone? It doesn't not for a second. And that's why the armor of God

375
00:57:55.149 --> 00:58:00.909
is so important because he's saying, I want you to understand how all of it works together in

376
00:58:00.919 --> 00:58:10.070
covering you because the battles will continue. But so will my covering, my covering will always be

377
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:17.719
on you so that you can fight every battle and that you can still inherit every promise. You see,

378
00:58:17.729 --> 00:58:23.360
it's not the battle that you need to be concerned about. It's whether or not you're covered with his

379
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:31.889
armor. See, the battle is promised in the same way that it covering is he's saying the battles will

380
00:58:31.899 --> 00:58:39.669
keep coming. But I want you to be covered so that you can fight and overcome every battle and you

381
00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:46.649
could inherit every promise. I don't want your life to be a set of stones in the river. I want your

382
00:58:46.659 --> 00:58:54.860
life to be a set of stones on the shore. And I want the word of God that is inscribed on those

383
00:58:54.870 --> 00:59:03.129
stones to be inscribed on your life. And then when you talk about how God has been faithful, you can

384
00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:11.370
talk about how you are still on that shore. And when every time you go back, you can look into the

385
00:59:11.379 --> 00:59:19.179
river and you can say that used to be my life, that used to be me. That used to be the way I saw

386
00:59:19.189 --> 00:59:30.070
things and understood things. I often found myself in flood season, being buried unseen and unheard

387
00:59:30.969 --> 00:59:40.580
I found myself in the depths, but now I'm visible on the shore and I'm declaring his promises of His

388
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:46.760
faithfulness. And even though I have more battles to fight and even though there is a Jericho before

389
00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:53.030
me, if I can cross this river and if God can part these waters, he can do it again

390
00:59:55.050 --> 01:00:01.570
and he can do it every time I need it, no matter what the situation and the circumstances are. You

391
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:07.290
see, God is ready to do it again. Every time that you need it, do you need it in your life tonight?

392
01:00:08.429 --> 01:00:13.639
Are you gonna need it in your life tonight? Are you gonna leave it in, in your life tomorrow? Are

393
01:00:13.649 --> 01:00:19.810
you gonna need it? I believe that you will. And so every time you need it, God is able to park those

394
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:26.989
waters again and He is going to give you the opportunity to build your memorial on the shore. So

395
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
when you look at it, you're gonna be able for generations to come to talk about how faithful God has

396
01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:38.750
been, not just you, but the generations that follow you because you would have told them the story.

397
01:00:39.699 --> 01:00:48.669
And Joshua, it ends with this passage in chapter four verses 21 to 24. It says that Joshua then said

398
01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:56.590
to the Israelites in the future, your Children are gonna ask, what do these stones mean? And then he

399
01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:02.500
says, then you can tell them, you can tell them that this is where the Israelites crossed the Jordan

400
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:08.870
on dry ground. Do you see what Joshua is doing here? He's telling them that that God's promise is

401
01:01:08.879 --> 01:01:14.459
going to continue for generations. Said that this story isn't going to just stop with you. It's

402
01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:19.969
going to be told to your Children and their Children. Can we say amen to that? Are you guys ready to

403
01:01:19.979 --> 01:01:25.649
see that kind of fulfillment, that kind of promise fulfilled in your life where it's, it's

404
01:01:25.659 --> 01:01:34.020
generational blessing. I don't know what kind of generational life you've lived so far. I don't know

405
01:01:34.159 --> 01:01:43.120
what the past has been like. And maybe the the past is symbolized with the stones that have been

406
01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:52.000
erected in the middle of the river and they're covered and they cannot be seen. But God is saying

407
01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:58.820
that's not going to be you. Anybody else saying it's not going to be me. Anybody else saying it's

408
01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:03.889
not gonna be me. I'm not gonna be the stones in the river bed. I'm gonna be the stones on the shore.

409
01:02:03.899 --> 01:02:06.610
Anybody else, anybody else,

410
01:02:08.909 --> 01:02:18.330
anybody else. But that is not gonna be me. I'm gonna be the stones on the shore that people will

411
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:24.189
talk about for generations to come. See, that's what God wants for you and that's what you gotta

412
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:32.260
believe for yourself. Otherwise, we end up like the stones in the river instead of the stones on the

413
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:40.389
shore. I don't wanna live the warning. I wanna live the promise. I don't want to fulfill the warning.

414
01:02:40.399 --> 01:02:46.820
I want to fulfill the promise. I want that to be spoken of for generations to come. Let that be your

415
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:52.580
life as well. God bless you guys. Thank you so much, gonna stop here and

416
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:04.429
we're gonna have a special moment where our kids ministry is gonna join our worship team for the

417
01:03:04.439 --> 01:03:05.520
last long. Isn't that cool?

418
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.709
And we're going to ask that you just stand with us right now as we just prepare our hearts um for

419
01:03:16.719 --> 01:03:19.520
this beautiful moment that we're gonna be able to have together.

420
01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:35.719
And I just want to thank our um members of our worship team and in particular Brian and uh for the

421
01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:41.800
work that he's done and just playing every week and uh for Roger and others that have been a part of

422
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:50.689
that and, and then as well for our kids ministry leader Thalita, which is right here on stage. Can we

423
01:03:50.699 --> 01:03:51.679
give it up for Thalita?

424
01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:02.909
And uh they've been working so hard learning this song and so we just want you to show you what's,

425
01:04:02.919 --> 01:04:08.330
what's happening in the annex. It's not just, they're just not just, you know, learning a story and

426
01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:14.090
doing some crafts and eating something, but they're also um having moments of worship just like this.

427
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:20.870
And uh and we're gonna witness that together and we want to encourage you today to, to just continue

428
01:04:20.879 --> 01:04:29.149
to pray for our worship team and our kids ministry team and all of our teams. And um when I ask that

429
01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:35.439
we sing this song together, you guys ready to do that, let's do it. We see something. Hey guys, good

431
01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:48.629

432
01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:54.870
generation. And for that, I'm also reminding you that we need more volunteers to make sure this

433
01:04:54.879 --> 01:05:02.570

Hallelujah. Ok.

We've got to sing today and we've got Julian Taliano on the keyboard. And all these lovely children have

462
01:08:41.699 --> 01:08:47.949
practiced for weeks and weeks to sing this song. We are blessed to have them as a blessing. And if

463
01:08:47.958 --> 01:08:53.208
you would like to teach any of these Children on Sundays, there are sign up sheets in the back and

464
01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:58.219
we would love to have volunteers. You don't have to be a parent. Anyone who loves Children and loves

465
01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:03.778
the Lord can really have an influence on the next generation. So please sign up or see. Thank you.

01:09:38.958 --> 01:09:46.168
All right. So we have a few announcements to uh leave you with before we close out the service. So

471
01:09:46.179 --> 01:09:53.318
just a quick reminder, kids ministry is 10 30 in the morning every Sunday youth ministry is at 10

472
01:09:53.329 --> 01:10:02.020
a.m. Uh We have volunteers sign up today. This is really important guys, this is your church and we

473
01:10:02.029 --> 01:10:08.799
are the church. So if you really wanna feel like you own a piece of this community that you are part

474
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:16.310
of it, that you're in the fabric volunteer, help us out. We have um multiple ministries that you can

be involved in. I'm actually leading a ministry. Uh The connection team uh has a sign up at the back

476
01:10:24.609 --> 01:10:28.490
and so I'm going to encourage people to come out and see me. I'll be at the back of the room at the

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:41.540
people that are greeting um greeting us as we're coming in the church on Sunday. Um I need a few

479
01:10:41.549 --> 01:10:49.310

480
01:10:49.319 --> 01:10:54.729
to church on your own sometimes and we've all been new somewhere and we, what that feels like. So

481
01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:01.029
come and see me after the service and we'll get you signed up. It's not uh labor intensive, but it

482
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:08.649
is impactful. So I'll be at the back at the end of the service. Um this coming Friday, September

491
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:15.740

494
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:37.450
to the church that allows us uh to have the ministries that we have and to fulfill the missions that

495
01:12:37.459 --> 01:12:44.125
we have within our community and outside the doors. So there is a mission on this church. There are

496
01:12:44.134 --> 01:12:50.564
missions in practice and happening and every little bit counts. So thank you in advance for your

498
01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:04.379
ministry. So if you are in need of prayer, I would highly recommend uh seeing our prayer ministry

499
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:10.879
after the service. They'll be at the front side of the church. This is an opportunity for you to

500
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:17.290
have people partner with you in asking God to open doorways and create breakthroughs and to

501
01:13:17.299 --> 01:13:23.270
encourage you. Um I never pass up an opportunity for prayer and I would highly recommend searching

502
01:13:23.279 --> 01:13:29.240
out our team at the end of the service if this is something that you need. Um And finally join us at

503

504
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:37.770
be at the back for sign ups for our teams. Have a great week, everyone.

505
01:13:40.919 --> 01:13:41.770
