WEBVTT

1
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.800
Well, welcome to River's Edge. I'm Pastor Lorenzo, people call me Zo and I'm so glad that you

2
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:08.640
could be here today and welcome. We are nearing the end of what we call summer in Montreal. Once we

3
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.510
get into the end of August I know we're still in denial, but it's happening and I know it's hard,

4
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.970
but we are so excited that you guys could be here. And the great thing about summer ending is that

5
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:28.010
this place fills up a lot more and I'm, I'm more interested in seeing people back. Uh, and I'm so

6
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.520
glad that you are here and and a part of this and those of you that are watching online, Welcome. We

7
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.600
have a brand new series that we're in. It's called the genius of Jesus and the cool thing about what

8
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.190
we're talking about today, it's uh, the topic is the genius of the true and we're gonna be talking

9
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.790
about what's true and what's truth and what it looks like for us to become trustworthy. And I think

10
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.990
it's gonna be one of those messages that is going to have a powerful impact on our lives. We want

11
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.200
you to know that this is the kind of community that you can come as you are, where it's okay not to

12
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.510
be okay. Well of course, where you belong before you believe and we want you to journey at your pace

13
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:13.390
knowing that God's got this, he's got you, he's helping you to understand things and moving you

14
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:19.410
along on this spiritual journey that you are on. And He wants very much to bring about change and

15
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:24.710
transformation in your life like never before he's done that for me and for many of us here and I

16
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.960
know that God's got a plan for you as well. And so right now we're just going to begin by singing

17
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:36.740
some songs and worshiping God together. And the first song that we are going to do is called Yes he

18
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.980
can. And I want to ask that you just stand with me if you can. Um and and the answer is yes I can

19
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:52.700
yes, I can stand yes, he can help me stand. Yes, I know it's too, dad jokes one after another. Not

20
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.450
good. We're off to a bad start but I'm so glad that we get to worship together and we're just gonna

21
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.950
open an ordered pair Father. I want to thank you for every person that is here for the way that you

22
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.730
are surely in this place and with them and in them working through them and you're going to take

23
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:16.680
these songs as we offer them to you and make the words just help us connect with you and and bring

24
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.200
out our story in a way that makes everything that we experience today. So really thank you for what

25
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:30.380
you have done and what you're about to do and we ask this and pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen,

26
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:55.730
let's get this worship going.

117
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.250
Um in just a few moments and the first is another update with regards to our community kitchen. So

118
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:36.600
much progress continues to be made. Week after week not everything can be captured in a photograph,

119
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:43.610
but so much has been going on behind the scenes as we prepare to relaunch our community kitchen and

120
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:49.940
for those of you that are not aware our community kitchen is what in the past would serve 200 meals

121
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:55.460
per week in our community hall right below here and it's something that we would have the

122
00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:02.500
participation of local schools and even colleges and suggests that would come and volunteer. It was

123
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.620
just a great opportunity for us to serve our community. Um, just help people in isolation, people

124
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.750
who just found themselves a little tight on their budget and then others who were in greater need

125
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:21.270
and be able to also supply uh, clothing and school supplies and all those other things that people

126
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:28.650
just would need on a day to day basis. And so it was always a joy and a privilege to have this

127
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:35.350
ministry going here at River's Edge and we're just ready to relaunch again after the pandemic. And

128
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:43.060
so we were in need of some equipment. And uh, there was a hotel in St. John's issued you through a

129
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:50.930
contact through our community kitchen leader, Kathleen, that donated a commercial fridge and we just

130
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:59.140
needed to pick that up. And I want to thank Cal for coordinating that. There it is. There. So cal is

131
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:07.710
on the right and that's the driver Swanson who went from the gas bait to Quebec city all the way to

132
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:13.120
Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to help pick us this fridge. He was on another run and Cal arranged the

133
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.470
whole thing to make it possible. That's peter who helped them unload it and set it up and who spent

134
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.770
hours at the church waiting for them to come. Thank you peter. Um And we're so glad that that fridge

135
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:33.020
is now in place and it's gonna help us get that much closer to serving so many people week after

136
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.650
week. Can we just thank cal and uh would you just wait? Thank you so much.

137
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.110
And the second announcement I have for you is about our welcome back Sunday which is gonna happen

138
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:54.970
the second week of September so September 11, we have food and inflatables that are gonna be set up

139
00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:01.510
right here in the auditorium. Um so we're gonna do like a setup for small kids and then a setup for

140
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.680
older kids and then a set up for everybody else. And so there's gonna be like three inflatable rides

141
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.230
in here and we're gonna have food. It's gonna be a great party and I just want to encourage you guys

142
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:16.380
to come out with your family and your friends and and bring people bring kids that belong to you,

143
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:22.700
not kids you snatched from the park, that is not what we're looking for. So so if you have kids

144
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:30.160
bring them and if you know kids that you know you can bring bring them to. Um and I just want to

145
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.710
remind you that we don't have a kids program running today. Uh It's going to be one of the last

146
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:44.750
Sunday's where we won't have one, So it'll be September um, I think 3rd September fourth where we

147
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.560
won't have it either. But then it'll be back on September 11th when we have everybody back or

148
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:56.000
welcome back Sunday. And just for this Sunday again, we have no after party. So that means no coffee,

149
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.800
but we're still having a party. So if you want to hang out, um, there's no treats or coffee in that

150
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.700
kind of stuff that we normally have at our cafe. So we're giving our volunteers both in our kids

151
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:14.600
ministry and in our cafe ministry a break for the next couple of weeks. And so thank you so much for

152
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.170
understanding that in the last announcement with giving, Thank you so much for your faithfulness.

153
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:24.720
Honestly, like we've been so encouraged by how we've been able to navigate this this pandemic. And

154
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:30.930
also, um, just this season that we've been back, which has been so short in and of itself and we're

155
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:36.170
excited about what we're going to be able to do with the donations that you are giving us and

156
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:41.720
entrusting this with to be able to continue to make an impact in the lives of so many. And so if you

157
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:49.830
are also looking for a way to connect and to get involved, then just see us at the end at the after

158
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:54.890
party. There's gonna be um an info point there where we can just talk for a few minutes, myself and

159
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.890
a few other people will be there and we'll be able to just give you the information that you're

160
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:04.080
looking for and just help you to take your next steps. Alright, let's watch this video and we'll be

161
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:08.810
right back with this message called The Genius Of The Truth.

162
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.040
So one of the most renowned questions that was ever asked in the Bible is a question that actually

163
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:43.720
wasn't asked by Jesus and it wasn't asked by someone who was curious about him. It was offered by a

164
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:53.430
person in leadership, a person who had the right to release him or to have him crucified. And that

165
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:00.410
person was Pontius Pilate. He's famously known for washing his hands of the whole affair when the

166
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:08.440
Hebrews made their choice of going forward with Jesus's crucifixion. Although there was no evidence

167
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:17.160
to the claims that they were making, It was an unjust situation. And in that injustice, Pontius

168
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.290
Pilate asks a question and it's found in this passage that we're about to read. It's found in John

169
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:30.460
Chapter 18 and it starts at verse 33.

184
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.790
Now out of a conversation

185
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:42.420
like that. Would that have been enough for you? What happens to Pilate in this exchange that makes

186
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:52.970
him emerge from this conversation and instantly know that Jesus is speaking the truth, I believe

187
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.950
it's because he found himself in front of the truth.

188
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:08.130
He didn't hear a truth that changed his mind. He was in the presence of truth that his soul

189
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:16.550
recognized and could no longer deny. You see there's something about that and it's so important and

190
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:23.380
it's key to this entire exchange. And sometimes, you know, we we talk about having 1/6 sense, you

191
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:31.360
know, like an ability, you know, it's kind of like RBS radar, it's like this thing that we have that

192
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.150
kind of sifts through the garbage and we kind of sniff it out, we kind of feel it out, we kind of

193
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:43.860
have this gut feeling. Uh it's been called the mother's instinct, it's been called many things, but

194
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:51.020
we get the sense that there's something that isn't quite right. And I'll tell you that my

195
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:59.640
understanding of the scriptures has made me especially aware of this because what I see in this

196
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:08.340
passage is something that I honestly believe God has put in all of us and that is the ability for

197
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:18.340
our soul to know the difference between the truth and a lie

198
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:32.500
and I think that we don't always know how to articulated, we don't always know how to express it and

199
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:43.990
call it what it is. We don't always know how to explain it. We don't always know how we can even

200
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:55.970
prove it, but we know that there is something in this moment that tells us that this is either a lie

201
00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:57.970
or it's true

202
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:09.190
and Pontius is in this moment, Pilate in this moment ask this question that has had repercussions

203
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.220
around the world. It is a question that is known in all religions and all expressions of faith and

204
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:22.810
spirituality. It is something that men and women since the beginning of time have pondered what is

205
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:31.680
truth and I believe is that God has given us a compass, an internal ability

206
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:43.010
that has been woven into the very fabric of our essence to help us discover that truth.

207
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:55.590
And with just a few questions Pilate was able to discern that everything that Jesus said was true and

208
00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.170
everything that he had heard had not been. And I want you to imagine that we're seeing a quick

209
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:09.410
exchange between Pilate and Jesus. But I want you to imagine how many exchanges over the course of

210
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:15.060
3.5 years there must have been between the religious leaders and Pilate himself. You understand what

211
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:24.110
I'm saying that all along when Jesus was out there helping people and doing miracles and teaching

212
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:34.890
and telling them about a new way of life and living in a new kingdom and a new way of understanding

213
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:44.020
what that kingdom was and new ways of living out those values in God's kingdom instead of the

214
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:51.210
earthly one. They were a part of that all those times that there were those exchanges between the

215
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:57.960
high priest and Pilate, they were always trying to convince him of why he would need to be arrested

216
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:05.860
and why he would need to be tried and why he would one day need to be killed. And in just a few

217
00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:16.500
short seconds, Pilate, after hearing years of debate over Jesus in a few short seconds, is able to

218
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.350
come to the conclusion

219
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:32.300
that he is innocent of everything that they've been saying, because he was finally in front of that,

220
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:40.270
which was true. I don't know about you, but I think we're all a little obsessed about knowing the

221
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.900
truth.

222
00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.020
And I know that some of us, like we're either very deep into conspiracy theories or we're not into

223
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:57.580
them at all right. But the truth is is that we have to believe that people lie. We have to believe

224
00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:03.420
that our governments lie to us. We have to believe that not everything that we're told is the truth.

225
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:12.220
Would we agree on that? So even if we don't fully agree on conspiracy theories, we believe that we

226
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.550
are not always being told the truth, that it's being withheld, it's being distorted, it's being

227
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:24.050
manipulated. And sometimes we're being outright lied. And and the reason sometimes is that it's for

228
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:29.880
our own protection. That's sometimes what it's what we've been told or or what they tell themselves,

229
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.770
and they feel that this is for the greater good and what we've done sometimes is when we've been

230
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.520
asked the question, like do I look fat in these jeans? We have outright lied

231
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:51.220
and we have done this for the greater good of our own life survival? We have done this. We have lied.

232
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:58.590
Why? Because we feel that sometimes saying a lie, even what we would call a white lie is okay given

233
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:05.880
the circumstances because we believe that it's better for everyone concerned. So when someone comes

234
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:14.010
and asks us: did person say anything bad about me? You say no, not a word. Although you had to

235
00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:21.930
listen to all the bad things for about two hours. There are so many times in which we have just lied

236
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:27.040
because we just didn't want to deal with it or we didn't want to get brought into it or because we

237
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:35.820
didn't want to have to you know, just say the truth, but I need you to understand that. Would you

238
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:46.190
recognize the truth of who was standing right in front of you? And that's a question not for Pilate

239
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:53.650
anymore. It's a question for us because Pilate answered that question when the truth stood in front

240
00:39:53.650 --> 00:40:01.490
of him, we recognized it. But I feel like sometimes in my life I haven't been as good as that

241
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:09.530
anybody else, like when I stood in front of the truth, I didn't want to face it, you know, people

242
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:15.780
were bringing things up and talking about my character like it was somebody else. You know, I was

243
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:22.860
like who are you talking about? Like I am so amazing. Why can't you see that? Like how could you

244
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.110
possibly find anything bad to say about me?

245
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:36.780
Are we even talking about me right now? Is this about somebody else? Come on. It's gotta be because

246
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:48.780
there's no flaw in this, right? Sometimes when people talk to us and they confront us with the truth,

247
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:59.450
we do not want to hear, oh we don't want to hear that. We are not gonna listen to that. We are gonna

248
00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:08.040
push back on this now is the time to bring up stuff from the other person, stuff that I've been

249
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:15.760
holding back on, stuff that I didn't want to say stuff that I've been piling up for years. Here it

250
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.350
comes

251
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:30.410
and we just vomit all that garbage all over the other person. Right? Okay. This is just me talking

252
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:37.760
about my life, not yours. Obviously because you guys are just too like good, This has never happened

253
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:47.620
to any of you, right? So when we stand in front of people and we hear the hard truth, I want you to

254
00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:52.630
understand something that person has loved us

255
00:41:55.050 --> 00:42:00.640
in that moment so much that they would rather us hear the truth than a lie.

256
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:09.380
And I know that it may not always be delivered, right? And I know that most times it's going to be

257
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:16.640
delivered in a way that we do not accept it and most times it will be delivered from a source that

258
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:33.400
we generally hate? And mistrust. But when we are standing in front of the truth, are we willing

259
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:46.300
to hear it, see it accepted and do something about it. I'd like to think that the people in this

260
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.810
room to that question

261
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920
would say yes,

262
00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:11.520
because that is where my soul is directing me. That is where my essence lips that is my purpose to

263
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:25.520
be a bear of the truth. To reflect it to powerfully exercise it. No matter what context I may find

264
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:34.130
myself in and whether I am the one who is to speak it or I am the one who is to receive it, I will

265
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.660
be a bear of the truth.

266
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:49.510
We have somehow deceived ourselves into believing that lies can sometimes lead us to the truth. And

267
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:56.330
I want you to know that the lie is just a lie. What leads us to the truth is only that which is true.

268
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.460
Sometimes we've said things like, well, if it's true to you

269
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:12.720
and if it's true to me, then why don't we just like name this nice little club and see if there's

270
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.100
other members that can join it.

271
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:23.070
Sometimes we just look for agreement. And I want you to know The difference is huge between

272
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:31.990
agreement and truth. You can be in agreement with a lie and keep you forever from the truth And

273
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:38.450
being surrounded by people who lie to you because they want you to simply have Agreement is not the

274
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:47.650
truth. Truth is something that can stand powerfully independently on its own and have the ability to

275
00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:55.840
lead us all to a place where we are not only reflecting the image of God, we are reflecting his

276
00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:08.210
truth in this world, that he enables us to do so much with that. I believe that truth always leads

277
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:18.390
to goodness. I believe that truth leads us to experiencing that which is good. You can't have too

278
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.830
much of a good thing. Have you ever heard that phrase? You can't have too much of a good thing. And

279
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:28.620
usually people are talking about a bad thing when they say that right? Like there are some things

280
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:33.730
that are just like not good to have too much of we know that and there are things that we can

281
00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:40.260
honestly look at and say, you know too much of a good thing, you know can't happen or it can't be

282
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:47.040
real in this situation. But if you drink too much water, too much of a good thing can also be bad

283
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:56.610
for you. If you take in too much air, too much of a good thing can actually be bad for you. There is

284
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:04.300
only one thing in this world that if you take it in fully, all it does is that it keeps nourishing

285
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:14.800
your essence and your soul, it brings more life to your life. And that is the truth that is Jesus

286
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:22.910
Christ and what that truth does and having that as a good thing in your life, what it does is that

287
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:29.700
it impacts your character And there's this beautiful, wonderful list that's found in Galatians

288
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:37.730
chapter five and it begins at verse 22 and it illustrates what too much of a good thing can do. It

289
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:43.800
takes a person who is impatient and gives them patience. It takes a person who is unable to forgive

290
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:49.490
and is filled with hatred and fills them with love. It takes a person who is distraught and

291
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:56.740
depressed and gives them peace. It takes any one of us that found, finds ourselves and not able to

292
00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:04.420
be kind or good in a certain situation towards a certain person and all of a sudden we can do both

293
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:12.330
of those things and they come easily to us because what we have taken in is a truth that has brought

294
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:22.370
about a transformation. See there's some things that God wants to bring into our life that reveal

295
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:32.300
and demonstrate how powerful he truly is. I want you to believe this. There isn't a good lie that

296
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.910
makes us better. Even if it makes us feel better.

297
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.110
There is no such thing as a good life.

298
00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:51.130
I think that when we communicate the truth in love and then we build a person up instead of tearing

299
00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:58.820
them down. I think that when we say the truth in a way to encourage when we say the truth by showing

300
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:05.000
them a new way in a new path. When we say the truth to tell them, why do you want to live here and

301
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.970
settle for this, when I can show you the way to get there and experience that, why would you limit

302
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:21.510
yourself to so little when God has offered you so much more? You see I can speak the truth, that is

303
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:28.610
hard, but I can do it in a way that builds and encourages and moves and propels us forward in a

304
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:39.060
manner that doesn't just somehow benefit me. It truly brings about change in the person that truth

305
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:48.540
is being spoken to. We need to become truth tellers, not storytellers, there's enough storytellers

306
00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.400
in the world, but there aren't enough truth Sayers,

307
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:06.050
I know that God has put you here on this earth to be exactly that a truth Sayer to speak the truth

308
00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:16.280
and what Pilate does is that he he reveals the difference between the true and the truth.

309
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:24.000
And even though Jesus didn't give him a lot of explanation and actually didn't answer a single

310
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.910
question, if you look at it, talk about being evasive like that was like a master class, people

311
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:37.390
would pay thousands you know, to to be in that master class that Jesus would give on how to not

312
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.310
answer any questions

313
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:50.090
and still speak the truth, he did it and in that moment when he did it, he did it so that we would

314
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:59.980
understand that that when we used the truth to manipulate and when we use the truth to our personal

315
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.350
benefit, guess what? It's still alive?

316
00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:07.780
It's a lie.

317
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.410
Text...

318
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:18.820
So if I have to manipulate this, if I have to massage it even just a little, I gotta take out of a

319
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:26.850
tool for my toolbox and buff it up just a bit, make it a little bit shiner than it actually is. Then

320
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:29.910
I am probably doing this for my benefit, not for theirs.

321
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:42.610
And I gotta catch that in myself. What do I have this internal need to manipulate this? Is this even

322
00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:47.710
worth it? Like what am I talking about here? Does it really matter the size of the fish that I

323
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:54.760
caught? Like come on or the fact that I didn't catch any, but I said I did but I came back empty

324
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.860
handed once again

325
00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:07.110
why why can't I just say that you know the that I failed that the business failed, not that I was

326
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.570
like bought out,

327
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:15.850
why can't I speak the truth when people ask questions you ever ask yourself that what are you

328
00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:21.600
manipulating? What are you trying to make you feel better in all of this yourself? Them like think

329
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.130
about that. So the motivation that we sometimes have that God just wants to expose that garbage, he

330
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:32.460
just wants to bring it to the surface. He wants you to see it for what it is, he wants that truth to

331
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:39.090
be seen and known and understood so that you don't have to live there. Why? Because he's got so much

332
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:47.210
better for all of us. Why would we want just that? Why would that little bit of satisfaction or that

333
00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:53.180
escapism or that ability to just walk out of that situation without having to be honest about what

334
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.950
has really happened, What has really occurred? Why is that so important to me? More important than

335
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:05.770
telling the truth? And I have to say I have to change, I have to say no, this will not be me. I want

336
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:15.800
to not just speak the truth. I want to fully represent the truth that is in me. And that truth is

337
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.620
Jesus Christ.

338
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:25.580
You know I was always surprised by the 10 commandments anybody else like like like God is so

339
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:34.710
obviously he's a smart, smart, smart, smart spirit. Like unbelievable, right? Like to come up with

340
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:41.570
that list. And but I was always like Wondering How This Made The Top 10.

341
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:52.320
And the one I sometimes have a problem with is this one. It's Exodus 20:16 and Exodus 20:16 is a

342
00:52:52.330 --> 00:53:05.710
important verse that I hope they show because I really need to read it. Exodus 20:16. Any time now

343
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:15.570
you must not testify falsely against your neighbor

344
00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:23.670
or in other words version it says you must not bear false witness.

345
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:29.860
And

346
00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:47.770
this is really powerful. It's powerful because it is possible for us and God knows it for us to

347
00:53:47.770 --> 00:54:02.150
distort the truth for us to bear false witness for us to testify falsely put our hand on a book or

348
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.500
before witnesses

349
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.760
and then proceed to line,

350
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:19.440
He knows that this can happen in relationships in business, in families towards each other towards

351
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:29.570
strangers. A false witness can be brought that you've never even met. But somehow they've got

352
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:38.680
something that they've been told. They can say at your trial that can secure the win for the other

353
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:48.480
side. And I want you to know that you wouldn't be alone in having to have gone through this. Because

354
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:57.600
before you did, Jesus already did. He lived it. He went through it. A lot of people came and and

355
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:05.970
bore false witness against him. And what happens in this situation, Jesus knows this in Exodus 2016

356
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:11.320
is that it is possible for us to use the truth to war against the truth.

357
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:23.790
And so someone can comment and say something even out of context. It is true that Jesus said it, but

358
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:33.960
that's not what he meant. And they will use that truth to war against that, which is true. And so

359
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:40.220
they took Jesus' words and what he said and where he said it and the reason why he said it, that was

360
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:48.260
left out and they used it against him in his trial and they bore false witness. And there are times

361
00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:54.560
when we can do the same thing, we can say, well, you said this, knowing very well that that's not

362
00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:00.820
how it was meant. But we use it, we manipulate it and we use it as power against the other person

363
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:08.360
and we do that because it is more important in that instance that we win rather than be true.

364
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:16.710
The reason there is a difference between a lie and a truth is not because God is so focused and

365
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:21.860
obsessed on what is right and wrong, but so that we could all become trustworthy.

366
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:30.850
It's about who we are and who he wants us to become. You see, God has put us on a journey and he's

367
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.210
put a compass in us,

368
00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:44.830
the compass of truth so that we could and would become trustworthy. Can we say amen to that? God

369
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.400
wants us to be trustworthy.

370
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:54.430
And that's why you'll never hear someone say, man, I don't know what's wrong with me. I have got way

371
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:55.440
too much integrity.

372
00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:05.340
I gotta shed some of this, man. It's just like weighing me down. Like it's just like such a burden to

373
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:11.730
be this integral all the time. Like you can't imagine what it's like to be me so full of integrity

374
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:19.530
that no matter where I go. You know what we're seeing a lie and figuring out which troop, you know,

375
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:24.580
there's some things that you just can't have too much of a good thing of and and definitely

376
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:35.780
integrity is not one of them trust. Worthiness is the objective in all of this. My mom used to have

377
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.200
this thing where she'd say look me in the eye

378
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:47.080
and now tell me again and she was trying to you know, catch catch the light, I thought I was like,

379
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:56.860
you know what's this old lady gonna do against my astute powers of deceit and manipulation. And so

380
00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:01.110
my mom would like say look at me in the iron and I don't know what it was, but I would cave every

381
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:09.270
time. She was so good, she must have been like trained in World War Two by the fascist regime to

382
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:16.430
like illicit confessions because all she had to do was just look at me, my italian mother just look

383
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:22.040
in my eyes, I would just like crumble, I would just confess the truth. But as I got older that

384
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:29.590
stopped working, I got I got better at my storytelling, I got better at my lives, I got better at my

385
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:37.980
deceit and she said look me in the eye and I go that's not gonna work anymore and it wouldn't and

386
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.670
then my mom came up with this phrase,

387
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:48.420
is this lie the truth? Oh man, she ordered me like right there,

388
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:59.010
you know, she she just took me and she schooled me because in that moment I didn't know what to say

389
00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:14.630
is this lie the truth. I'm gonna say yes, this is a question in which you cannot answer yes to you,

390
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:23.410
see what you did here she's saying, I can't prove it, but I know you're a liar,

391
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:33.210
I can't bring any evidence to prove it. But I know you're lying to me.

392
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:44.150
And in that moment, in that moment, guess what happens? In that moment I become evasive, I'm

393
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:50.800
laughing, I'm doing everything possible to not have to answer the question. And since I didn't take

394
00:59:50.800 --> 01:00:02.310
Jesus master class, like No one is convinced, I am not doing well in this scenario. And the truth is

395
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:10.540
none of us are. Here's what we know about lying. It makes us sick. You hold onto a lie. You get sick,

396
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:17.540
you get sick in your soul, you get sick in your spirit. It brings physical illness to you. It will

397
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:25.700
bring things that are not genetically possible, but are spiritually possible because you are lying

398
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:33.220
and you will not face the truth. And what God is trying to do is he's trying to free us from all

399
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:38.030
that. He's like, I don't want you to live your life in the shadows. I don't want you to live in the

400
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:44.570
darkness. I don't want you to have to live with a lie. I don't want you to be defined or discovered

401
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:50.940
as a liar. I want you, I want you to experience truth.

402
01:00:53.190 --> 01:01:03.360
And the reason is because God has designed us for truth. Can we say amen God has designed us for

403
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:03.980
truth.

404
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.290
I'm gonna wrap this up with one more verse And it's found in Genesis chapter three verse five. And

405
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:18.260
and it says that God knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it, and you will be like

406
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:27.740
God and you will know both good and evil. And it's like the first like lie and manipulation that we

407
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:35.400
see in the scriptures. And it's it's satan and satan in this story is a fallen angel who rebelled

408
01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:41.900
against God and now has been cast to the earth and and God is giving humanity choices and he gives

409
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:48.590
the first humans choice. He gives them the opportunity to either believe and trust in him or to

410
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:57.580
believe the lie and the deceiver and follow his words instead. And and the scriptures show us that

411
01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:05.660
satan or devil means slander, the one who lies about you, the one who opposes you. And we see that

412
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:13.160
from this moment that the battle is always about truth, and Satan is always doing the exact same

413
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:20.040
thing. He's lying to you. He's lying to me. He's lying to us. He's distorting our understanding of

414
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.770
God and doing everything possible for us to just stay trapped in a lie rather than experience the

415
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:32.420
power of the truth. And even though we may gain in knowledge and our understanding of good and evil

416
01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:38.630
may increase, There is only one thing that can truly make us good and that is the truth that comes

417
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:42.780
from the source that is true, and that is God himself.

418
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:52.270
And so if we turn to God and we turn to him as that source, then here's what's gonna happen. We're

419
01:02:52.270 --> 01:03:02.220
gonna follow where the truth takes us? And God isn't just leading you there, He isn't just leading

420
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:11.220
you to the truth. He is there he is the truth. And if we go to God, here's what's gonna happen,

421
01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:22.190
Every lie will always be unmasked. Every plan that the enemy has will be revealed. Every strategy

422
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:29.470
that people have made in secret to take you out to separate you and to bring destruction into your

423
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:36.380
life. Those plans will not succeed over and over again. We see when we remain faithful to that,

424
01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:46.310
which is true to that, which is truth. That God always helps that person prevail gives them the

425
01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:54.410
victory time and time and time again. And God will do it for you to you believe that you believe

426
01:03:54.410 --> 01:04:01.250
that for you. So the time we just put the lies and the deceit and the manipulation and all that

427
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:09.520
stuff just put it behind us and just be bears of that, which is truth and of that, which is true.

428
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:11.530
God bless you guys thank you so much.

429
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:23.010
Hey, would you guys stand as we would pray together and the band's gonna come back up in the moment

430
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:30.990
and they're gonna sing the song. Yes, he can uh one more time and I'm just so glad that we can have

431
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:38.900
this moment together and and this is a powerful moment for us as we turn our attention to God and we

432
01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:46.700
say God, would you direct my life to that which is true to that which is truth. Would you transform

433
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:55.430
me by that truth? Would you change me from the inside out? This is an opportunity for God to just

434
01:04:55.430 --> 01:05:05.600
show the things that maybe you know, we have just ignored or or purposely just stayed away from that

435
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:12.900
God would help us to confront our own lives, our own deceit. So it starts with us and here's where I

436
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:18.120
want you to go with this. Okay? I know that you've been lied to and I know that there's the seat

437
01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.910
around you and there will be tomorrow probably as well. But here's here's what I want you to

438
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:31.200
understand. This is not this moment is not about other people. This moment is about you. It's what

439
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:39.410
God wants to show you. It's about the truth that he wants you to see. And and if you stand in front

440
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:49.530
of the truth, would you truly recognize it? It's about your essence becoming true. And so we pray

441
01:05:49.540 --> 01:06:02.130
father, thank you that you are not just around but you are with us. You walk with us, you love us,

442
01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:12.720
you hold us, you carry us are in us and you are forever there for us. And even in this moment as we

443
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:20.640
find ourselves before you would you help us to see the truth that we need to see and to experience

444
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:30.130
the change that you need us to have and we pray this in Jesus' name Amen. Amen. Thanks for praying

445
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:38.010
that with me. I really appreciate that. And so let's sing this song and then I'll be right back

446
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.000
after it. Okay, thank you.

475
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.070
Thanks God. Thank you. Amen.

476
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:23.630
Yes, he can. He can make us a people of truth. And I'm so glad that we can become truths sayers

477
01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.850
and not just storytellers. Well, God bless you guys thanks for a great Sunday for being together. I

478
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:34.640
hope we can get together again. And in the coming weeks, remind you that in two weeks time we are

479
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:40.610
having our welcome back Sunday with inflatables and games and food for all ages and all sizes. It's

480
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:48.780
gonna happen right here inside this space that we meet in. Thank you again for your generosity for

481
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:55.580
your participation in the ministries here at River's Edge for our volunteers each and every week,

482
01:10:55.590 --> 01:11:01.660
including those that volunteer as leaders of belong groups. And if you're looking for a way to

483
01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:10.650
connect with people your age and be a part of a community that is about more than just yourself, but

484
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:16.710
about making a difference in the lives of others, then see me about connecting in a belong group and

485
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:24.560
they meet all over the city. There are great ways for you to really discover more about God yourself,

486
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:29.450
but also to make some incredible friendships. And so I look forward to see you guys. Next Sunday
