00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.270
To him even silence is praise

2
00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:01.710
for in him was created the universe of things, both in the heavenly realm and on the earth, all that

3
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:12.080
is seen and unseen. He is the divine portrait, the true likeness of the invisible God. He rides

4
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:22.680
across the heavens to help you, across the skies in majestic splendor. For he is the one all of

5
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:35.000
humanity comes before with amazing wonders and with awe inspiring displays of power. Everyone

6
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:43.890
everywhere looks to him for he is the confidence of all the earth.

7
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:05.940
Would you stand with me as we get ready to worship? And I am so excited for today. Not just our time

8
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:15.140
together in worshiping, singing these songs, but the message that God has given us today and how

9
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:25.440
it's going to speak to our life situation, how we're going to be able to enjoy this moment because

10
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.870
we've come in hungry for God and not just hungry for the brunch. Right? I know we're hungry for the

11
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:40.520
brunch and we can smell it, but that's the anticipation of things to come right. And it's kind of

12
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.400
like that with God is that he gives us the aromas in life that kind of point us in the direction of

13
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.320
the amazing things that he has in store for us. And I want you to take these moments that God is

14
00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:00.100
offering us right now and see where they're leading us, where they're going to bring us the things

15
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:09.970
that God is going to show us and reveal to us. And so we are in this new message today. It's called

16
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:17.500
the armor of God and we are going to experience together what it looks like to have the invisible

17
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:25.680
armor of God upon our lives. We also want you to know that you belong. You already belong. And no

18
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.160
matter where you are on your spiritual journey, we want to welcome you and know that God has

19
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:37.190
incredible things in store for you. But right now we're gonna worship together And this first song

20
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:43.190
is gonna be led by Monica. She leads us into this song called Way Maker. Let's worship together.

21
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.910
Amen.

22
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:53.470
Good morning. Good morning. So beautiful to see you all here. Let's sing these words together.

80
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:23.230
I love how you guys just knew it was time to sit. You like you guys are not just beautiful on the

81
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:30.030
inside, on the outside, but you've got brains too. You're the full package. That's awesome. Hey, we

82
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.990
are so excited that you are with us today. We've got some announcements we want to share with you

83
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:40.110
before we continue with the rest of the gathering. And the first being that of course this is

84
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:47.820
remembered state weekend and we want to remember our heroes had a grandfather who fought in World

85
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:54.500
War Two and I have cousins who served in the military, friends who are in the military. I'm sure

86
00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:01.540
many of you have a similar story. And we want to thank God for the freedom that they fought for on

87
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:08.060
our behalf and the opportunity that it has given us to live in this free country today. And we also

88
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:15.780
want to give you guys just a quick recap of the amazing worship night that we had right here on

89
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:22.060
Friday night. We had this event called United Church and we had a band that was comprised of young

90
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:29.410
adults from different churches and then we opened it up to the community and we packed this place up.

91
00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.910
It was amazing, it was just a great night.

92
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:41.120
It was just oh yeah, there's a photo right there and uh it was just amazing to see so many people

93
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:47.030
come out for that and it's the first one that we've been able to do of course, like many things that

94
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:53.660
stop because of the pandemic, it was great to have this happen again on that Remembrance day and we

95
00:23:53.660 --> 00:24:02.040
had a wonderful opportunity to also take communion together and we were able to also remember our

96
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:09.480
hero, Jesus and how he gave his life, how he sacrificed everything so that we could live in the

97
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:16.680
freedom of a new life Amen. And so we give thanks for that as well. And today we want to remind you

98
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.320
that if you took Christmas boxes last Sunday, this Sunday was the Sunday to bring them back and in

99
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:29.400
case you forgot and in case you're not ready to return them well I need you to speak to to lead a,

100
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.620
at the end of the gathering and she's I'm gonna give you some locations of where you can drop them

101
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:41.460
off yourself and so we are one of the places that is collecting them but we need to get these to

102
00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:48.530
them this week. So between Monday and this coming Friday, I believe that is the drop off for the

103
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:57.260
Christmas boxes and so happy to, to say that we have given out almost 100 boxes, just our community

104
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:05.380
of faith, not amazing. So almost 100 boxes and so we want to see them all come back and all just go

105
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:11.620
to these kids and um and so that they can experience some, some good news this Christmas season

106
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:17.840
today at the end of the gathering, we're not having our typical after party because our community

107
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:27.290
kitchen, that has been once again active since the month of, I guess June July as they've been

108
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:34.600
getting things ready and then prepping the kitchen and getting it all prepared for what comes next.

109
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.820
And our first meal that we did here was in September, our second one was in October and now this is

110
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:46.420
our third meal which is happening today at the end of the gathering and we're talking about

111
00:25:46.420 --> 00:26:02.140
scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes, muffins and so much more. Aren't you excited for the

112
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:08.050
brunch at the end of the gathering, come on. So that's gonna happen right after the gathering. I

113
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:13.790
want to thank our community kitchen and their team and all the work that they've put into this as we

114
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:20.590
get ready for the next steps and we'll be able to share more with you in the next little while, but

115
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:25.030
we have four ways for you to be able to give that up there on the screen and we just thank you for

116
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:32.340
your ongoing giving and donations and generosity that makes all of this possible, including what

117
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:39.680
we're going to be um just enjoying together for brunch. Well we have the video that we're gonna show

118
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:45.880
right now, that's for our kids to be able to go, kids, you're dismissed. So as the video plays kids,

119
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:54.580
you can go to the annex for your program and thank you for the teachers today, that are gonna take

120
00:26:54.580 --> 00:27:01.760
the kids and teach them God's word and inspire them to live for Jesus. Can we thank our teachers

121
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.620
this morning?

122
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.840
Good stuff! Alright.

123
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.610
So we've got this series that we're in right now, it's gonna be something that I'm gonna figure out

124
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:58.780
as we go. Uh yesterday I found myself in Toronto, thanks to Peter who made it possible for me to fly

125
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:04.720
with him. Uh and we went to Toronto so I could do a chapel last night for the Montreal Alouettes at

126
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.200
their hotel, at the Western Harbor. And they are not a sponsor, by the way, I don't know why I

127
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.000
mentioned the hotel name, but uh

128
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:21.030
but I don't know just the things that are in my head. Um And so I did the chapel last night. And um

129
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.760
and then we had a great time with the guys and I got them all excited and pumped for what God's

130
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:34.130
gonna do at the game today, just later on at one o'clock. And uh and then if if they win today uh

131
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:40.090
then next week I'm gonna have to accompany them to to regina. So I don't know what that's gonna look

132
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:45.110
like but and they'll be in the Gray Cup and I've never been to regina anybody been to Saskatchewan

133
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:53.210
before. Yeah. Oh so many hands. That's so shocking to me actually. Okay anybody from Saskatchewan?

134
00:28:54.530 --> 00:29:03.080
No way Patty wow, I had no idea. Okay so I'm not gonna say anything bad about it then. So

135
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.870
So we'll see how that works out but I'm excited to go and uh and and of course it's going to be the

136
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:17.930
Great Cup and and the last time the alouettes were in it just so you guys are aware was was like the

137
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:25.330
eastern final was here in Montreal and there was 60,000 fans at the Olympic Stadium. And it was in

138
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:34.460
2012. And that was my actually my my first year as a chaplain for the alouettes and the last play of

139
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:44.050
the game, Anthony Calvillo throws a touchdown pass to Brian Bratton, it bounces off his numbers as

140
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:53.460
he was screened a little bit by the D. B. and we lost 27-20. And this is the first time in 10 years

141
00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:01.300
that we're back in the Eastern final. That's how long I have been the chaplain of the Alouettes and

142
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.220
how terrible a job have obviously been doing

143
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:15.710
and not inspiring anyone to victory. So I don't know how this this is gonna go, but it'll be

144
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:22.190
interesting to see what happens later today. If you can say a prayer for the Alouettes and maybe it

145
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:29.210
will redeem my career as a chaplain uh as well. Let's watch this clip and we'll get started with

146
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.040
today's message.

147
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.790
I think there's this concept of winning and losing that we're all very familiar with. I think that

148
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:10.360
if we talk about times in our life when we felt that we've won, uh you know, we would be, I think

149
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.550
beaming probably from ear to ear, we would be smiling, We would be talking about it with such

150
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:24.670
enthusiasm about how we overcame and had obstacles and challenges, but none of those things

151
00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:32.040
prevented us from experiencing the Sweet cup of Victory. And we talk about those victorious moments,

152
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:39.750
like they are so ever fresh in our minds and we can sometimes embellish the details as well. Every

153
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:46.290
time we tell the story, it gets a little bit more interesting and a little bit more exciting and

154
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:52.980
definitely possibly even uh you know, a little bit more dramatic in in terms of the outcome and how

155
00:31:52.980 --> 00:32:03.450
it all plays out uh in our minds, but the reality is also that we have experienced heavy losses and

156
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:11.000
I think that those heavy losses have weighed on us probably a lot more than the winning has impacted

157
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.860
us. And if I think back on my life, I not only remember the losses more, but I feel like they've

158
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:27.850
impacted me more. I've not only learned from those losses, but I feel like I'm sometimes still

159
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:35.880
reliving them and experiencing the trauma and the tragedy of of those losses in my life. But there's

160
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:44.390
something about God that tells me and reminds me that I can not only overcome these losses but that

161
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:56.230
I can experience victory in a way and at a level and in a sphere of my life where maybe I have just

162
00:32:56.230 --> 00:33:05.660
resigned to the fact that I wasn't going to live a life of victory. Interesting thing about the

163
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:14.510
story that we're in today is that it's a story that we all know so well that we may ignore and even

164
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:25.640
possibly miss the powerful truths that are in it. You guys familiar with the story of of David and

165
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:33.630
Goliath. I'm sure at some point you've heard this story and you've heard this analogy used over and

166
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:44.440
over again, but today I want to speak to you about one aspect in this story that maybe possibly you

167
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:55.570
haven't quite heard enough about and that is the invisible armor in which David wore. I want to

168
00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:03.740
speak to you about this topic because I feel like I'm often out in the world feeling unprotected.

169
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:15.120
I feel super vulnerable to the attacks of not just people, but this world in which we live in by the

170
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:20.600
people who govern it, by the people who have the power in it, by the people who have the money to

171
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:28.210
make the decisions for everyone else. Sometimes I feel extremely vulnerable when I see events

172
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:41.960
happening across the world, wondering what if this comes here? Sometimes I live my life thinking

173
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:49.400
that I'm not just vulnerable to these large events, but I'm I'm vulnerable to these small everyday

174
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:58.620
events, to the simple things of just earning a salary and paying my bills or making up the debt that

175
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:09.950
I've accumulated or just the relationships that I'm in and the conflicts and the compromises that

176
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:21.310
we're constantly making to try to keep things together. The dreams that we may have set aside for

177
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:33.320
the realities that are teaching us and telling us, and sometimes taking from us our hopes for a

178
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:44.200
better future and in all of these circumstances and situations, we find ourselves vulnerable. I want

179
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:52.890
you to see that in this story, David was seen as the least and the most vulnerable in his own family.

180
00:35:53.490 --> 00:36:01.360
And yet when God saw him, he didn't see that at all. In fact, even when David looked at himself,

181
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:09.080
while no one respected him and saw him as even having any potential to do anything great ever in his

182
00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:19.830
life. That is not how David saw himself. And it's a reminder of how our relationship with God is so

183
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:31.130
important because it changes the way that we see ourselves and if we are to depend on what is around

184
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:44.130
us or who is with us, then we will find ourselves always feeling vulnerable and unprepared for what

185
00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:51.230
is coming next. And I believe that God doesn't want that for you, doesn't want that for me, doesn't

186
00:36:51.230 --> 00:37:00.170
want that for any of us. And so we're gonna read a few verses that are gonna shine this important

187
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:10.170
light on this topic right now. Well, in 1st Samuel 17 and in verse 32, it says, don't worry about

188
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:22.670
this Philistine David told Saul: I'll go fight him. And it's amazing that in this first verse, David

189
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:37.950
is free of worry. He is empty of all concern. He is going in with full confidence. And yet no one in

190
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:47.860
his entire country, including his king, possesses anything resembling the confidence that David has

191
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:56.590
in this moment. And I can tell you that right from the start, we see that David's confidence is not

192
00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.660
in himself, but it is in something greater.

193
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:12.100
And then Saul says to him, don't be ridiculous. And I believe that there are moments in our lives

194
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:22.290
where we just look ridiculous when we speak faith in the face of giants. We look ridiculous when we

195
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:29.800
have confidence that we can overcome this, when everything is speaking to the fact that we are

196
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:39.430
already defeated. We look ridiculous when we speak of victory. When it's clear that we've already

197
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:51.860
lost. It makes no sense to be someone like David is in this story. Like we can be in our life when

198
00:38:51.870 --> 00:39:01.300
everything is speaking to the defeat instead of the battle that actually has already been won.

199
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:15.230
And when David steps into this tent, I imagine that belongs to the king and stood before the king

200
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:26.950
and he has the audacity to say, don't worry, I got this. Of course Saul is gonna come back and say,

201
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:39.250
don't be ridiculous. Like I like the attitude kid. But let's be honest here, like you have no place

202
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:52.120
in this tent, no place in this fight. There's no way that you can be here right now. And that's what

203
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:59.010
he says. There's no way you can fight this Philistine and possibly win. And then the first thing he

204
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:09.650
does is that he mentions his age, he says, you're, you're a boy and he's a man and and he's a man of

205
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:19.220
war since his youth. It's like you're going into a cage fight dude and you have no chance of winning.

206
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:26.720
There's no way you're gonna come out of this alive. You are completely unprepared. I want to tell

207
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:33.690
you something right now. There's never been a situation in my life that I've ever gone into that. I

208
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:40.130
have felt completely prepared for. I'll tell you that even as I walked into that hotel last night

209
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:49.290
and had to give a chapel which I have done over and over again, I was failed with the nervousness

210
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:55.740
that comes with having to speak on on God's behalf and share his word and bring insights that can

211
00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:04.070
possibly change a person's life that even in a moment in which I have done it over and over and over

212
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:16.530
again, just like today in this place, I feel that same desire to throw up all over this stage. I

213
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:24.860
won't because I've learned to hold that stuff back, push that stuff down and make it through, but

214
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:34.010
it's still there and I'll tell you that the moment, it isn't is the moment I am most afraid because

215
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:41.160
it is the moment that I know that I am relying on myself instead of the God who put me in that

216
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.160
position,

217
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:56.530
in that very place to do something on his behalf. My confidence can't come from my repetition. It

218
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.150
has to come from my representation of the king

219
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:07.980
and you have to believe that for yourself. And so in that moment that David steps into the situation,

220
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:14.140
David persisted. He goes, I've been taking care of my father's sheep and goats. What a resume.

221
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:23.150
Imagine even bothering to say something like that. Like, what is he doing? Are you trying to get

222
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:28.800
yourself killed in the king's tent because this is gonna do it. It's like, come on, that's your

223
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:38.990
resume. You took care of cute sheep and goats? Like really, that's it? And he says, then he goes on

224
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:43.460
to explain. He goes, but you don't understand. Wait, wait, wait, let me explain. He's like there was

225
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:52.040
a lion and a bear and they came to steal from the flock. Ah this is what I did. I went after it with

226
00:42:52.040 --> 00:43:00.150
a club and I rescued the lamb from its mouth and then if the animal even turned on me I'd catch it

227
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:07.660
by the jaw and I would club it to death. And he goes, I've done this. And then he says, plural. I've

228
00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.160
done this to both lions and bears

229
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:20.680
and I'll do it to this pagan Philistine too because he has done something. He has defied the armies

230
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:29.350
of the living God and the Lord who rescued me from the claws of the Lion and the bear will rescue me

231
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:36.510
from this Philistine. And then Saul finally consented. Alright, go ahead, he said, and may the Lord

232
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:46.400
be with you. And then Saul gave David his own armor a bronze helmet and a coat of mail, which is

233
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:55.540
like not a coat from Canada Post. It's it's like mail meaning like it's made out of metal. And

234
00:43:55.550 --> 00:44:03.330
and then David put it on and and then he strapped a sword over it and he took a step or two to see

235
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:10.810
what it was like because he had never looked at this, he had never worn such things. And then he

236
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:19.880
says, I can't go on these, I'm not used to them. And David took them off again and the Bible says

237
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:26.400
that he went and he picked up five smooth stones from a stream and he put them into his shepherd's

238
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:33.710
bag and then armed only with his shepherd's staff and sling, he started across the valley to fight

239
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:43.620
the Philistine. David who relied on his experience as a shepherd. Not so much, but more on his

240
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:54.880
relationship with God. I want us to see that this moment is really about how David was a shepherd

241
00:44:54.890 --> 00:45:07.980
with invisible armor. He took it off, he took off what sol had given him. And I believe that Saul is

242
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:17.860
a king who is just lost. What it means to be the king of God's people. He's lost his way. And the

243
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:25.540
only way that he knows how to rule is the way that a king should rule. The way that every other king

244
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:34.000
rules over his people. And so instead of Saul being a king who would rule after God's own heart, the

245
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.130
way that God would want him to rule Saul has just become a king like all the others. And so of

246
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:50.840
course, when enemies come, Saul is gonna do what everyone else does in a moment like this, he's

247
00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:57.400
gonna look for a warrior, he's gonna look for someone who's gonna come out and fight the Philistines

248
00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:04.760
in the time, in which this battle is being fought. It's interesting to note that there are no

249
00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:13.050
workers of steel and no steel to be found by the Israelites, None of this are resources that are

250
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:20.830
available to them. They are owned and monopolized by the Philistines, the only thing that the

251
00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:28.760
Israelites actually have our farm instruments and every time they need those instruments sharpened,

252
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:35.050
they have to bring them to the Philistines and they get charged three quarters of a shackle, which

253
00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:44.780
is an extremely high price for what was being done. And so not only are they constantly under

254
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:54.790
the weight of an enemy, but they don't even have any means to fight him.

255
00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:00.000
And so when they go into this battle,

256
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:09.540
Of course no one wants to go against the people who have the steel who have the swords and the

257
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:21.770
spears and who at this time were known to have over 3000 chariots. They were so outnumbered in every

258
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:29.870
possible way that there was no Israelite among them who would want to go and face even one soldier,

259
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:38.770
let alone all the others. And so if you've ever wondered why there was only one giant who was

260
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.930
taunting the entire Israelite army. Now, you understand why?

261
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:54.090
And this is important context because when David decides to go into battle and he doesn't have any

262
00:47:54.090 --> 00:48:07.090
armor, he's okay with going down to the stream and just getting five smooth stones for his slingshot.

263
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:19.090
And what this reminds us is that David is someone whose entire dependence is on God and he learned

264
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:26.120
that total dependence on God. He learned that total dependence on God when he was out alone in the

265
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:33.460
hillside as a shepherd. And it was in those moments that David not only learned to pray, but it was

266
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:41.970
in those moments where he learned to play music, where he wrote the psalms. And so what we see is a

267
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:52.410
shepherd who is completely reliant on God through prayer and worship and isn't afraid to go up

268
00:48:52.420 --> 00:49:02.630
against a giant because his confidence is not in his profession, his experience or his weaponry. His

269
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:05.770
confidence is in his relationship with God.

270
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:15.470
And when you have that kind of relationship with God, you will go out into any situation and you

271
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:25.660
believe wholeheartedly that not only is God with you, but God is going to fight for you. It was in

272
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:33.500
those moments that David learned humility where shepherds were not respected in his day. His

273
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:43.120
brothers even mocked him when he showed up at the field that day. They were so disrespectful to him.

274
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:52.110
They were making fun of him saying thanks for bringing us our lunch. And you know that shepherds in

275
00:49:52.110 --> 00:50:00.310
that day were not even respected enough for their own testimony to be validated in the court of law.

276
00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:08.670
And yet Jesus shows up to shepherds on his birth. And he does that to demonstrate that there is no

277
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:16.730
one in his kingdom, not anyone who is not worthy of, not only seeing him knowing him, but then also

278
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.960
declaring him to the world.

279
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:32.470
Everything is tied in everything means something. And the scriptures tell us that he learned to be

280
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:41.340
skillful, not with what he didn't have, but what he did have, not with what wasn't in his hand, but

281
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:52.040
what was. And so the five smooth stones or reflection of his mastery over the slingshot and how he

282
00:50:52.040 --> 00:51:00.440
had confidence that he could go into any battle, no matter what it was with what he had become

283
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:09.820
skillful with, he didn't have to wear Saul's armor because he already had one of his own. God is not

284
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:15.740
asking you to be someone, you're not, he's not asking you to acquire skills that you don't have,

285
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:25.010
he's able to use you the way you are, where you're at right now with who he and with what he has

286
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:26.810
already interested you with.

287
00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:35.120
And when David gets called into battle, he doesn't go to some dojo and train for six months.

288
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:43.600
He doesn't go and through this this exercise of like stabbing straw soldiers.

289
00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:52.070
He doesn't learn how to fight like a gladiator, although that would have been a really cool part in

290
00:51:52.070 --> 00:52:03.900
this story, but it's not there. He just goes as himself and it's ridiculous. God is saying, I want

291
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:13.150
you to go as yourself. And when everyone else says it's ridiculous, know this: the battle has already

292
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:16.230
been won. Can we say Amen to that? Come on.

293
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:28.100
See David learns that he can take off Saul's armor because he's got something else. He has invisible

294
00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:40.000
armor, he has invisible armor, invisible armor and he's able to fight bears and and he's able to

295
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:50.440
fight lions and win because he's got this invisible armor wherever it is that he goes. He discovers

296
00:52:50.450 --> 00:53:01.290
that he has this with him always. My uncle was a tailor, not just an average taylor. He was probably

297
00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:09.900
one of the best tailors on Jean Talon Street in the East End of Montreal and people would go to him

298
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:18.070
and pay big money to make him make his suits. And my uncle wasn't the owner of this shop, he was

299
00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.240
just the tailor in it.

300
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:31.020
And he used to make suits for his sons that anybody would envy when those boys walked into church,

301
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:39.510
people knew those boys there. So look at those suits. The tailoring was always impeccable, the

302
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:47.810
material, the highest quality and on and on. And then I'm was able with my brothers to inherit those

303
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:56.030
suits never had a suit tailored for me. But my mom was a seamstress and so she would take my

304
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:03.720
cousin's hand me down suits and she would adjust them to me when my cousins were done with them

305
00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:09.480
because they had outgrown them. And because they were older than I and my brothers, we were able to

306
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.480
pass those things down. My, my son is still wearing one of those suits, by the way. No, I'm just

307
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:25.140
joking, but it would have been a cool story. But but the point is that those suits were always hand

308
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:35.250
me downs and no matter how good you feel and look in a suit. It's always a little disappointing when

309
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:39.100
someone comes up to you and says, oh wow, this is my old suit.

310
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:49.360
Yeah, it was, yeah, thanks for saying that in front of my friends. Yeah, appreciate that.

311
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:57.170
Whatever moment I thought in that moment of looking good and feeling good and looking somewhat cool

312
00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:04.340
is gone forever and that would happen all the time. Someone would recognize it and compliment and

313
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:11.320
say, oh wow, you look so good in this that you know belong to your cousin. And and it got to the

314
00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.820
point where I finally was graduating high school and my mom surprised me and she did something that

315
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:25.540
was completely unexpected. She walked into my uncle's shop where he worked and my uncle didn't even

316
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:32.740
know this was happening and she said today I am buying my son his suit

317
00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:39.460
and I meant it still brings me to tears because I know how much money she dropped that day, the

318
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:45.200
money that I don't know how she had collected and saved and the things that she had to have done to

319
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:53.110
make that possible. And my uncle was just so in shock he didn't know how to respond. And my mom said,

320
00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.680
you see all the materials that are in this shop, I want you to just just choose whichever one you

321
00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:05.180
want. And I don't know how he managed to do it. But I walked over to the most expensive cloth in the

322
00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:10.140
place and my uncle is right in my ear and he's saying not that one,

323
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:20.880
not that one. And and I I'm like but this is the one that I like, I wasn't getting it, this is the

324
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.560
one that I want. And he's like not that one, your mother doesn't have the money for that, not that

325
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:32.310
one. I was like, oh and my mother hears it and she goes, no, no, no, if that's the one my son wants,

326
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:40.350
that's the one he's gonna get. And my uncle made me a suit. That was the first time I understood

327
00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:47.110
would have felt to have like invisible armor. Like when I was to put that suit on. Like I mean I

328
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:52.470
just felt like wow, it wasn't just the fact that my uncle had made it, but the sacrifices that my

329
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:59.450
mom had made for me to have it. It was, it was like she had given up so much for me to be able to

330
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:05.300
just feel good. I know what you know what it looks like to to buy something and feel good in it to

331
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:12.170
look good in it and and how that feeling fades sometimes. But when I tell the story today, I can

332
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:14.940
assure you that feeling has not faded

333
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:25.850
that suit means to me more today than it did even on the day that it was made for me. And I can tell

334
00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:35.620
you that what we don't sometimes understand is the sacrifice that God has made to give us all an

335
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:44.290
invisible suit of armor. Can we say amen to that? Like it's just there and and Saul gives him his,

336
00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:51.130
he gives him his best. The reason it sells a helmet of bronze because he wants, he wants everyone to

337
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:59.860
know I'm giving him my best. But guess what? It doesn't fit and when the armor doesn't fit, it's

338
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:09.400
because it was never meant for you, it was never meant for you. But God has an invisible armor that

339
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:18.430
is fit just for you. It is custom made. He made it just for you and you are to go out into the world

340
00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:28.800
with that armor because someone else's armor cannot protect you and you've got to take it off,

341
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:38.020
You've got to leave it behind. Someone else's armor cannot protect you. Someone else's armor is

342
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:45.820
always gonna be too heavy. It's gonna be too heavy for you to be able to walk in. The Bible says

343
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:53.080
that David took steps and he said that it was too heavy, it was too uncomfortable. He said, I cannot

344
00:58:53.080 --> 00:59:03.210
go in these, it wasn't made for him because someone else's armor is too heavy. You cannot wear what

345
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:13.740
someone else has had made for them. It's got to fit you. Someone else's armor is always gonna limit

346
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:21.400
your freedom. There is no way that you are gonna be able to do everything that God has called you to

347
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:29.690
do. You cannot go into battle and not be able to walk the way that he has asked you to walk to

348
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:36.820
present yourself the way that he has called on you to show up on that day in that moment. For that

349
00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:45.260
reason, you cannot allow someone else's armor to limit your freedom and you cannot allow someone

350
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:53.680
else's armor to prevent the victory. And when David recognized this, he just set it aside and he

351
00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.740
went back to the slingshot and he went to just wearing the clothes that he had walked into that tent

352
00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:05.770
that day and he was okay with just taking the stones that he would need to go into battle. And the

353
01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:11.450
Bible describes that when he goes into battle, he's not just going in against Goliath, but he's

354
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:19.250
going in prepared that in case his brothers show up, he's got stones for them too. five stones for

355
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:31.220
five giants. One shot for each. That's how confident he was in God and in what he had been given as

356
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:38.970
invisible armor, confident in his slingshot, confident in his aim, confident in how he had been

357
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:47.010
given the victory time and time again, confident in how God had shown up and given him victories

358
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:52.680
over lions and bears that he knew that if he went against this giant, it was just a bigger animal.

359
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:59.420
It didn't matter who it was what it was, it didn't matter what it was called. Didn't matter where it

360
01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:05.090
was from, didn't matter how much experience it had, didn't matter that he couldn't even probably

361
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:12.500
carry or lift that dude sword, it just mattered that he was going into it knowing that his invisible

362
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:18.700
armor was going to be enough. You know what it says about armor in the Bible and Ephesians chapter

363
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:27.570
six verse 10 and 11, It says this, I give you this final word. Be strong in the Lord and in his

364
01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:34.180
mighty power, your confidence is in God, it's not in you, it's not in your strength, but God is

365
01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:40.210
gonna use everything that you are not asking you to be something that you're not and not something

366
01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:48.070
that you do not have. And then it says put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand

367
01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:56.630
firm against all strategies of the devil. God is saying, I'm going to give you an armor that is

368
01:01:56.630 --> 01:02:02.550
gonna protect you every day that you are out there, that when people are scheming against you and

369
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:09.300
when the enemy is laying out traps for you, I'm gonna give you the insight to be able to see it. I'm

370
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:14.210
gonna give you the protection that you need in the moment in which you need it. That you are not

371
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:24.320
going out there vulnerable. You're going out there protected and you are protected with the armor of

372
01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:34.720
God and God says I want you to put that on God will fit you with his invisible armor to help you

373
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.990
live fearlessly. Do you believe that he wants you to live fearlessly like David did. He went in

374
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:52.980
there so confident not in himself, but in God and the invisible armor that God had put on him and

375
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:58.250
that's the confidence that we need to go out into the world with today. Amen. God bless you guys.

376
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.160
Thank you so much.

377
01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:13.400
I'm gonna ask you to stand. We're gonna sing that song. This is how I love to thank the Lord. And as

378
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:19.270
we sing that song, as we conclude this gathering, I want you to think about how God has just helped

379
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:28.400
you through the battles of your life. How he's with you right now. How he wants to give you that

380
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.550
fearlessness through the armor that he has tailor made just for you,

381
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:42.690
that armor that he's gonna put on you and on no one else, because it's made just for you. He's gonna

382
01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:48.470
give you that confidence to go out into the world knowing that you are not vulnerable. You can be

383
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:56.440
fearless, just like David was because no matter what comes against you, it cannot defeat you because

384
01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:04.670
your enemy is already defeated. The battle has already been won. David walked around like the battle

385
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:10.860
was won and I pray that right now, father, you would help us to walk around with that same

386
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:17.980
confidence with the armor that you have put on each of us. Thank you for the way that you have

387
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:26.030
tailor made that armor for us for the way that you have taken everything into consideration, how

388
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:35.760
nothing is wasted and all of it useful for the victory ahead and we pray these things in Jesus name.

389
01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:44.190
Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. Let's sing this song and then right after, as soon as the song ends,

390
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:51.060
I'm not going to come back out. Um, but you can just be dismissed and just line up to get the brunch

391
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:56.810
the food. Um, you can definitely take it with you if you need to go, but you can also feel free to

392
01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:03.060
eat it. Here, is that clear? You can enjoy it here and if you have a spill or something happens,

393
01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:07.370
just find someone will help you clean it up. We'll put it back in your plate and then you can eat it

394
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:14.900
later and I'm just joking. [Five second rule]. I don't know why I say these things. Okay, but just

395
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:20.950
enjoy the brunch. Have a great time. Aren't you glad you're here today. Come on, let's go and thank

396
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:26.280
you to our community kitchen team. They're amazing. They're amazing. God bless you guys.

413
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.740
Praise Your name, hallelujah. Enjoy the brunch. Take care. Bye bye.
