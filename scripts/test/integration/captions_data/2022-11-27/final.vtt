70
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:21.180
journeying with us, uh, since we've been back from uh, the pandemic and finally reopened our doors.

71
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:26.420
It's been quite a journey, quite a battle in so many regards. We're just happy to see the place

72
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:32.960
filling up again and getting back to the place where we can have these seats filled And uh, God

73
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.820
willing in the new year if things continue to trend as they are. Uh, we'd love to have two

74
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.810
gatherings happening. So one at 10 o'clock and one at 12 and so in the new year we're gonna pray

75
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:49.540
that God continues to fill this place up so that we can go to two services. Can I get an amen?

76
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:55.920
Because that's where we used to be. And uh, we definitely want to get back there. So I'm really

77
00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:02.620
excited about this series that we've been in and we are uh really wrapping this one up, we're gonna

78
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:09.210
wrap this one up today and then we're gonna start something new in the weeks to come and it's called

79
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.290
Joyful Expectation, that's gonna be our new series, that's gonna be starting next Sunday, and I

80
00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:23.390
don't want you to miss that. So, but today, we're gonna wrap this one up with a very um obscure

81
00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:29.060
character in the scriptures, someone that you've probably never even heard of and we're gonna be

82
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.800
talking about him in just a few moments. We're gonna read this story first and today we're gonna be

83
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.040
talking about the double edged sword and we're talking about the elements of the armor of God and

84
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:48.390
how those invisible armor that God has given us the invisible armor that God has given us is so

85
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:54.410
important for our understanding of how we can live a victorious life as we face the battles and the

86
00:30:54.410 --> 00:31:00.850
challenges of of everyday life. And so in Judges chapter three, we're gonna begin reading the story

87
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:10.180
here at verse 12 and it starts there once again.

117
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:32.510
Isn't that a great story? It's always great when they win and not a single one of them

118
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:40.450
escapes. But the whole story is just really important to point out key things. And the fact that's

119
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:46.030
most important is that he was a left handed man and it's mentioned twice. So we have to pay

120
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:53.510
attention to that. It's crazy that he escaped down on the train, but he had figured it out that that

121
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:59.070
was the way that he was going to make his way out of there and twice. It also mentions that they

122
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:08.620
passed their idols and so all these things are important and we're going to see why the first thing

123
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:15.320
I need to point out to you in the story is that there is a cycle of slavery that is repeated in the

124
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:23.180
scriptures that we finally understand that we need to avoid in our own lives. Otherwise we keep

125
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:31.170
living the same life that the Israelites lived. It didn't matter when the deliverer would come. Well,

126
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:38.600
the cycle of slavery would begin again. Over and over again. God would have to send a deliverer in

127
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:44.780
the book that we're in. It's called the Book of Judges. And it's a time in which there is no king

128
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:51.150
for Israel. And so God is appointing someone to lead his people. And every once in a while he

129
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:59.770
chooses someone that no one else would choose. And that's pretty much the standard system that God

130
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:07.040
uses over and over again, find someone who is unworthy, someone that everyone else disregards, find

131
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:15.010
someone that no one else would choose. And that's my guy, that's my guy, that's the girl that I'm

132
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:23.280
going to use to deliver my people and over and over God does that and he uses the most unlikely and

133
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:30.410
the most obscure people to do extraordinary things. And and that's important for us to understand

134
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:35.910
that whenever we find ourselves in a position where we feel that we're not good enough, you need to

135
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:43.030
understand right from the start, that God is always looking for someone who's just willing to go and

136
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:48.680
if we're willing to go, then God is willing to go with us. And then that's what we're understanding

137
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:55.330
about this armor of God that's given to all of us. But not everyone is willing to put it on and go

138
00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:01.650
into battle. But if you're willing to put it on and go into battle, then God goes with you, protect

139
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:09.090
you and gives you the victory every time and that's important for us to really allowed to sink in.

140
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:17.260
So, getting back to that cycle of slavery, there is this moment in which the people just experience

141
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:24.130
apostasy where they decide that they are no longer going to believe they're no longer going to

142
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:29.500
follow God, They're just not going to do it. And that's the first stage and then the second stage is,

143
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:35.050
is servitude where God looks at them and says, okay, well if you abandoned me, then I'm not going to

144
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:40.120
be able to protect you from your enemies. Not because I don't want you and not because I don't want

145
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:47.770
to, but because you have abandoned me because you have left the relationship. You have left yourself

146
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:55.090
exposed in this relationship. I protected you as long as I can. But now your enemies are gathering

147
00:38:55.090 --> 00:39:01.940
around you. Whether you realize this or not, they are making plans to come and destroy you. And so

148
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:07.310
Moab you can see that he makes alliances and goes out against the people of Israel. And this is what

149
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:14.200
we need to understand is that we end up in servitude because satan never rests evil, never stops.

150
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:24.160
Darkness, never ceases to exist. It is always gathering to scheme and to bring this death and

151
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:31.710
destruction to our lives. And so because we know this, we know that the opportunity for servitude

152
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:39.630
enslavement of some sort is coming and we have to be aware of that. Now the third thing that happens

153
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:48.860
in the cycle of slavery is supplication supplication, meaning that in the story that we're in, the

154
00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:57.980
people finally cry out, they cry out to God. And then when God hears them crying out, he says, I'm

155
00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:05.420
gonna send you a delivery and that's when he sends Ehud. Ehud would have been probably one of the

156
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:13.510
wealthiest people in, Israel, someone with stature status, he had position, he had power because

157
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:20.820
he's the one who's being chosen and selected to bring the tribute. The tribute is what you have to

158
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:28.770
pay a king from the people that are enslaved. So they collected taxes and they collected gold and

159
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:34.650
silver and whatever it is that they had to bring, whatever the terms of that agreement were, they

160
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:41.270
had to bring that in and Ehud is selected to do this. And the interesting thing is that there is a

161
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:49.830
relationship that Ehud has with God, that he understands that this is going to be his moment where

162
00:40:49.830 --> 00:41:01.890
God is choosing him to put an end to the more bites and he's going to use this moment to do it. The

163
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:09.040
moment that he brings the tribute. And what's powerful about this moment is that Ehud goes back by

164
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:15.770
himself and he hasn't shared his plan with anyone else. It is something that God has put on his

165
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:20.730
heart, something that he is acting on, but it isn't something that he has done in consultation with

166
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:30.160
others. So when he drops off the treasure, he then leaves with everybody, says goodbye to them and

167
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:37.140
then goes back to kill the king. And so that is the third stage supplication and then the fourth

168
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:44.620
stage is salvation. It's God actually delivering his people. And so I don't know about you, but I

169
00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:53.130
feel like we are often in these stages at some point in our relationship with God and our standing

170
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:57.580
of what it looks like to be in relationship with God and we need to just be aware of this, this is a

171
00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:04.920
subtext and it's important because it's repeated over and over again and when whenever we do see

172
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:13.320
anyone in the scriptures crying out to God, God nonetheless response, and I need you to see that

173
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:21.610
because you may feel like you are in a stage in your life where you have abandoned God, where you

174
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:29.760
find yourself in servitude, there's something that has mastery over you, but God is saying if you

175
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:39.780
cry out to me, not only will I hear you, but I will give you the deliverance that you seek, I will

176
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:47.210
give it to you the deliverance that you seek, what you need, I will provide that. And so God wants

177
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:56.710
us to understand that he raises up these deliverers and this deliverer can come to us in whatever

178
00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:05.320
form and fashion that God chooses in the story, he has a name, he is a person, he is left handed and

179
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:15.800
he's incredibly astute in strategy, obviously, very courageous to go and do this and not afraid of

180
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.840
latrines,

181
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:33.340
he is not afraid of having to crawl through, you know what has anyone had to crawl through anything

182
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.970
lately.

183
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:46.620
Have you found yourself in some recently, do you understand what that feels like and looks like, and

184
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:55.930
I want you to understand that in this specific situation, His freedom, his escape is through that

185
00:43:55.930 --> 00:44:05.340
latrine and if you look at the story of that we're in. Not only does this king empty his bowels

186
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:15.490
everywhere, but then he also has to escape through the very place through which he's been emptying

187
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.180
his bowels for a while.

188
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:29.270
And to me if I'm asking God for an escape, I'm asking for it to be cleaner than this, anybody else,

189
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:38.360
I want a clean escape. I don't want this kind of an escape. And here's the problem with us. We want

190
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.490
deliverance without having to crawl through the latrine.

191
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:52.920
We want to be free, but we don't want to struggle for our freedom. We don't want to have to fight

192
00:44:52.930 --> 00:45:02.100
through all the crap that might be there to be able to get clean on the other side. And so the story

193
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:12.080
reminds us that there has to be a decision that is made for us to break that cycle of slavery. And

194
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:22.260
that first decision is we can no longer be content to be enslaved. We have to say I am no longer

195
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:31.090
okay with the way things are. Remember that they had been ruled at this point for 18 years. So this

196
00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:40.290
is a long time coming. And a lot of us have been struggling with things for maybe at least 18 years.

197
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:47.100
Maybe there's things in our life that have been with us even longer than that. And maybe we look at

198
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:53.060
it and we say, you know, I've only been struggling with this for a year and we think it'll never be

199
00:45:53.060 --> 00:46:00.750
us, still struggling with the same thing at year 18, does that make sense? But you see one year

200
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:06.490
becomes a second and becomes a third. And what the story reminds us is that if you leave this

201
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:14.220
unchecked, that if you don't cry out to God, then you can stay in the situation that you're in

202
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:26.530
longer than you ever needed to. Because if we are in servitude, the next stage is supplication. We

203
00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:36.500
have to cry out to God and when we cry out to God, God provides the deliverer and in our case the

204
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:46.240
deliverer is always Jesus and we'll see why. But the deliverance can come to us in many forms and

205
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:54.880
whatever form it comes to us in, Here's the thing, we only give glory to Jesus because he is our

206
00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.250
intercessor, our mediator. He is the one who has heard our cry and he is the one who has given the

207
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:11.360
message to God, who God in turn turns and then sends us the deliverance that we need. And so there's

208
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:20.440
a verse in the book of psalms and it says that we are to no longer be content With being enslaved

209
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:29.130
and Psalm 49:6 says, May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double edge sword in

210
00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:35.040
their hands. Can we say amen to that man? They're singing about this dude and the reason they're

211
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.740
singing about him is because this is such an incredible victory. This figure of the double edged

212
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:51.530
sword is that it's supposed to do two things and and the two things that it's supposed to do is only

213
00:47:51.530 --> 00:48:00.130
understood in the context of what Ehud is explaining and describing in the story that he is living

214
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:07.810
there. There's some reason that when he fashioned that sword, he knew that it needed to have two

215
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:17.220
ends that were sharp And and he went in there wanting to do two things. And then when you're saying,

216
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:27.700
can you just tell us I will. But if I tell you now, it ruins the story because in psalm it reminds

217
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:39.860
us that if we are worshiping God, we are holding the double edged sword in our hands. And I need you

218
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:52.280
to see that when you are worshiping God, it is in that space and in that place where you are not yet

219
00:48:52.290 --> 00:49:01.240
free. And so I worship God and I worship God with a double edged sword in my hand because I say to

220
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:11.070
God in that moment, I no longer want to be enslaved. The second thing is we have to confront the

221
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:18.250
enemy. And when we confront the enemy in Ephesians six verse 17, it says that you are to take the

222
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:27.370
helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. And so what we are doing

223
00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:36.110
is that we are confronting the enemy, but we're confronting the enemy with the word of God, which is

224
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:44.800
the double edged sword. And so what the sword does is that it penetrates the innermost parts of our

225
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.470
being and it executes judgment.

226
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:59.620
And so when we hold the double edged sword in our hand and we're worshiping God, then what we're

227
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:12.440
saying is Lord, I want you to deliver me in the innermost parts of my life that I cannot reach just

228
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:24.340
like Ehud reached the innermost parts of Ehud's fat belly. See the story is connected, see,

229
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:32.450
they're looking at it and they're saying that sword never would have gotten as far as it did, had it

230
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:36.540
not been designed the way that it was,

231
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:48.610
It did two things. It not only killed him on the inside, but then when everything folded back in it

232
00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:59.630
ripped him from the other side, it didn't just reach the innermost parts, but it brought judgment at

233
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:09.550
the same time. But when we are worshiping God, God is saying, I want to deliver you in the innermost

234
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:18.560
parts and the judgment that I bring, it's gonna be a judgment that sets you free. So when we worship

235
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:24.970
God with that double edged sword, we're like Ehud who's been enslaved for 18 years saying no more,

236
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:31.590
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna confront my enemy. And then the third thing that he does is that he says,

237
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:41.490
I'm gonna commit everything to the Lord and in the book of Hebrews, this passage is directly linked

238
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:49.440
to talking about the time in the season of the judges and when the author of Hebrews writes these

239
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:59.880
verses, he's thinking about Ehud and even though he's not mentioned by name, well, his two edged

240
00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:10.030
sword is and so it says that for the word of God is alive and it is powerful and it is sharper than

241
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:19.270
the sharpest two edged sword cutting between soul and spirit between joint and marrow, and it

242
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:26.230
exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. Can we say amen to that? Isn't it amazing how the

243
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:35.110
scriptures are connected, how the story is being alluded to and described and spoken again of again

244
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:45.590
and again in all of these different books. And I want us to see that all of this is possible because

245
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:54.230
God chooses someone Who No one else would have chosen. And so that brings us to understanding who a

246
00:52:54.230 --> 00:53:06.450
who it is and how we all need to accept our potential that God has given each and every one of us,

247
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:18.030
the potential that he sees in us and so accept the potential that God already sees in you. Now, I

248
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:24.550
don't know how down you feel, how discouraged, how unworthy. I don't know what kind of shame you're

249
00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:31.000
carrying, what kind of guilt, what kind of things in your past or in your present are holding you

250
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:39.360
back. But I want you to understand that servitude, that's slavery, it's something that God wants to

251
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:48.100
deliver you from, When God looks at you, he sees someone who is so filled with potential that he

252
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:55.380
wants to release that. But he can only do that if you will cry out to him, worship him. Like we saw

253
00:53:55.390 --> 00:54:05.380
in psalms holding your double edged sword and asking God to divide you soul and spirit joints and

254
00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:12.320
marrow, reaching the innermost parts of your being, setting you free and bringing judgment to the

255
00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:20.680
past once and for all. So you can now live your best life going forward with no regrets. God is

256
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:28.080
saying, I want you to accept this potential and here's what he says in first Corinthians 1 27 he

257
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:34.680
says, But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise God chose the weak things of

258
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:41.770
the world to shame the strong. If you think this is a coincidence, it's not, look, there's been

259
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:49.840
moments where I felt young and and and and and and powerful and strong these days. I feel like I

260
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:56.890
could twist an ankle just getting out of my car. I've been taking boxing lessons every Friday and

261
00:54:56.890 --> 00:55:05.010
it's been it's been like, it has been just boxing the crap out of me. It has been really, really

262
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:12.650
hard. I never thought it would be as hard as it was and as hard as it is. But part of why I keep

263
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:18.320
going is because it's so hard. Does that make sense? I feel like it's it's shaping me. I feel like

264
00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:23.900
it's forming me, I feel like it's doing something in my body and in my mind it's it's that the

265
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:30.460
discipline of having to go when I don't want to go when I'm still sore several days later after it

266
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:37.410
and and to have to go back to it again doesn't seem to make sense. But then I realized that I'm

267
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:43.120
actually getting better, I'm getting stronger that I'm actually more than what I was before I

268
00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:53.130
started going. But it doesn't always feel like that when you are being delivered because the hard

269
00:55:53.130 --> 00:56:03.890
moments are what we always quit at, that's when we give up and we go back to what was comfortable,

270
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:14.360
what was easy? Mhm Why do I need to keep struggling with this and be free when I can stay where I am

271
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:21.970
and just live another day because I've lived another day, every time I've gone back to the way that

272
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:29.080
it was and the people of Israel were in that mindset over and over again, right? They kept seeing

273
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:36.130
hard things in front of them and they kept saying, wouldn't it just be easier for us to just go back?

274
00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:42.710
Why do we have to keep going forward? This is so hard, at least we knew what it was like to live in

275
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:48.410
slavery, let's just go back to that. And if you think that's a mindset that was just the Israelites

276
00:56:48.410 --> 00:57:00.320
you're wrong, I live and fight that mindset all the time. Anybody else. You see Ehud was left handed.

277
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:08.080
And the literal translation of this particular phrase is hindered in the right hand, which is crazy

278
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:18.910
because guess what tribe he's from, he's from the tribe of Benjamin and and and the tribe of

279
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:27.360
Benjamin. Benjamin means son of my right hand. But the problem with a hood is that there was

280
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:35.040
something wrong with his right hand. He actually had a disability that kept him from using it

281
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:41.470
because in those days you would not have used your left hand willingly. Like today, I know this for

282
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:48.860
a fact because my grandmother tied my left hand behind my back when she saw that I started using my

283
00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:57.290
left hand instead of my right. And the day in which I was being raised to be left handed was seen as

284
00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:04.120
a bad thing, anybody else had that in their culture, just Italians are weird to anybody else right?

285
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.740
Like you just couldn't write with your left, you, you just couldn't do that, I couldn't color with

286
00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:13.630
your left, whatever. So to this day I can do everything with both hands because I was always

287
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:19.530
secretly using my left hand. Even when I was in school, they would take everything out of my left

288
00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:23.920
hand and put it in my right hand and when the teacher wouldn't look, I would put it back in my left,

289
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:29.620
I just kept doing that because it didn't feel right for me to be right handed, but there's something

290
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.570
wrong with his right hand and he's from the tribe

291
00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:45.340
of those that are known to be the strength of God because of their right hand. But does that stop

292
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:52.880
you from going into Moab? No. He takes the double edged sword and he straps it to his right thigh so

293
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:58.270
that he can reach it with his left hand and a who'd never sees it coming because his right hand

294
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:08.040
never moves. And so he kills him with his left. Come on, come on. He never saw it coming.

295
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:21.410
The enemy didn't know what a who could do and the devil doesn't know everything that you can do to

296
00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:31.840
when God fills you with his spirit, when he puts his hand of blessing on your life and everything

297
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:37.780
that the enemy has been strategizing against you in the moment in which you need it most God gives

298
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.650
you a left handed victory

299
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:54.430
and the enemy never sees it coming and you are set free. You know, in french we use the word God and

300
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:59.270
it just doesn't just mean left, It just means someone who's also awkward.

301
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:07.480
And so every time in the scripture that they said that Ehud was a left handed man, they were also

302
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.520
saying that he was awkward

303
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:26.970
and so there was never a moment that glow on the King of Morehead felt like this left handed cripple

304
01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:34.200
could do anything in his presence. You understand what's going on here. He felt so confident that he

305
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.660
could just send everybody out of the room, but just in case he couldn't be left alone with him. Ehud

306
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:53.850
says something that just captures the king's heart and he says to him, I have a message from God and

307
01:00:53.850 --> 01:01:03.390
it's just for you. And the message was the double edged sword. I didn't lie.

308
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:15.460
He told him the truth. He brought that message. He drove that thing right home. He made sure that he

309
01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:28.630
delivered the message of the spirit and the judgment of God. In that moment, I want you to think

310
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:31.110
about how God is able

311
01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:43.390
to go beyond any awkwardness, any disability, any disadvantage. Any doubt that you may have. Ehud

312
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:53.830
was this unlikely hero, A man who was handicapped, a man who was obscure. He was an underdog. He was

313
01:01:53.830 --> 01:02:05.800
a person that no one ever thought or imagined God would choose. And that's exactly who God used to

314
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:18.480
deliver this victory to the message was the sword and the sword was also God's judgment. And so when

315
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:26.940
God sends us out into the world, he doesn't send us unprotected. He doesn't send us uncovered. He

316
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:36.350
doesn't send us without any weaponry. He not only provides the armor, but he also provides the sword

317
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:44.720
that we need for the victory that we're going to need it for, but we can't be afraid of the moment.

318
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:53.820
We can't be comfortable with the past and we can't fear the escape plan that may take us through the

319
01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:01.720
latrine, there might be more that we're gonna have to do and go through before we experience the

320
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:10.940
fullness of that victory. But if we trust God then every step of the way he's going to keep bringing

321
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:20.090
the victory and so the victory isn't won because the king dies because kings get replaced. So Ehud

322
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:27.680
has to go to his people now and he has to tell him and tell them what it is that he did and that

323
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:36.500
mobilizes all of them and it gets everyone so excited that they go out into battle because they

324
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:46.090
believe that finally God has given them not just a deliverer but deliverance. That this isn't just a

325
01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:56.150
moment of deliverance. This is going to bring generational freedom. God is interested in giving us

326
01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:07.490
generational freedom, not 18 years of slavery, but 80 years of freedom. Generational freedom that if

327
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:18.040
we stay with and stick with it, God is gonna make sure that we keep living free in revelations 1 16,

328
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:26.840
it's the last verse we're gonna read, but it talks about Jesus and it says that he held seven stars

329
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:34.360
in his right hand and then he had a sharp two edged sword that came from his mouth and his face was

330
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:43.360
like the sun in all its brilliance. And what this image is is just the power and the magnitude and

331
01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:53.760
the strength that Jesus has, it reveals that even the stars can be held in his hand. It shows that

332
01:04:53.770 --> 01:05:03.840
the sun can be his very countenance that it can dispel any darkness that the sword that we need in

333
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:12.740
every battle is Jesus. That because we have him, we always get to win that. It doesn't matter what

334
01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:19.500
the situation is, he will always be the sword that we need in every fight. He is the victory that

335
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:27.090
we've been looking for and that we have been desiring and that we have been unfortunately at times

336
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:40.210
not allowing him to give us because we have been content with living in servitude instead of living

337
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:45.630
in the freedom that he has given each and every one of us. Are you ready to receive that freedom?

338
01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:57.360
Are you ready to wield that double edged sword in your life? So we say no more and we let that sword

339
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:04.580
do the work that it needs to do in the area of our life where we need it most. And so Father, thank

340
01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:11.330
you for every person here for the way that you have brought us into this incredible place and space

341
01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:17.890
to experience your word and a deeper understanding of it so that we can apply it in our everyday and

342
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:23.310
you know where it is that we need this word in our lives and where we need it most in the victory

343
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:28.390
that we need to experience because of it. And so we ask that you would bless every person here, the

344
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:35.360
lives that they represent. I pray that you bring freedom to each of them. I pray that you give them

345
01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:43.890
generational freedom and victory. Generational blessing on them and their life. I pray father that

346
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:50.760
you would give each and every one of them the victory that you have given a hood. You took someone

347
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:58.090
who wasn't worthy, it took someone who was broken, you took someone who was obscure, you took

348
01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:05.680
someone that people overlooked and you used him to set your people free Lord. I pray that you would

349
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:13.320
use us in that same manner that we would no longer be overlooked not by ourselves and not by others

350
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:21.790
because your hand of blessing is upon us because you have chosen us because we worship you and when

351
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:30.510
we do, we hold that double edged sword in our hands and we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen Amen!

352
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:37.520
Thank you everybody thank you so much. Hey, would you just stand as we would sing. This song is

353
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:43.970
called, I'm gonna raise a hallelujah and if in case you didn't know the word hallelujah means praise

354
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:51.080
and it's a way of us praising God and and and just being able to be grateful before him. It's one of

355
01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.240
those words that come out of the Bible and it's a word that is on the lips of angels in the presence

356
01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.870
of God and it's a word that we're privileged to be able to pronounce and to speak and to sing

357
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:08.270
because we also have been brought into the presence of God, not on, not in heaven, but here on earth

358
01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:15.170
and what God is giving us is the privilege of bringing heaven on earth. And when we say things here,

359
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:23.410
when we do things here, it has an impact everywhere because God in heaven is making sure that we

360
01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:30.910
live a victorious life here, go out there and live that victorious life. And in the meantime, let's

361
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.160
sing and raise hallelujah. Let's do that together.

362
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:49.430
I'll say less. You heard Pastor Zo, can just give him a hand? That was that message was fire. I

363
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:57.520
don't know, that spoke to me man. We need every voice and every limb for this one. This is a song of

364
01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.950
victory. This is a song of deliverance, this is your freedom. It's up to you to claim it guys. So

365
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:04.570
let's we need help here. Come on!

379
01:13:51.730 --> 01:14:00.070
Sing a little louder, raise a hallelujah. God! Thank you for coming. We appreciate your presence. We

380
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:05.260
hope that message has blessed you and that you're gonna take something away from this for the week.

381
