1
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:28.630
Right. Let's do this. Hey, good morning and congratulations for being on time. It's amazing. I

2
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.929
really appreciate that. And the band does too. And we've got a great set of worship for you today

3
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.720
and a great series that we are launching into called Getting There. And we just want to welcome you

4
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:47.549
to River's Edge. Um Pastor Lorenzo and everyone, most people call me Zoe and, and I appreciate you

5
00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:54.339
guys just being here today on the day where you could be anywhere else. It's pretty smoky outside. I

6
00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:00.899
think the quality of the air is a little better in here. And as we worship together, I think that

7
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:06.940
we're going to be able to experience other measures of quality above all God's presence that is

8
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:15.230
going to welcome us, receive us the way we are, but also help us to journey on this path that each

9
00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:22.519
of us is on. I know that each of us is at a different place in our spiritual journey, but each of us

10
00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:32.080
has a unique story to tell that God is investing in us so that we can announce the good news, the

11
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:38.020
good news of what he's doing in your life, but also what he's going to do through your life. And I

12
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:46.280
pray that that happens today and every day going forward. Well, why don't you join us by standing as

13
00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:52.929
we would sing that first song and let us be welcomed with prayer into his presence today. Father, I

14
00:08:52.940 --> 00:09:00.840
thank you for the way that you receive us and how you challenge us and motivate us to be more like

15
00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:07.070
Jesus. Every day. I pray that today we would be inspired by his truth and his principles that we

16
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:15.650
would enter into this time of putting aside all that may be burdening us and, and worrying us things

17
00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:22.200
that would be weighing us down and that we would worship you freely in this space, knowing that your

18
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:31.479
promises are going to come to pass in all of our lives that you are going to move with power and you

19
00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:39.940
are going to move with love and with grace. I thank you that today we can rejoice together and I

20
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:48.140
pray these songs would lift us up and encourage us and we ask these things in jesus' name. Amen.

21
00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:49.679
Amen. Let's worship together.

22
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.070
I you with that idea of being here with joy in our hearts. I'm so glad that you're here. We're gonna

23
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.070
worship the Lord and I'm so glad that you are here in the house of the Lord. Let's sing house of the

24
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.739
Lord together.

53
00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:27.830
So glad you guys are in the house of the Lord. Let's keep going with the song heartbeat and we want

54
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:34.250
to know God's heart and we want him to know ours. So let's sing this with our heart. Praise God

68
00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:19.380
For this next song, I just want everyone to just think of it as a love letter between you and God

69
00:18:19.689 --> 00:18:25.750
just, we're gonna meditate on his love. We're gonna remind our souls about His love. And when you

70
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.359
lift your voice, you are reminding your soul, you're shifting the atmosphere in your heart. When you

71
00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:36.859
sing these words to God, I can't do it for you. Like you've got to really be the one. When you open

72
00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:40.609
your mouth, there's power of the power of Jesus comes out of your mouth when you sing this over

73
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:45.589
yourself. So let's just meditate on this. This is all about his love. His love is what changes His

74
00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:52.000
love is what heals. It's what heals and it strengthens us. It doesn't leave us where we found us, it

75
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:58.520
doesn't leave us the way we were before we broke, it leaves us stronger. So just wherever you are,

76
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.689
wherever you're at, whatever you're going through, his love will be what heals you and his love

77
00:19:02.699 --> 00:19:09.439
never fails. So that's, that's the message. That's what your heart needs to hear from your voice. So,

78
00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:12.510
let's sing this together and just think of it as a love letter.

110
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:15.060
Well, all our elementary school kids are off to the annex, which is our daycare facility during the

111
00:25:15.069 --> 00:25:22.569
week. And something to say about that is that we have an incredible day care and ministry that

112
00:25:22.579 --> 00:25:31.060
happens from Monday to Friday and who is our director for both the daycare and our kids and youth

113
00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:38.439
ministry here has been doing a phenomenal job and uh we are about to hit the threshold of 60 kids

114
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:44.479
and that's like uh something that we haven't experienced in a very, very, very, very long time. And

115
00:25:44.489 --> 00:25:52.560
uh imagine that after uh COVID that we had incredible difficulties and, and losses in that regard.

116
00:25:52.819 --> 00:26:00.390
And now for the very first time, we're, we're about to hit 60 to 65 in the next few weeks. And uh

117
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.030
looks like by September, we're still going to be somewhere around 70 Children. So can we give that

118
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.469
up to um and her team

119
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:16.920
and um I just wanna thank the teachers today as they go and teach the kids and then we're gonna be

120
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:24.859
adding a live worship uh to the kids ministry uh beginning in July. So there's gonna be a rotation

121
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:31.000
that's gonna happen of musicians from our worship team that are gonna be going over to the kids and

122
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:36.880
uh and leading them in live worship and we wanna just give it up to our worship team uh for their

123
00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:44.099
love and dedication. Um not only to this ministry but to the Lord and being able to do this for the

124
00:26:44.109 --> 00:26:50.020
kids as well. But we had a, a worship night on Friday night and I just want to put up a few pictures

125
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:55.089
of that. It was just an incredible night of worship, gathering churches and people from different

126
00:26:55.099 --> 00:27:01.160
communities. Um So the band just up here on the ground, removed the chairs and gave people an

127
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:07.810
opportunity to move forward and, and to worship. We had such a, a, an amazing turnout for our

128
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.660
national weekend and Nate actually also preached for the first time and led communion. So let's give

129
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.089
it up to Nate and uh

130
00:27:19.069 --> 00:27:25.760
as he gave a message on uh on, on just peace and rest and, and also for Brian for leading the team

131
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.479
and just for all the rehearsals that went into doing that. And it's this worship night that we do

132
00:27:30.489 --> 00:27:34.880
through our young adult ministry here at River's Edge and we do that every couple of months. The

133
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.810
next one is gonna be coming up in September. And so we'll give you information on that as it comes

134
00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:46.119
closer just in case you didn't know our youth ministry actually meets at 10 a.m. and so on Sundays

135
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:53.060
at 10 a.m. 30 minutes before the gathering. And if you want to get involved in the youth ministry,

136
00:27:53.349 --> 00:27:58.420
uh this would be a great opportunity for you to serve in youth. But at the same time, still be able

137
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:04.420
to take part in the gathering, which starts at 10 30. So if you have thought about it before, but

138
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:09.699
you kind of said, oh man, but I don't want to miss the Sunday gathering. Well, now you can do both.

139
00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:15.510
You can serve in youth and also attend um the youth gathering, uh the, the, the, the adult gathering

140
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.489
as well. And so just keep that in mind. And then we have uh a great guys and girls event that's

141
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.270
coming up in July. It's going to be a barbecue and volleyball as you know, we've launched two new

142
00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:38.369
ministries now for girls and for guys and it's happening um this coming July 15th. So make a note of

143
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:44.599
that. It's gonna be from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. And we're excited to be able to gather in the park right

144
00:28:44.609 --> 00:28:48.260
here in front of the church and we're going to set up some volleyball nets and we're gonna have a

145
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:53.380
great barbecue and a great opportunity for us to just to hang out and get to know one another. And

146
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:58.239
it's really open to everybody. So anybody you know that you wanna bring with you, it's a great way

147
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.109
for us to get to know people, connect them and also connecting to this community. So that's

148
00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:08.729
happening on July 15th. If you um want to take a flyer, there's some flyers at the info booth,

149
00:29:08.739 --> 00:29:13.660
there's some at the cafe. Um And so you can just pick one of those up and then just have that for

150
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:18.660
yourself or to give out to somebody else as well. And then over the summer as you know, like we're

151
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:24.319
gonna fluctuate in attendance and, but we can't fluctuate in our giving and I pray that you guys

152
00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:29.339
will be consistent in that in and we have four ways to give. So no matter where you are vacationing

153
00:29:29.349 --> 00:29:36.349
in the world, you can always give through our apps which are tide or even Canada helps and you can

154
00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:41.939
always send a need transfer. So even if you're not in person, there's no reason to not be able to

155
00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:46.750
contribute to the community of faith that you're a part of and that makes all of these events and

156
00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.619
ministries uh possible. And so thank you for that. So we are going to transition now into the

157
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:58.050
message and today we are going to be talking about transitions and life transitions. And so let's

158
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.660
take a look at this video and then we'll begin in just a few moments.

159
00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:59.329
So the series called Getting There is about getting to the destination that we have in our hearts.

160
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:06.670
It's about obviously navigating life's obstacles and finding ourselves hitting detours along the way.

161
00:31:06.989 --> 00:31:13.150
One of the things that I've understood through my own life experiences, but also in being a pastor

162
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.510
and a life coach and doing things like that, not just for people, but also for businesses and also

163
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.949
for athletes. I've come to understand that our brain doesn't know the difference between a physical

164
00:31:23.959 --> 00:31:30.560
wound and a soul wound. And I know that often when we see someone who's hurting, we go up to them

165
00:31:30.569 --> 00:31:35.530
and we say what's wrong and we can tell that something's not right. The first thing that we imagine

166
00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:42.280
is that they've experienced a soul wound, that there is something about what they are revealing to

167
00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:51.400
us in the moment that is not right with them. And they may not always know that they are signaling

168
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.780
that they're hurting that they're wounded, there's something wrong and, and some of the ways that we

169
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:05.329
can tell that someone is wounded in a particular area is, is how they react. Sometimes the way a

170
00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:12.010
person reacts in the situation that they're faced with is, is, is revealing a wound. It's revealing

171
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:18.650
an area where they haven't experienced the healing that God wanted to bring to them and is in

172
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:24.949
process of bringing and that they're still working on. And it doesn't mean that it's neglect on

173
00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:30.219
their part. It doesn't mean that God isn't with them it doesn't mean that they're not trying. But

174
00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:38.510
the reality is, is that this moment has revealed the wound. And sometimes when we look at a person

175
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:45.410
who's wounded, we can sometimes identify with that wound. We can think back to our own past

176
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:52.849
experiences and we can relate to what a person is going through, especially if they open up about

177
00:32:52.859 --> 00:33:00.810
that wound. We can sometimes mirror the pain that they've gone through by speaking of an own, our

178
00:33:00.819 --> 00:33:08.150
own pain and of our own wounded. And in those moments, we can sometimes find connection and find

179
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:15.270
empathy on a level that we otherwise would not achieve. Had we not have had a similar shared

180
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:22.050
experience. When we talk about shared experiences, we sometimes don't realize that the person who

181
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:30.930
has had the the greatest shared experience with us is Jesus Christ. There is no one in this world

182
00:33:30.939 --> 00:33:39.280
who understands our pain and our wounded more than him. And yet we often don't realize that we don't

183
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:46.280
just have in Jesus, a savior, we have someone who has experienced every wound this world had to

184
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:57.099
offer and knows how to journey with us in our own wounded. And so when we go to Jesus, we find not

185
00:33:57.109 --> 00:34:04.800
just someone who understands us, but someone who can relate to every aspect of our story. And more

186
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:12.809
importantly, someone who has gone through it themselves. And while I can't find that in a human

187
00:34:12.819 --> 00:34:20.570
being, I can find that in Jesus. And while I can never make a friend as close as I would like, I can

188
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.189
have a friend that is closer than a brother in Jesus.

189
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:32.958
If I cannot get the healing that I need from the resources that are available to me. And the amazing

190
00:34:32.968 --> 00:34:37.388
people that God can bring into my life and surround me with. And even the Godly counsel that I can

191
00:34:37.398 --> 00:34:44.079
receive, I can receive a measure of healing from Jesus that can come from no better source than the

192
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:51.879
source of God, who is the healer whose love is so infinite and so capable of reaching the innermost

193
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:58.820
parts of both our mind and our body where not only will he be able to heal our soul where we have

194
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:07.770
experienced woodenness, but then the after effects which are most definitely seen in the physical,

195
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:19.129
I've come to believe that there are always emotional phases that we experience when we find

196
00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:26.679
ourselves in moments of transition. One of the things that tends to come up first as a defense

197
00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:35.409
mechanism is obviously one of denial. A second one is resistance. A third is commitment. And then

198
00:35:35.419 --> 00:35:43.610
the fourth is exploration. Now, obviously, God wants us to be at a place where we're committed and

199
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:52.090
exploring and not a place where we're in denial or resistance. And so I need you to kind of look at

200
00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:57.719
yourself this morning a little bit and just say this is the area in which I'm struggling with this

201
00:35:57.729 --> 00:36:05.149
is what I believe is the phase that I'm actually in, I'm in this phase of denial, resistance,

202
00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:11.370
commitment and exploration. Now, when you do that, what it does is that it opens you up to an

203
00:36:11.379 --> 00:36:18.419
awareness that you possibly think you have, but maybe not to the level that you need it. And so when

204
00:36:18.429 --> 00:36:26.010
we talk about phases of transition, uh I'm gonna go through what they are and I, I want you to just

205
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.149
think about them and I realize that you're not gonna be able to remember them all, but one of them

206
00:36:30.409 --> 00:36:37.199
is most possibly and I will say most definitely, it'll probably speak to you more than the others.

207
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.419
And if you want to take out your phone and take some photos as we go along, we can't put them all on

208
00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:50.010
one screen because of how our live stream works. And so just it, they're gonna appear one at a time.

209
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:55.669
And so the first one I want to speak to you about in terms of a transition phase is called the

210
00:36:55.679 --> 00:37:03.050
ending phase. And I want to start there because life is about necessary endings.

211
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.229
And, and if we don't accept that, then we're always going to struggle, we're going to struggle in

212
00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:13.629
our mind, we're going to struggle in our heart, we're going to struggle in our life. And there are

213
00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:20.030
necessary endings that happen to us as much as there are necessary endings that we have to enact, we

214
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:27.000
have to put an end to things and, and then when we do this, then we're going to be able to, of

215
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:34.510
course, make that transition to the next thing in a way that brings not only greater health to us

216
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:41.800
but to those around us. The second thing is the waiting phase. And many of us feel like when we're

217
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:52.250
in a waiting phase that we are not able in that phase to take the next steps. Because, well, we're

218
00:37:52.260 --> 00:38:03.489
waiting and we don't realize that it is in the waiting, that life is still happening. Those moments

219
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:12.760
are just as precious as any other. And we somehow dilute the importance of the waiting phase

220
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:19.959
thinking that because we can't make a decision because we're in transition, that we somehow think

221
00:38:19.969 --> 00:38:26.199
that because we're waiting, that those moments are not important. What's important is only what

222
00:38:26.209 --> 00:38:34.050
happens next. And if we do that, we miss out on what God is going to do in our lives because the

223
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:49.070
waiting is just a moment in the long and wonderful timeline that God has for our life. The third one,

224
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:57.280
it's called the navigating phase. And the navigating phase requires like this, this patience and

225
00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:04.500
resilience because whether we realize it or not, sometimes, well, the route is going to be longer

226
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:11.189
than we desired. And the passage that we're going to look at in Joshua, we see that when the

227
00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:16.750
Israelites left Egypt, they never envisioned and imagined that it would take as long as it did to

228
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:23.830
enter into the promised land. And everyone thought it would be Moses who would have walked them

229
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:29.600
across the river and into that land. And it turns out that Moses dies. And now Joshua is the one who

230
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:37.520
has to take over. And so we don't know how long the navigation phase is going to take. And so here's

231
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:46.530
the thing about that is that we have to remain steadfast and focused on the God who is leading us

232
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.270
every day.

233
00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:56.870
The other phase is called the reconciliation phase. And in this reconciliation phase, this is where

234
00:39:56.879 --> 00:40:04.439
we honestly, we confront our self doubts and, and we identify uh deficits like constantly searching

235
00:40:04.449 --> 00:40:08.989
for something out there instead of searching inwardly.

236
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:18.459
And this happens to most people that I talk to. It's always about what's out there and very little

237
00:40:18.469 --> 00:40:25.840
about what's in here and here and here's how and here's how God works, bring order to your inner

238
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.830
world and God blesses your outer world.

239
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:43.250
The world is always talking about, well, the outer world, regardless of the inner world. Because if,

240
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:49.750
if you know the steps to success, who cares what kind of a person you are, what kind of character

241
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.989
you have, what kind of a father or husband or man or woman, or wife or mother you are, it doesn't

242
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.149
matter as long as you achieve your objectives and are successful. If you are successful, then who

243
00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:09.530
cares about reconciling what it means to be a whole person.

244
00:41:15.489 --> 00:41:22.510
The next phase is called the asking phase. And then when we talk about the asking phase, we're

245
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:30.870
talking about, we question and we question and we keep questioning what we truly need to create the

246
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:38.070
life that we want. And, and the reason I bring this up is because just because something is in your

247
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.530
life and you are doing a thing, It doesn't mean that that is the thing that you need to be doing or

248
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:53.239
the thing that you need to be having in your life. We need to be constantly questioning this and

249
00:41:53.250 --> 00:42:01.010
then giving God an opportunity to respond because here's what I often know. People do. They question,

250
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:07.469
they question, they question because they are in a transition but they don't listen, they don't

251
00:42:07.479 --> 00:42:10.689
listen, they don't listen, they don't listen, they don't listen

252
00:42:14.439 --> 00:42:19.449
because they're listening to their own answers.

253
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:28.290
And so when they ask the question, the answer is already, I don't want to do this, but here's the

254
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.010
thing. But what if God wants you to do it?

255
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:40.560
II I get that you want to move on. But what if He doesn't want you to move on? What if He doesn't

256
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:46.750
want you to let it go? What if the worst thing you can do is actually listen to yourself in this

257
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:52.129
moment instead of listening to God. And then there were moments in my life where man even as a

258
00:42:52.139 --> 00:42:57.370
minister, like you find yourself in, in a context where you just wanna wanna move on. You do. And,

259
00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:03.719
and there are all of reasons for that and sometimes those reasons aren't always someone else's fault.

260
00:43:03.729 --> 00:43:09.850
They're sometimes just your own. And it's just easier to keep running than to stay and be changed

261
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.110
the way that God wants you to be.

262
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.000
And so we have to keep asking,

263
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.790
here's another one, it's called the choosing phase. And in the choosing phase, we notice

264
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:31.689
opportunities to engage in something new and to strive to overcome past narratives. And, and what

265
00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:36.899
God is doing is that He's bringing things into our present. And here's the beautiful part to always

266
00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:43.590
overcome the past. Oh man, always,

267
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:52.610
you know, we always think that what God brings us into our present is always about the future. But,

268
00:43:52.620 --> 00:44:00.520
but you see, God wants you to create the future with Him. But here's the problem, the anchor that is

269
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:08.500
the past is keeping you from experiencing that. And so what He brings into your present helps you to

270
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:13.600
overcome the past so that you can experience your best future.

271
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:21.360
And so you've got to be in this choosing phase where you've got to be selecting and understanding

272
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:29.500
the opportunities that are coming your way because everything is about dealing with the past and

273
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:38.100
about creating the future. And so your choices matter all along every single one of them, even in

274
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:46.760
the moments of transition. Especially in those moments. OK, two more. You still alright with me?

275
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:51.919
And don't worry, there's scripture coming. OK? Just in case you think I've like abandoned the Lord

276
00:44:51.929 --> 00:45:01.139
here, I haven't. So here's the conflict phase. The conflict days is we resist the urge to blame.

277
00:45:04.379 --> 00:45:11.909
We move away from self protection and we allow ourselves to be overcome by truth instead.

278
00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:23.729
And I know that when we get to this phase in our life, we're, we're showing real maturity. We, we're,

279
00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:28.739
we're showing that we are no longer the same people that we are able to rise above like we are not

280
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:37.550
going to be and remain in conflicts with people that God has given his life for as well. We are

281
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:44.969
going to understand their intrinsic value in the eyes of the Lord, even if in our own eyes, they

282
00:45:44.979 --> 00:45:52.739
don't have any. We are not going to see people and situations and circumstances, the way that human

283
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:59.300
beings do. We're going to do that the way that the Lord Jesus does. We are not going to imprison

284
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:06.679
debtors, we are going to forgive them just as we are forgiven of debts that are even greater.

285
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:20.000
You see, when we get to this place, we, we, we're revealing that we are not trapped in the prisons

286
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:26.409
of our own making. See sometimes the transitions of our life just feel like it's always someone else

287
00:46:26.419 --> 00:46:30.879
imprisoning us. But what God reveals is that sometimes these prisons are the ones that we've made

288
00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:39.790
for ourselves. Even if it's someone else's fault, primarily God says, why would you want to stay in

289
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:45.189
that prison when I've come to set you free? So when Jesus says I've come to set the captives free,

290
00:46:45.199 --> 00:46:53.699
he's talking about me, you know, he was talking about you and whatever prison that is. And so we've

291
00:46:53.709 --> 00:46:58.189
got to be able to get out of that face and some of us, we stay way too long in that face, wouldn't

292
00:46:58.199 --> 00:47:04.679
you agree? Like way too long? Like we hold on to things and I'm not saying we don't have a reason,

293
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:13.239
but sometimes it's just better to let go of the reason because the better reason is that you have a

294
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.449
life to live,

295
00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:24.239
you've got a future to embrace, you got things to do. You've got a person you still need to become

296
00:47:24.899 --> 00:47:30.959
and great things that God wants to use you for. You can't be stuck in that prison. You've got to

297
00:47:30.969 --> 00:47:38.879
live the life that God has gifted you with. Here's the last one. It's called the learning phase. And

298
00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:45.320
what this is is that when we've worked through a bunch of things, we're, we're now open to our mind

299
00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:51.260
and our heart and to the things that God brings our way and we're able to just embrace those things.

300
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:57.419
We, we bring discovery and, and fresh ideas and, and we're always moving from a place of

301
00:47:57.429 --> 00:48:03.370
transformation to a place of transformation. It's like there's always something continuously

302
00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:07.879
happening and it's, and it's going like from, from, from, from good

303
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:18.639
to great, from a place that's great to whatever our definition and our understanding of what perfect

304
00:48:18.649 --> 00:48:23.879
is. And God says, you're gonna get to this place in your own life where you're gonna see that my

305
00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:25.790
will for your life is always good.

306
00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:37.169
It's always pleasing, it's gonna be great and it's gonna be perfect for you. Can you accept that for

307
00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:44.510
yourself today? Can you embrace that and see your part in that so that you can experience that so

308
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:51.570
that you can live this out. You see when we are in this learning phase, we, we don't have time to

309
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:58.830
keep revisiting the past because there's something new that is always before us that we need to

310
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:07.639
embrace for the journey ahead. And so once we've learned the things of the past, then we can no

311
00:49:07.649 --> 00:49:16.790
longer be anchored by them and move forward on the journey that God is leading us on because he's

312
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.159
all about making sure that we get there.

313
00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:24.370
And so in Joshua chapter one,

314
00:49:27.169 --> 00:49:33.139
we are going to see some key principles in this passage now and I'm gonna break it down for us so

315
00:49:33.149 --> 00:49:40.689
that we can embrace these principles so that we can navigate life's transitions and let's read the

316
00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:46.949
scriptures together, OK? And so after the death of Moses, the Lord's servant, the Lord spoke to

317
00:49:46.959 --> 00:49:48.100
Joshua son of Nun

318
00:49:50.179 --> 00:49:57.659
who was Moses' assistant. And he said, Moses, my servant is dead. And therefore the time has come

319
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:06.540
for you to lead these people, the Israelites across the Jordan river and the land that I am giving

320
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:14.810
them. And I promise you that what I promised Moses that wherever you're going to set foot, you will

321
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:22.429
be on land that I have given you from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in

322
00:50:22.439 --> 00:50:29.179
the north, from the Euphrates river in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including all

323
00:50:29.189 --> 00:50:35.510
the land of the Hittites. And then no one will be able to stand against you. As long as you live for,

324
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:44.020
I will be with you as I was with Moses, I will not fail you or abandon you. But I want you to be

325
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:50.860
strong and courageous for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land that I

326
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:59.949
swore to their ancestors. I would give them be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all

327
00:50:59.959 --> 00:51:05.489
the instructions that Moses gave you do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the

328
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:12.780
left and then you will be successful in everything that you do. I want you to study this book of

329
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:21.159
instruction continually. I want you to meditate on it, day and night so that you will be sure to

330
00:51:21.169 --> 00:51:29.760
obey everything written in it only then will you prosper and succeed in all that you do. This is my

331
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:38.330
command. Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or discouraged for the Lord, your God is with

332
00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:48.040
you wherever you go challenge me, do you understand that the promises that are given to one

333
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:57.879
have been also given to you that when they are in the scriptures like this, the teaching that we

334
00:51:57.889 --> 00:52:06.770
have is a teaching that God wants us to not only hear but then apply.

335
00:52:08.949 --> 00:52:17.320
And so when He speaks, he says in the same way that I was with Moses, Joshua, I'm gonna be with you.

336
00:52:18.679 --> 00:52:23.610
And in the same way that you can turn to God and say God in the same way that you were with Moses

337
00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:35.159
and Joshua. I know you are with me. You see that is the beauty of being a son and daughter of our

338
00:52:35.169 --> 00:52:41.949
heavenly father that the promises that He has given them are the promises that He has given you.

339
00:52:42.699 --> 00:52:54.300
This is your inheritance, your inheritance are his promises. And so if we are to navigate death and

340
00:52:54.310 --> 00:53:05.739
life, if we are to navigate territories and lands, if we are to leave enemies and face new ones, if

341
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:06.600
we are to

342
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:23.020
leave slavery and enter into the promises of God, if we are to fight battles and have victories,

343
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:31.760
then we need to follow the principles and truths that are contained in His teachings. See, he gives

344
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:39.580
Joshua an understanding of what it's gonna take for Him to be successful in everything that He does.

345
00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:47.129
And did you notice that the key to that success was the scriptures and meditating upon the word of

346
00:53:47.139 --> 00:53:53.540
God day and night. In other words, embracing all of its truths and principles and then applying them

347
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:58.850
into your life. And so that when life's situations arise and when you find yourself in the

348
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:04.340
transitions of this life, you're gonna know how to navigate them because the wisdom you're going to

349
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:11.629
utilize won't be yours. It will be God's and God's wisdom always brings blessing. See, one of the

350
00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:17.949
most amazing things about Solomon and all of his weaknesses and Brokenness that he experienced after

351
00:54:17.959 --> 00:54:24.939
his extraordinary prayer of praying for wisdom. Is that because God looks at him and says Solomon,

352
00:54:24.949 --> 00:54:30.790
you could have asked for anything, but instead of asking for fame and riches, you ask me for wisdom.

353
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.929
And so you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give you fame and riches too. See, he asked for the

354
00:54:36.939 --> 00:54:43.840
right thing and God blessed him with more than what he asked you. See, when we meditate on the right

355
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:49.449
things, we'll know what to ask for God. And then God will give us the success that we need in the

356
00:54:49.459 --> 00:54:55.000
areas that we need it. See, we don't have to ask and pray God for fame and for riches, you don't

357
00:54:55.010 --> 00:55:01.580
need to do that. We're not those people. God is saying, you don't do that. What you do is you ask me

358
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:07.110
for wisdom. What you do is you ask me for your an understanding into my scriptures and that's what's

359
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:16.040
going to bring you your success. See, we have a reverse economy as followers of Jesus. Everyone is

360
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:22.229
chasing after fame and riches, but we are chasing after his wisdom.

361
00:55:24.449 --> 00:55:31.840
And when we ask God for His wisdom, we then experience everything that will be added because we have

362
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.620
put him in his kingdom first.

363
00:55:38.679 --> 00:55:44.469
I love that God just gives it to us so clearly in this passage. And the first thing I wanna do is

364
00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:50.969
just highlight it so that we can just understand how we're gonna navigate this together.

365
00:55:53.919 --> 00:56:02.479
He says, the land you walk on. And, and so when I'm, when I'm in a position of transition, when I

366
00:56:02.489 --> 00:56:09.600
don't know sometimes where, where I'm, I'm, I'm coming from, maybe even where I'm going. The first

367
00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:16.449
thing I've got to remember is that the land that I am walking on is a land that God has already

368
00:56:16.459 --> 00:56:24.310
given me. I mean, that is the foundation to everything I, I gotta, I gotta trust God for this

369
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:31.860
promise. And so III, I may feel completely out of my death. And then that's exactly how Solomon felt.

370
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:37.030
In fact, he says, I don't know how to be a king because every day I wake up and I don't know what to

371
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:45.189
do. And so that's why I need your wisdom. And, and so the first thing that God shows him is that the

372
00:56:45.199 --> 00:56:54.040
land that he's walking on is the same land that he gave his father David in the same way that he

373
00:56:54.050 --> 00:57:00.790
gave it to David. He's given it to Solomon that the same anointing that was on David is now on

374
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:08.169
Solomon. The same anointing that was on Moses is now on Joshua in the same way that Moses parts the

375
00:57:08.179 --> 00:57:17.070
Red Sea. It will be Joshua who parts the Jordan river. You see, it doesn't matter what your name is,

376
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:23.739
what matters is that you believe that the land you walk on God has already given you.

377
00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:38.100
Are you walking around believing that the land you walk on has been given to you by God. You see any

378
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:47.949
time I am in enemy territory, any time I feel like I am viciously surrounded for defeat. Any time I

379
00:57:47.959 --> 00:57:59.570
see myself outnumbered, outsmarted out resourced. Anytime I feel like I am less, I remind myself, I

380
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.959
walk on a land that you have already given me.

381
00:58:05.199 --> 00:58:09.929
There is nothing that stands before me that you have not already defeated.

382
00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.729
There is nothing beneath me that you haven't already given me.

383
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:29.010
And so this is not about my capacity, this is not about me, this is about me believing in what God

384
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.159
has already promised.

385
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:42.100
And so he says, I promise you what I promised Moses that wherever you set foot, you will be on land

386
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:49.080
that I have given you. You believe that? Wow you guys are, I'm sure you're believing it, but you're

387
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:57.570
just not very expressive right now, but I'm sure it's all inside. I'm sure it's all there. It's OK.

388
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:09.429
I know it's too hot to clap. I get it. So here's the second thing, the people you face and look at

389
00:59:09.439 --> 00:59:17.120
what it says here in verse five, the people that you face, no one will be able to stand against you

390
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.780
as long as you live

391
00:59:21.179 --> 00:59:28.389
for, I will be with you as I was with Moses, I will not fail and I will not abandon you. Who

392
00:59:28.399 --> 00:59:35.429
believes this for themselves. Come on, you, believe this for yourself. Do you believe this

393
00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:41.739
transition in your life in this moment of your life as you're navigating the obstacles of this life?

394
00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:54.870
See God is saying, the people you face, I've got this, I've got this. You don't need to worry. I had

395
00:59:54.879 --> 01:00:02.739
it with others. I have it with you. Here's the next one, the people that you lead because what God

396
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:10.870
does is that He calls on all of us to be leaders in this world. Man. Iii, I think that a lot of

397
01:00:10.879 --> 01:00:18.060
people don't understand the calling of leadership that each of you possesses already. I think that

398
01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:26.340
we, we, we are so used to giving our leadership away and surrendering our leadership to others that

399
01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:33.489
we don't understand that if these promises are for us, then we are the leader that God has chosen in

400
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:40.520
this world. And he's called you to lead in your home and in your workplaces and in society, he's

401
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:46.340
called you to lead in ways that you never fathomed or imagined. But he's called you to lead and he's

402
01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:54.110
called you to lead others. He doesn't want you navigating this life and experiencing the goodness of

403
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.689
it and the, and the blessings of it and the prosperity and the peace and the provision of it and all

404
01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:07.860
the protection that comes with it without being able to lead others as well. You are the leader that

405
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:16.469
God has chosen and the people that you lead are people that are going to be turned into leaders too.

406
01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:25.379
See, we don't need to make more disciples. We need to make more leaders. Every disciple is a leader.

407
01:01:26.239 --> 01:01:32.310
You're a disciple for a time and for a season and then you get into leadership and then you find

408
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.750
others to turn into leaders. Can we say amen to that? That's what we got to keep doing. That's how

409
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.969
this thing is gonna grow. This is how the world is gonna change. It's not gonna change by keeping

410
01:01:43.979 --> 01:01:51.370
people disciples. And there are too many churches and pastors and leaders trying to keep people

411
01:01:51.379 --> 01:02:03.639
disciples that stun God's way. God's way is to release disciples into apostles and for them to turn

412
01:02:03.649 --> 01:02:06.550
the world upside down

413
01:02:08.739 --> 01:02:18.909
there to turn the world upside down. God wants us to go out there and just seriously turn things

414
01:02:18.919 --> 01:02:19.669
around.

415
01:02:22.229 --> 01:02:30.330
And God is saying the people that you lead. And here's the verse for that, be strong, be courageous

416
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:39.459
for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land that I swore to their

417
01:02:39.469 --> 01:02:51.840
ancestors. I would give them. You are the one. You're that person. You're the person that God is

418
01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:59.979
going to use. Here's the next one, the word of God that you keep, you see, we learned earlier that

419
01:02:59.989 --> 01:03:07.719
it is important for us to experience success. When we embrace His scriptures. I know that many of us

420
01:03:07.729 --> 01:03:17.699
have experienced success without the scriptures. And that always speaks to me about how when we

421
01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:26.850
measure success, we tend to sometimes have a false measurement to identify it.

422
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:36.820
See when, when, when God sets up a standard of success, he, he looks at us and he says, the blessing

423
01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:45.580
that you receive is a blessing that you are going to also be able to bless others with.

424
01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:55.860
And that is the truest measure of success. See if you succeed and no one else succeeds. That is not

425
01:03:55.870 --> 01:04:05.129
success and it's not God's success. You see, we don't hold on to leadership. We release it because

426
01:04:05.139 --> 01:04:13.739
the only true leader we all have is Jesus Christ. So we can make other leaders and not fear of

427
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:23.060
losing our leadership because we know all the promises that He's already given us. And one of them

428
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:34.169
is for us to lead others into leadership. And so we don't have to be afraid of any of that. And so

429
01:04:34.179 --> 01:04:41.689
the word of God keeps encouraging us and when we see someone who sometimes does better than we did

430
01:04:41.939 --> 01:04:51.149
or is blessed more than we are, you don't worry about that because that's God's plan for their life

431
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.790
and it doesn't in any way, minimize the plan

432
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:06.649
that He has for your life. And how you respond to that moment, tells God everything about what He

433
01:05:06.659 --> 01:05:08.070
gives you in the next moment.

434
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:18.250
And when we get jealous and when we get incapable of, of just celebrating other people's successes.

435
01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:24.189
God's saying, well, I can't give you more. I can't trust you with Mark because you don't know how to,

436
01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:33.750
how to do the, the thing that I did, which I, I entrusted this whole thing to 12 people and I left.

437
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:42.689
Mhm And, and those people went and turned the world upside down. I trusted them with that. We are

438
01:05:42.699 --> 01:05:53.639
here today because Jesus trusted the 12th, all of them. And yes, Judas had his part to play, but he

439
01:05:53.649 --> 01:06:00.149
trusted him too right to the end. I need you to see that, that God trusts us all. And he and he's

440
01:06:00.159 --> 01:06:09.639
calling on us to keep his word because as we keep that word, we are gonna be able to then do this.

441
01:06:09.649 --> 01:06:16.500
Be strong, be very courageous, be careful to obey all the instructions that Moses gave you. Do not

442
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:23.370
deviate from them. Turning either to the right or to the left and then you will be successful. Look

443
01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:32.870
at this in everything that you do. God is promising you success. But he's saying it happens when you

444
01:06:32.879 --> 01:06:34.699
don't deviate from his word,

445
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:41.560
you don't go to the right, you don't go to the left. You stay focused on what I've already said. You

446
01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:47.939
lay your foundation on my word every day, you meditate on that every day, you lean on that every day,

447
01:06:47.949 --> 01:06:53.540
you grow in your wisdom with that. Every day. You question everything through the scriptures and

448
01:06:53.550 --> 01:07:02.780
then you're going to have success. Don't be too hard on yourself this morning and don't be too hard

449
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:10.209
on yourself in this life because you are not meditating on his word day and night.

450
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:19.530
I understand that it, it, it's, it's a battle. I understand that it's, it's, it's, it's a challenge.

451
01:07:19.729 --> 01:07:25.270
It's easy to declare these things and it's another thing to be able to do them. II, I struggle with

452
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:35.419
it too. But I need you to understand that, that I, I don't want to make my life decisions based on

453
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:49.209
the instruction that I receive from a wise person that can lead me to success. I want my success to

454
01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:58.010
come because I have obeyed the word of God. And if I don't know what the word of God says about it,

455
01:07:58.399 --> 01:08:04.989
I'm going to meditate day on night and night on what the word of God says before. I make my decision

456
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:12.110
and, and then I'm gonna make my decision. I'm gonna say God, you know, I know this is an open door.

457
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.390
God. I know this is an opportunity. I know this is something that I can do. You give me the freedom

458
01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:25.009
to do it. But what does your word say on this? See, I can, I can lean back on his wisdom and then I

459
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:31.640
can say, well, the word of God that was given to Moses and the word of God that was given to Joshua

460
01:08:32.569 --> 01:08:37.950
and the word of God that was then later given to David. And the word of God that was given to

461
01:08:37.959 --> 01:08:45.649
Solomon, it's the same word of God that is given to me. They're not wiser than me. They're just more

462
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:53.298
dedicated to me than me to paying attention to what God has already said. And what I'm gonna do is

463
01:08:53.309 --> 01:09:00.189
I'm gonna take the word of God and I'm gonna keep that and I'm gonna make my decisions according to

464
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:08.830
that. And I know that then God will make me successful in everything that I do. See, it's gonna be

465
01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:14.859
as a result of that. So I get it if there are times and seasons in your life where you kind of take

466
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:20.609
a step back and a step away and you're not as close to the Lord as you wanna be. But it doesn't mean

467
01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:27.850
that the word of God has gone away, bring it back into your life, turn back to the Lord, devote

468
01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:34.520
yourself to the scriptures again and make the decisions that God can then help you to make with his

469
01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:40.189
wisdom, with his promises that are going to give you the success that you're looking for. Here's the

470
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:48.560
last one and it's the emotions that you control. And we talked about how we can sometimes at the

471
01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:55.290
very beginning just be emotionally all over the place in the transitions of our life. And God is

472
01:09:55.299 --> 01:10:04.089
saying, I need you to understand this. I am putting you in charge of your emotions. And so this is

473
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:11.319
what he says in verse nine, this is my command. I want you to be strong and courageous and this is

474
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:17.600
how you're gonna do it. Don't be afraid and don't be discouraged. Oh Come on, I want you to pay

475
01:10:17.609 --> 01:10:22.700
attention to what he's saying here. He's telling you don't be afraid. So every time you're afraid,

476
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:28.959
you're gonna say I am not gonna be afraid. I'm gonna be strong and I'm gonna be courageous. Every

477
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:35.100
time that you get discouraged, you're gonna say I am not gonna get discouraged. I'm gonna be strong

478
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:41.759
and courageous. Instead. You see God is saying you need to speak yourself out of the pit that you

479
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:49.620
find yourself slipping into. You need to call back on my name and on my promises and the things that

480
01:10:49.629 --> 01:10:54.500
I've already declared over your life. See, the more you're afraid, the more you're gonna become

481
01:10:54.509 --> 01:11:01.720
discouraged because God is saying I don't want you to be that person because I want you to know that

482
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:14.490
I am the Lord, your God and wherever you go, I am always the Lord, your God. I will never leave you.

483
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:22.060
I will never abandon you. I will never forsake you. And so are we ready to receive these promises in

484
01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:31.459
our life today? Are we ready to make them our own to have the control over our emotions? God is say

485
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:37.759
you control your emotions, they don't control you. This is how you have control over your emotions.

486
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:44.359
You have control over your emotions by being strong and courageous and understanding that I your

487
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:51.419
Lord, your God is with you wherever you go. Well, thank you guys. God bless you. I'm gonna stop here.

488
01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:05.100
I'm over my time and I just wanted to just um I can, it, it, it's a six week series. So I don't need

489
01:12:05.109 --> 01:12:10.799
to tell you everything tonight uh today. Um and we can learn more in the weeks to come. And I just

490
01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:18.729
appreciate that the wisdom that we've shared today is, is, is God's wisdom. He gets all the glory.

491
01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.049
He gets all the honor.

492
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:30.040
And so we're going to pray that God would help us to take His wisdom and put it into practice the

493
01:12:30.049 --> 01:12:35.009
things that we have learned today. Lord, the promises that you have made. May we be truly reminded

494
01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:42.990
of them that the way that you spoke it to your leaders. You have spoken it to these leaders right

495
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.180
here that the victory that you gave those leaders is the victory that you're giving these leaders.

496
01:12:50.879 --> 01:12:58.509
Thank you for what you've done and what you're going to do in their lives today as they navigate

497
01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:08.189
life's transitions because you have promised to get us there in Jesus name. We pray. Amen. Amen. God

498
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:14.560
bless you guys. Thank you so much. Would you stand as we would just wrap this up at the end of the

499
01:13:14.569 --> 01:13:20.890
song? Hey, we're dismissed. So as soon as the song wraps, um you guys were, we can always hang out

500
01:13:20.899 --> 01:13:27.459
at the uh cafe. Thank you to our cafe team today and all the amazing things that they have out there

501
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:35.919
for us. And so let's sing this next song. Let's worship. Let's transition from, from us to, to God

502
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:42.299
again and it's always about him and how we can just surrender everything to him right now. Do you

503
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:46.339
know exactly what it is that you're going through? What you're navigating, what you're struggling

504
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:52.160
with? I, I want you to think about how God has given you so many promises today. And one of those

505
01:13:52.169 --> 01:13:58.439
promises has spoken to you more than the others, but all of them are important, but one more than

506
01:13:58.450 --> 01:14:04.310
the others. That's the promise that God wants you to worship him with right now. And as you're

507
01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:09.709
singing these songs and as you're talking with God. You're saying God, you said these words. And

508
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:16.669
what I do is I believe in them. I trust it for my life and I'm gonna put my faith in you right now.

509
01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.959
God bless you guys. Thank you,

510
01:14:21.299 --> 01:14:21.850
amen.

511
01:14:24.299 --> 01:14:33.250
So as we sing this last song together, glory, honor and power, um just I pray that you would just

512
01:14:33.259 --> 01:14:40.100
believe in every word. And as the course says, he's seated on the throne. He is the Lord Almighty.

513
01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:44.890
He is the same today and he's the one who's still sitting there and is still gonna take us through

514
01:14:44.899 --> 01:14:52.350
every transition. We need him to take us through. And then in the bridge where it says He came and

515
01:14:52.359 --> 01:14:57.859
made a way, just pray that God would just make that way again for all of us today and always

557
01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:25.560
Praise God. You're dismissed. Enjoy the after party. Be blessed.
