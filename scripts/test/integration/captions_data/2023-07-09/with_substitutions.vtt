00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:32.309
Hi, everyone. Good morning. Hope you're having a great summer so far. And we're so glad that you

2
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.920
could be with us today, whether you're here in person or joining us online. Welcome to River's Edge.

3
00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:41.799
I'm Pastor Lorenzo. And it's a pleasure for me to be able to welcome you to the house of the Lord

4
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:46.850
and be able to worship together and experience whatever it is that God has in store for us. I

5
00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:53.640
believe he's got something uniquely crafted for each of us. And while we have something that's for

6
00:07:53.649 --> 00:08:00.720
everyone, God has a way of just speaking to us on a very personal and individual level because He

7
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:07.119
knows the need in our life and he knows how to meet that need in a way that we could never program

8
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.220
that we could never plan. And so in those moments of our programming and planning, in those moments

9
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:20.579
of our crafting what we do each and every week, I know that God is able to do far more and

10
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:30.720
exceedingly better than anything that we could have ever hoped for, imagined or even put together

11
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:38.869
for our benefit. And so the Lord is here today to meet with us. Are you excited about that? And so I

12
00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:44.239
know that God has been leading us on this incredible spiritual journey. And today is that the first

13
00:08:44.249 --> 00:08:51.879
Sunday in which our kids are not going to be joining with us because they have their own worship in

14
00:08:51.888 --> 00:08:53.278
the annex. Isn't that amazing?

15
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:03.080
And so while we're worshiping, they're worshiping. And that's because of our incredible worship team

16
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:09.849
and Thalita, our children's director and just the amazing work that has gone into improving this week

17
00:09:09.859 --> 00:09:15.969
after week. And we've got a wonderful gathering that's also been prepared for you today. We've got

18
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:21.929
incredible songs from our River's Edge worship team. I pray that we have a special message that says,

19
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.549
what keeps you wandering and it's going to be something that's going to speak to us about how we can

20
00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:34.760
sometimes have a complaining spirit that we don't even realize we have and how that can keep us

21
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:41.210
wandering for far too long instead of experiencing the great things that God has in store for us.

22
00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:48.960
And today is a day in which we're not only brought into a wonderful journey with the Lord, but a way

23
00:09:48.969 --> 00:09:54.510
for us to experience something new. And so why don't you stand with me as we open in a word of

24
00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:02.280
prayer as we experience a God of faith, love and hope. And we're going to sing this first song in

25
00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:08.440
just in just a moment. But before we do, why don't we pray, father, we give this gathering to you,

26
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:15.799
we give our lives to you. We ask that you would help us to become worshipers in spirit and in truth

27
00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:23.580
to be able to stand before you and just lose ourselves before you. But truly find ourselves while we

28
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:30.460
do it. I pray that today would be a day in which we would identify with what it means to truly trust

29
00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:36.679
you and put our faith in you in spite of the challenges and obstacles and to give you all the glory

30
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.159
even for the victories that we've experienced or for the successes that we're having or for the

31
00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:50.260
blessings we've received to know that you are the one from whom all these precious gifts flow. And

32
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:56.150
so today in a day in which you have met our needs and in a day in which we have many needs that need

33
00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:04.320
to be met, we want to surrender to you and say, Lord, honor your name, your promises, honor us as we

34
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:11.400
in turn, honor you and love you and worship you and thank you for all that you've done in Jesus name.

35
00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:16.469
We pray. Amen. Amen. Let's do that together. Let's worship. Would you welcome the River's Edge

36
00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:17.239
worship? Team

37
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:41.530
me

38
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:55.830
because you are

39
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.500
No.

40
00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:49.520
Yes.

41
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.219
What holds your,

42
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.940
what dirt your

43
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:55.729
to

44
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.289
you.

45
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:04.960
Yeah.

46
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.090
It's not always.

47
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.890
Still comes in.

48
00:15:23.169 --> 00:15:24.840
I still watch it.

49
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:27.859
Bye.

50
00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:43.270
Singing

51
00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:51.650
is wrong.

52
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:53.919
Yeah,

53
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.710
we lost our way.

54
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.340
Win.

55
00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:42.229
I

56
00:16:44.349 --> 00:16:44.400
Yeah.

57
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.090
Everything

58
00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:57.200
that everything. Prays up

59
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.909
the way that it

60
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.099
still. What? Swim you're stealing then?

61
00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:31.699
Great.

62
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.339
We're going to sing a song about how much God truly loves us.

63
00:18:48.949 --> 00:18:49.270
Hi.

64
00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:55.630
And

65
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.290
I love me.

66
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.119
Yes. And you,

67
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.199
we,

68
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.979
yeah, he is

69
00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:21.089
me.

70
00:21:55.739 --> 00:21:56.089
We

71
00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:59.010
right. What, what a sea

72
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:17.719
got me.

73
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.910
Awesome. Oh, they were so good.

74
00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:36.540
All right, so good to have you guys with us. And, um, are there any kids still in the house here? Uh

75
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.880
Looks like they've all gone. Oh, great. So I don't need to make that announcement. Basically, we're

76
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:47.640
starting with uh kids worship um every Sunday now starting this Sunday. And so it's uh it's an

77
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:52.599
incredible thing to be able to worship undistracted as adults. And just to know that the kids are

78
00:23:52.609 --> 00:23:58.449
also having their own time of worship um in the annex um which during the week is our, is our day

79
00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:03.189
care and it's such a privilege for our worship team to be able to do that. And they really take it

80
00:24:03.199 --> 00:24:09.030
as a, as an honor and a privilege and not as an extra task because um they're all about not only

81
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.949
developing worshipers among us in our congregation, but also to develop worshipers in the next

82
00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:19.910
generation. And so we're excited to see what God does there. Are you excited with me to see what the

83
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.770
Lord does?

84
00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:28.270
I just want to remind all the parents that next Sunday after the gathering. Um There's gonna be a

85
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.420
time in which you can uh at the end of the gathering, just meet in the um in the, in the annex and,

86
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:39.709
and just meet with Thalita as she just introduces herself to any of the parents that are there.

87
00:24:39.719 --> 00:24:44.089
But also to, if you haven't had a chance to meet her, but she also wants to hear from you and how

88
00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:51.920
she can help you. Um Not only to better help you specifically in the spiritual training you want to

89
00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:57.430
do at home and what you want to do during the course of a week and maybe the things that you'd like

90
00:24:57.439 --> 00:25:03.890
to see our kids program have and the things you would want to see it develop and do in the weeks and

91
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.180
months to come. And so it's going to be a great opportunity for you as a parent of both the youth

92
00:25:09.189 --> 00:25:16.030
and the kids ministries. Uh just to hang around next Sunday after the gathering and there's going to

93
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:23.349
be a meeting uh for you. We also want to talk to you about our next event, which is our barbecue and

94
00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:29.640
volleyball in the park. It's going to be right here on Saturday, July 15th. It's going to start at

95
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:34.810
11 a.m. But if you want to come a little bit earlier and help with the set up, that'd be so

96
00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:41.420
appreciated. And so if you'd also like to bring a dish for people to also share that would be

97
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:47.400
appreciated too. So if you would like to be a part of that and just come, then you can just do that

98
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:55.180
as well. There's no obligation for anything. Just bring a lawn chair, see if you can bring a blanket

99
00:25:55.189 --> 00:26:00.209
to something to be comfortable with. And we're going to provide everything that needs to be

100
00:26:00.219 --> 00:26:06.790
barbecued and all the drinks. So the only thing that you need to bring is a chair, a blanket and

101
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.349
maybe a dish that you'd like to share with everybody else. So make sure to be there. This coming

102
00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:18.300
Saturday, July 15th, it's going to start at 11 o'clock and in case it gets rained out. Well, it's

103
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:24.199
going to happen Sunday after the gathering. So if it doesn't happen on Saturday and we have good

104
00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:29.800
weather on Sunday, then we're going to do it on Sunday. And if it, if it rains both days, well, then

105
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:38.260
no one's here, been praying at all and that's gonna be proof evidence right there. Um, that we

106
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.319
didn't do what we were supposed to do. The next thing I want to talk to you about is our annual

107
00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:48.140
general meeting and that happens one time a year and this year it's, it's happening on Wednesday,

108
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:53.359
July 19th. It's going to take place on Zoom. All you need to do is head to the website. You're going

109
00:26:53.369 --> 00:26:59.300
to find the link in the event section. You pick the day, which is the Wednesday and there's going to

110
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:06.270
be a Zoom link you can just log in and then it's an annual general meeting and therefore, what we're

111
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.902
going to be doing is just reviewing last year's financial statements. There's going to be our

112
00:27:11.912 --> 00:27:18.302
auditor who's going to be online to answer any questions to present his findings. And then we're

113
00:27:18.312 --> 00:27:26.692
also going to have our budget talk for 2023. Then you're going to hear from me talking about what we

114
00:27:26.703 --> 00:27:33.255
went through in 2022 and what we're planning to accomplish in this year and in the months to come.

115
00:27:33.286 --> 00:27:38.135
And so if you're interested in any of that, well, that's where you're going to head to uh for that

116
00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:43.615
information on the website, for the link and then join us for that meeting. We have four ways for

117
00:27:43.625 --> 00:27:48.026
you to give and we really appreciate your generosity even during the summer. What's great about

118
00:27:48.036 --> 00:27:54.550
technology these days is that even if you're not in the house, you can just steal, um you know, put

119
00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:01.150
money into this house, into the ministries and the activities and the programs that we have and the

120
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.699
ones that we'd love to start, you know, just doing on a more regular basis. I think that there's

121
00:28:07.709 --> 00:28:13.910
always a next level for us as a community of faith. We're doing a lot with what we have and even

122
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:20.680
beyond that, because of all the great heads and hands and just the hearts that are making that

123
00:28:20.689 --> 00:28:28.449
possible, but we would love it if we didn't have to struggle as much. Is that ok? I know that we, we,

124
00:28:28.459 --> 00:28:35.579
we've all experienced some form of struggle, but it's been a really tough few years for us and we're

125
00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:40.810
finally starting to climb ourselves out of that and it's great to see, but we're nowhere near to

126
00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:45.339
where we need to be. And so whatever you guys can do and contribute financially would be so greatly

127
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:49.959
appreciated. So there's the Tithely app, there's Canada Helps, you can go on to the website. Um,

128
00:28:49.969 --> 00:28:55.130
and then you can also just, of course, give here in person. You can use a knee transfer and that's

129
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.849
awesome because we don't have to pay anybody any fees when you use a knee transfer. And it's like

130
00:28:59.859 --> 00:29:04.930
one of the best things that can help us because no one takes a percentage from that. And so if you'd

131
00:29:04.939 --> 00:29:10.010
like to do that, that'd be awesome as well. Well, we do have some cold drinks set up at the after

132
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:16.010
party so you guys can enjoy that at the end. And so thanks to Yolanda and Patricia who've made that

133
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:23.699
possible today and we're giving our cafe, uh, leader and team leader Richard a break. Can we give it

134
00:29:23.709 --> 00:29:26.939
up for Richard? He so deserves it.

135
00:29:29.689 --> 00:29:36.420
And, uh, we appreciate how you carried the cafe on your back, Richard for, for this entire time. And,

136
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.819
uh, and just all the hard work that you did for us. And, uh, just thank you Lord for, for Richard.

137
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.739
And uh what I want to do today, if before we get started into the message is actually pray for

138
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:53.420
Richard. Can we do that? Love to pray for our leaders and love to pray for the needs in their life?

139
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.400
And so we're going to do that right now. And so father, I want to pray for Richard. I want to pray

140
00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:02.420
for his life. I want to pray for everything about it. I want to pray for his health. I want to pray

141
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:10.339
for your blessing to be upon him. And for all of the hard work, the sacrifices, the financial just

142
00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:16.099
giftings that that he has done to make that cafe possible week after week, I just want to thank you

143
00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:21.680
Lord for the way that he has honored you for the way he has honored the people of this community. I

144
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:29.000
thank you God for how he has sacrificed himself, how he works so hard, not just in this church, but

145
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:35.449
he works in the community, serving others. Lord bless Richard. Thank you for his life. Thank you for

146
00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:40.829
the gift that he is to River's Edge. Thank you for the gift that he is to each of us. And we pray

147
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:47.589
your blessing upon him today in Jesus' name. We pray. Amen. Amen. We love you Richard.

148
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.130
Let's watch this video and we'll start.

149
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.790
That's the bad thing about a video like that. We all want to be someplace else, but I'm glad you're

150
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.400
here. And, uh, before you go on your next road trip, um, you know, let's, let's learn something

151
00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:03.640
today. Um, we are going to be talking about what keeps you wandering. And I like the idea of

152
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.270
wandering and not being lost. I think that we all like the idea of just being able to take life as

153
00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.189
it comes to have that kind of not only financial freedom, but just to have that stress free life

154
00:32:17.199 --> 00:32:23.199
that we can just, just, just do what we want, get up every day be where we want, not where we have

155
00:32:23.209 --> 00:32:31.170
to be, not where we don't want to be, not places where people are telling us to be. And I think that

156
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:38.640
that sense is always so powerful um in all of us, it doesn't matter what stage of life we're in. II

157
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:46.359
I think we discovered that really, really early in life. My earliest memories as a child are, I

158
00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:53.489
think just disobeying my parents just because of the consequences that would follow right from the

159
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.969
beginning. There's someone telling us what's a yes and what's a no. It's like the things you want to

160
00:32:58.979 --> 00:33:03.479
do, the places you want to explore, the things you want to put in your mouth. Those are things that

161
00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:08.310
are all wrong, the things you want to touch, the things you want to eat that could all kill you.

162
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:15.099
There's, there's something about that that you just always are just aggressively against. And as you

163
00:33:15.109 --> 00:33:21.459
get older, you just can't wait to have your independence. And then when you have your independence,

164
00:33:21.469 --> 00:33:28.459
you realize that it's not everything that you had hoped it would be because that independence is

165
00:33:28.469 --> 00:33:34.479
really something that is always tied to something, it's anchoring you to something for you to be

166
00:33:34.489 --> 00:33:41.650
able to keep working towards what you envision and imagine is greater independence. And at some

167
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:47.229
point in your life, you start to realize that, that everything that we're looking for that gives us

168
00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:54.920
freedom, which is external, is really something that can only be found internally. That that

169
00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:02.339
internal freedom is what releases you and frees you up to live your life in a way that you could

170
00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:09.779
never have figured out no matter how much independence you had, no matter how much freedom you were

171
00:34:09.789 --> 00:34:20.000
given, no matter how much freedom you also gained for yourself. I want to understand why it is. We

172
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:27.290
complain as much as we do. I don't know about you. But I've always been fascinated by complaints. I

173
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.590
think when someone is complaining, they're, they're expressing so much more than the actual thing

174
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.530
they're complaining about. I think I've understood that a long time ago. But now when I listen to

175
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.368
people complain, I know that what they're complaining about isn't what they're complaining about. I

176
00:34:42.378 --> 00:34:47.229
know that. Now I know that, that it's a deeper issue. There's something else that's driving that.

177
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:53.889
But the only thing that they feel that they can do something about is the very thing that they feel

178
00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:56.719
that maybe they could do without.

179
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.679
And sometimes the very thing that we want to do without is the very thing that God wants us to keep

180
00:35:03.689 --> 00:35:10.179
doing. And that's the challenge that all of us have. And when we complain, we feel that there is a

181
00:35:10.189 --> 00:35:18.360
significant gap between our expectations and our reality. I always tell people when they're in a

182
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:26.929
relationship, just be aware of what your expectations are because you tend to date your expectations,

183
00:35:26.939 --> 00:35:27.790
not the person

184
00:35:30.909 --> 00:35:36.939
and, and often when I see people and, and I, I'm preparing them for marriage, I say, how is it in

185
00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:42.750
terms of your expectations? What are you expecting out of your marriage? Because when you walk down

186
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:50.540
that aisle, here's what I know you're walking down with expectations. And if that person doesn't

187
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:58.679
meet those expectations, here's what's going to happen, your marriage is not going to last. And it's

188
00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:04.080
the same thing with God. You see our relationship with God is very much like a bright and groom

189
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:13.310
relationship and, and, and God calls us his bright. And he says that when we enter into a

190
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.629
relationship with God, that we all have come to Him expecting, we have expectations about what that

191
00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:26.219
relationship is going to be like. And, and when God doesn't meet those expectations, it's the gap

192
00:36:26.469 --> 00:36:37.989
between our expectations and the reality becomes the land in between, which becomes the place where

193
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.840
we complain.

194
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.330
And what people have understood is that we don't expect things to change and because things don't

195
00:36:49.340 --> 00:37:00.139
change, we complain and we keep complaining because things aren't changing. But the one that God is

196
00:37:00.149 --> 00:37:13.050
wanting to change all along is us. It's me, it's you and, and he's using that time of transition to

197
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:20.639
bring about that change. And if you don't understand that in times of transition, God is bringing

198
00:37:20.649 --> 00:37:29.659
about change, then you will fall into the trap of complaint. And every day you're going to keep

199
00:37:29.669 --> 00:37:35.600
complaining that every day, your reality is never going to match your expectations that every day

200
00:37:35.649 --> 00:37:44.679
your relationship with God is going to suffer because of the fact that you are just not seeing the

201
00:37:44.689 --> 00:37:55.979
Lord show up in your life the way that you need him to. But what we have to move towards, if we're

202
00:37:55.989 --> 00:38:07.760
going to see change in this area of complaining is that God does his deepest work in our lives in

203
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:17.889
this period, the deepest work, the work that lasts the work that that changes and transforms you.

204
00:38:18.919 --> 00:38:25.330
The work that happens. That is most essential is in the transitions of our life.

205
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:34.340
You had a loved one with you, that person has died. You were in a transition in this moment of your

206
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:42.459
life. You can easily complain and be bitter and, and just be hurt by the tragedy of the loss. But

207
00:38:42.469 --> 00:38:47.729
what God is saying is that, do you understand that even though this has come to an end in the way

208
00:38:48.149 --> 00:38:56.770
that you envisioned it, that I can still do something powerfully new from this moment on that, in

209
00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:04.449
this transition, I can accomplish my greatest transformation in your life. And, and then there are

210
00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:09.879
many things that come to an end. And there's this idea that when things come to an end, that the

211
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:16.810
only thing that we can do is just grief. But, but in those moments, what God teaches us is that it's

212
00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:21.330
not just a moment for grief, it's an opportunity for greatness.

213
00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:32.239
God is able to take every moment of grief in our life and turn it into something great. That's who

214
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:40.239
He is. That's what he does. That's how he brings about transformation. And so ask yourself this

215
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:52.510
question, you know, is complaint, a frequent visitor in my mind is complaint, a frequent visitor in

216
00:39:52.520 --> 00:40:01.379
my life to the point where no matter what happens, I will find myself exercising my freedom of

217
00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:02.350
complaint.

218
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.469
And if the answer is yes, then you know that there's work that needs to be done.

219
00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:20.280
If your go to thing is complaining about it, then you know that complaint isn't just a frequent

220
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.040
visitor.

221
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.439
Complaint has moved in.

222
00:40:30.629 --> 00:40:34.189
And what God is saying, hey, um there's a problem,

223
00:40:36.209 --> 00:40:43.129
the problem is that this frequent visitor now is just taking up residence in your life. It's not

224
00:40:43.139 --> 00:40:49.280
moving out anymore. It's not that every once in a while your mind would have something to complain

225
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.649
about and there'd be something to complain about that. There'd be something that you'd be

226
00:40:53.659 --> 00:41:00.139
disappointed by and there be an expectation that you had that wasn't bad and that didn't match up to

227
00:41:00.149 --> 00:41:05.429
the reality of what you had envisioned for yourself. But, but, but all of a sudden now complaint has

228
00:41:05.439 --> 00:41:11.540
actually just moved in it. It's just always with you. It's like the moment you go to bed and the

229
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:16.560
moment that you wake up, you just, you just always have this spirit of complaint with you all day

230
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:23.379
long and you can't even see the good things anymore. You don't even know what it sounds like or

231
00:41:23.389 --> 00:41:30.250
looks like to be grateful anymore. You don't even know how to walk around with a smile on your face.

232
00:41:33.949 --> 00:41:39.929
You don't even know what it looks like to have joy. You don't even know what it looks like to, to be

233
00:41:39.939 --> 00:41:48.719
a person of hope, not only for yourself but for those around you and, and, and so we know that this

234
00:41:48.729 --> 00:41:56.379
can happen when, when complaint is a frequent visitor, complaint eventually moves in and what God

235
00:41:56.389 --> 00:42:05.699
wants you to get to is, is to this place. He wants you to get to the place where you recognize and

236
00:42:05.709 --> 00:42:16.090
identify and you declare over yourself and over your day and over your week and over every week that

237
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:22.729
will follow that in my life. There is no room for complaint,

238
00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:27.239
there is no room for it.

239
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:36.270
And I know that it's hard. I know that it seems like an impossibility, especially when we don't see

240
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:43.300
things change. When we don't see things improve when things haven't gotten better. We, we look at

241
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:49.280
the Lord and we say, how could I possibly be this positive? How could I possibly be this person?

242
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:57.719
Well, I want you to understand that when the people of Israel were leaving Egypt, they were leaving

243
00:42:57.729 --> 00:43:06.290
a fertile land, they had everything there and they had it in abundance. And even though they were

244
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:15.989
enslaved, they still had a lush landscape that provided a variety of foods that they got to enjoy

245
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.629
each and every day. And so when they left Egypt, even though they were slaves, you can imagine that

246
00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:34.840
they were leaving some place that was fertile, but they were also going to a place that God said was

247
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:43.719
going to be even more fertile. He was gonna bless it to such a degree to such a measure that he

248
00:43:43.729 --> 00:43:51.989
described it as a place that actually flowed with milk and honey that there was so much there and in

249
00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:00.600
abundance for them that even though what they left was fertile, what he was moving them towards was

250
00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:08.399
even more fertile. And it's hard for us because when we live in the land that's in between, when we

251
00:44:08.409 --> 00:44:14.149
are living in the transitions in this road of life.

252
00:44:16.169 --> 00:44:23.689
The only thing we're accustomed to doing is looking back because we can't imagine that what's in

253
00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:32.790
front of us could possibly be better. But when you understand who God is, and you understand the

254
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:41.449
scriptures and what they teach, what He promises is that what you leave behind is nothing compared

255
00:44:41.459 --> 00:44:43.110
to the glory that is in front of you.

256
00:44:45.379 --> 00:44:54.909
And so even when you're in that transition of having left the place, moving towards a new place, God

257
00:44:54.919 --> 00:45:03.699
is saying I am going to give you more in the new place than you ever had in the old place. And so

258
00:45:03.709 --> 00:45:06.080
the way you cast out complaint

259
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:20.610
is making sure that what you cast into yourself is God's vision. See, I can't cast a vision that is

260
00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:29.370
greater than God's. God's vision is greater than anything that I can ever think or imagine, no

261
00:45:29.379 --> 00:45:36.899
matter what I ask for, no matter how big and audacious, I think my ask is, it can't be bigger than

262
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:46.570
anything that God already has planned and stored for my life. And so I want to cast the vision that

263
00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:56.510
God has for my life in the moment of my transition. So when I am in the land between I cast a vision

264
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:06.610
that God has already declared, that casts out all complaint. And what God does is that He shows us

265
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:16.939
this by reminding us how we live when we are in transition. And when we are in moments of transition,

266
00:46:16.949 --> 00:46:22.780
and there are many that we can face many that we can encounter so many that can happen in the

267
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:28.500
various seasons of our life. Even when we think things are finally good, they're settled, they're,

268
00:46:28.679 --> 00:46:34.800
they're strong, they're solid. You know, all of a sudden something happens, an external circumstance

269
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:42.060
that just disrupts it all. A foolish mistake. A bad investment, a mediocre choice that has

270
00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:49.520
devastating consequences. What seemed like an insignificant opportunity turns out to be one that now

271
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:57.550
that we've missed it, we realize the magnitude of it. And then we find ourselves now in this land in

272
00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:03.820
between. We're in this transition. And we say to ourselves, how could this have happened? How could

273
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:09.709
I have allowed this? How could God not have prevented this from occurring in my life? And, and, and

274
00:47:09.719 --> 00:47:19.580
we, we just begin to complain again and, and the very thing that we thought we had cast out is

275
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:25.050
becoming a frequent visitor again and it's trying to move its way back in.

276
00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:37.590
And what God is saying is I want you to understand that this is how it starts, but how it ends can

277
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.610
be far worse if you don't manage this transition. Well,

278
00:47:44.909 --> 00:47:52.649
and so what God does is that he shares his wonderful principles with us in his scriptures. And um

279
00:47:53.169 --> 00:47:57.399
are you guys familiar with um the word?

280
00:47:59.959 --> 00:48:05.139
And so Manna is this food that God had to give the Israelites

281
00:48:07.209 --> 00:48:13.439
because they were wandering in the desert? Because having left Egypt and making their way to the

282
00:48:13.449 --> 00:48:19.469
promised land, which should have been a three year journey was taking years and they were running

283
00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:24.929
out of resources and they were running out of variety of what to eat. And so what God did is that he

284
00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:31.669
provided a sustenance for them that was like a resin that came from trees. It was like something

285
00:48:31.679 --> 00:48:36.550
that still had to be manipulated by them, But it could be turned into kind of like a flat bread and

286
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:47.379
they were able to eat that and, and, and the word mana itself, do you know what it means? What is it?

287
00:48:49.919 --> 00:48:58.270
Mhm And, and, and sometimes we don't realize, but God's provision is like mad. It's like, what is it?

288
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:06.949
Mhm In the land between no matter what God provides, it's just like what is this

289
00:49:09.919 --> 00:49:15.310
and no matter what He's giving us and feeding us and keeping us alive with and, and giving us in the

290
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:23.330
most difficult moments of our life, our, our answer is still, what is this? You, you see, even when

291
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:30.560
God is answering prayer, we're saying, what is it? Even when God is coming through for us? We're

292
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:38.439
saying, well, what is it? Even when God is helping us sustaining us, protecting us, providing for us.

293
00:49:38.449 --> 00:49:46.570
We're saying, what is it? You see the manner is the complaint. It, it, it was supposed to be the

294
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.129
provision, but it became the complaint

295
00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:58.879
and in our minds when God is providing and this is the thing God is always providing in the

296
00:49:58.889 --> 00:50:04.899
transitions of our life, a man. But what we're seeing

297
00:50:07.949 --> 00:50:11.560
is what is it? We're just complaining.

298
00:50:13.699 --> 00:50:16.590
And then we wonder why are we wandering?

299
00:50:18.699 --> 00:50:23.030
Could it be because we haven't stopped complaining?

300
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:42.729
Could it be that what God had planned as a three day journey has now turned into years?

301
00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.870
Yes. And while our problem continues to be with God,

302
00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.689
the problem actually continues to be within us.

303
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:10.520
I know that's hard. It's heavy, believe me, it was heavy for me too when I was writing this stuff, I

304
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:10.899
think

305
00:51:13.149 --> 00:51:19.479
because in the same way that God's been speaking to me, II, I believe that he's been speaking to us

306
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:27.080
about where he wants to take us and I don't know about you, but I'm done looking back,

307
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:42.340
I, I am only interested in, in moving forward and in this land of transition that I'm in. I want

308
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:48.659
this to be as brief as possible and I don't want to contribute to its length. I don't want to be the

309
00:51:48.669 --> 00:51:55.350
reason why I have to stay here longer than I need to. And, and if it's because of the spirit of

310
00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:01.739
complaint, that has somehow become a frequent visitor and now has moved in, I command that spirit of

311
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:05.409
complaint to be cast out of all of us in Jesus name.

312
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.899
And I, and I need you to do that over your own life. The moment it comes over you, you say I rebuke

313
00:52:16.909 --> 00:52:26.590
you in Jesus' name, I resist you. In Jesus name, I run from you in Jesus name. I will not complain.

314
00:52:27.169 --> 00:52:37.399
I will instead believe in the compassion of my God, in the clarity and the power of his vision. I

315
00:52:37.409 --> 00:52:43.770
will believe in the plan that he has for me. That what is before me is greater than anything that I

316
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:53.310
have left behind. I will not be covered by a spirit of complaint. I will be covered only by the

317
00:52:53.320 --> 00:53:01.969
blood of Jesus Christ. And it will lead me forward into the promises that he has made for my life

318
00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:10.320
that he has made for your life. You see, it is so easy for us to fall into that trap. You know, in,

319
00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:16.010
in the book of Numbers in chapter 11, it's just a couple of verses, but just look at it in, in verse

320
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:26.389
4 to 6, it says the foreign rabble we were traveling with the Israelites began to crave the good

321
00:53:26.399 --> 00:53:36.709
things of Egypt. It was looking back and they were tired of the, what is it? The man know? And then

322
00:53:36.719 --> 00:53:44.729
the people of Israel, they began to complain and they said, oh for some meat, they exclaimed, they

323
00:53:44.739 --> 00:53:52.610
began to yearn the things that they used to have. We remember the fish that we ate, we used to eat

324
00:53:52.620 --> 00:54:00.149
for free. In Egypt, we had all the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks the onions and the garlic we

325
00:54:00.159 --> 00:54:12.399
wanted. But now we have lost our appetite. We never see anything but this manner you see when you

326
00:54:12.409 --> 00:54:14.590
despise the moment that you're in,

327
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:22.659
you nullify the power of God in the moment that you're living.

328
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:32.290
You see when you complain about where you are, you're essentially saying you don't trust God for

329
00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:41.510
where you need to be, for where you want to be for where you must be. And God wants to just change

330
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:49.860
that. He wants us to nullify those effects and he wants us to get out of that condition. We aren't

331
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:56.959
just complaining about our condition because what they were able to do was was point out the menu

332
00:54:56.969 --> 00:55:05.449
that was different from then versus now. And it's easy for us to do that comparison. I can at so

333
00:55:05.459 --> 00:55:09.989
many points in my life, look back and talk about how those moments were greater for different

334
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:17.000
reasons. I think you can too. But at a certain point, you have to believe that the moments that are

335
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:23.760
in front of you are just greater and you have to stop complaining about the condition because if you

336
00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:29.969
keep complaining about the condition, here's what's happening. You're actually complaining about God.

337
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:39.350
You see the, the sin isn't just complaining, the sin is complaining against God. It's, it's bigger

338
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:44.620
than that. See, every time the people complained about their condition, they were actually

339
00:55:44.629 --> 00:55:51.639
complaining about the God who led them out of Egypt, you see when I'm on a journey with God, I have

340
00:55:51.649 --> 00:55:55.739
to understand that this journey is going to have its detours, it's going to have its challenges.

341
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.959
It's going to be a lot of obstacles, this road that I'm on, it's not going to be always a straight

342
00:55:59.969 --> 00:56:05.860
line to where I came from, to where I need to be. And so I have to understand that in the process of

343
00:56:05.909 --> 00:56:14.250
God allowing this land in between leaving one place and heading towards another that in that land of

344
00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:25.760
where it is easy for me to complain. It is also an opportunity for me to command faith that God is

345
00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:33.449
with me, that he has not left me for a moment that no matter what is in front of me, we will

346
00:56:33.459 --> 00:56:43.699
overcome it. I will overtake it. I will not be overcome or overtaken by it. Because the Lord that

347
00:56:43.709 --> 00:56:50.699
I'm traveling with is greater than anything that I'm living or experiencing in this moment of

348
00:56:50.709 --> 00:57:04.649
transition. And I will let God move me out of the season out of this place. I will let him take away

349
00:57:04.659 --> 00:57:09.290
that complaint so that He can command my future again.

350
00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:17.830
And I know that God wants us to stop thinking that there was a moment in our lives when we were

351
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:27.969
better off without him because the Israelites actually said this and they believed it and, and, and

352
00:57:27.979 --> 00:57:33.169
I know that there's been moments in my spiritual journey where I I foolishly thought that my life

353
00:57:33.179 --> 00:57:39.419
was, was easier and better without God. Anybody else make that mistake. I guess you're all still

354
00:57:39.429 --> 00:57:40.439
there making it.

355
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:52.169
Yeah, it's ok. Maybe. Yeah, maybe. No. You see all of us at some point just felt our life would be

356
00:57:52.179 --> 00:57:57.530
easier. Better richer. Let me ask you something. Then why don't you have peace of mind?

357
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.600
Let me ask you something. Where's your joy?

358
00:58:05.659 --> 00:58:15.689
Where is your confidence and your courage, the face, what's in front of you? Even though you know,

359
00:58:15.699 --> 00:58:23.149
it's beyond you. You know that God's got this no matter what because he's got you and the thing that

360
00:58:23.159 --> 00:58:30.870
is coming against you. You see when you understand these things, you, you understand what it looks

361
00:58:30.879 --> 00:58:39.129
like for you to put aside the complaining and to put your confidence in God once again, I, I know

362
00:58:39.139 --> 00:58:45.090
we've made this mistake of saying things like I was better off with that what you got, but we

363
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:51.100
hopefully have come back to a place where we understand that that isn't true. You see, we realized

364
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:56.100
that that complaining was dangerous and it brought us to this place. It didn't just get me

365
00:58:56.110 --> 00:59:02.250
complaining about what was going through. It got me complaining about God and it got me to the place

366
00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:07.149
where I wasn't just complaining anymore. I was actually believing that I'd be better off without God.

367
00:59:08.919 --> 00:59:15.790
And, and that's, that's what happens when we don't allow the transitions of this life to work deeply

368
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:24.370
and powerfully the way that they need to in us. Because here's what happens when we trust God,

369
00:59:25.139 --> 00:59:36.100
trusting God evicts complaint. He cast us out, it casts out the complaint. And if, and if you're

370
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.870
looking at your life and you're saying, God, what do I need to do to stop complaining? The answer is

371
00:59:40.879 --> 00:59:47.379
always trust God. The answer is put your faith in God believe that He is greater than anything that

372
00:59:47.389 --> 00:59:54.050
you're going through. Realize that not only is it dangerous because the Bible says this in first

373
00:59:54.060 --> 01:00:02.060
Corinthians 9 24 do not, do you not know that in a race, all the runners run but only one person

374
01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:12.870
gets the prize. So here's how you run, you run in a manner that you get the prize and the way we get

375
01:00:12.879 --> 01:00:20.500
the prizes is by not complaining, the way we get out of that land in between. The way that we get

376
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:27.540
out of this place of transition is when we do that, the Bible then says, remember that God knows

377
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:36.260
what he's doing in Genesis 50 20. It says you intended to harm me. Joseph says to his brothers

378
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.699
because imagine how long his transition was. He had to live his entire life in Egypt in a place he

379
01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:53.469
didn't want to be. And then he says, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being

380
01:00:53.479 --> 01:01:01.479
done. The saving of many lives. You see, he was able to stop complaining and because he was able to

381
01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:10.459
stop complaining, you know what he did next, he started forgiving. You see, you can't forgive if

382
01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:16.510
you're still stuck in the complaining stage. And a lot of people say, how come I just can't let this

383
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:23.250
go? It's because you're still complaining about it, you can't let it go until you stop complaining.

384
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:29.989
Complaint has to be evicted. Trust has to be returned back to God. You have to stop trying to

385
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.899
control the situation and you have to start letting God control everything including you. And what

386
01:01:38.909 --> 01:01:45.050
that looks like is more freedom that you could ever try to achieve on your own by holding on to a

387
01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:51.860
lack of forgiveness, not letting things go. And Joseph finally understood it. And when he did, he

388
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:58.449
was free and God wants you to be free of complaint. He wants you to be free. He wants you to

389
01:01:58.459 --> 01:02:06.459
experience that. You know, when we put away past complaints, the scriptures also tell us that if we

390
01:02:06.469 --> 01:02:15.120
don't, it just becomes bitterness. And in first Peter chapter four verse 19, it says this is how you

391
01:02:15.129 --> 01:02:25.300
overcome bitterness. This is how you overcome complaining, offer hospitality to one another without

392
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:35.919
complaining, offer hospitality, without grumbling. See, see the the more you sometimes offer and

393
01:02:35.929 --> 01:02:44.919
someone just doesn't offer in return, that can trigger a response of complaint. So, so God says the

394
01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:53.550
answer is to keep being hospitable. I hate that answer. I don't know about you. I thought the answer

395
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.219
would be just walk away from the loser. You know, why can't that be written in the scriptures? Why

396
01:02:59.229 --> 01:03:05.000
can't you be that clear? Just so I don't have any responsibility in this. But God says no, the way

397
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:14.330
that you are free from complaining is actually by serving more, serve more, be more hospitable, give

398
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.360
more. And that frees you from complaining.

399
01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:27.649
You see God shows us what we need to do to cast out complaint. It's not enough to just say Jesus, I

400
01:03:27.659 --> 01:03:34.260
cast it out. But there's things that I've got to do to see it cast out evicted so that it could

401
01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:38.929
never take residence in my life again. Here's the last one.

402
01:03:42.169 --> 01:03:43.260
You put away

403
01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:57.439
a lack of gratitude. The Bible says in first Thessalonians chapter five verse 18, it says you keep

404
01:03:57.449 --> 01:04:07.639
on giving thanks in all things. Give thanks in all circumstances. For this is God's will for you in

405
01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:14.000
Jesus Christ. Can we say amen to that? Give thanks in all circumstances,

406
01:04:16.189 --> 01:04:22.489
in all circumstances, whatever happens, Lord, I give you praise, Lord, I give you glory, I give you

407
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:28.699
honor. I know you're still with me. I know you haven't left me. I know that this is a tough place, a

408
01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:34.379
tough season. It's a tough moment, Lord, I'm breaking under the pressure. You know, I'm weak in my

409
01:04:34.389 --> 01:04:39.919
mind. I'm worried in my words, you know, I'm weak in my actions. You know that I'm being overtaken,

410
01:04:39.929 --> 01:04:45.899
overwhelmed. But Lord in Jesus name, I praise you nonetheless. I know that when I praise you, you

411
01:04:45.909 --> 01:04:51.040
will come with power, you will come with the strength and the courage that I need. I know you will

412
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:56.139
give me the victory over this moment and everything that is coming against me. You see when we do

413
01:04:56.149 --> 01:05:02.439
those things in the moments in the transitions of our life, we don't have any room for complaining

414
01:05:02.449 --> 01:05:08.909
because our hearts are filled with praise and worship towards the Lord. You see, the more we praise,

415
01:05:08.919 --> 01:05:15.439
the more we worship, there's no room for a complaint to settle in. And so every time I start

416
01:05:15.449 --> 01:05:18.270
complaining, I say God, I want to stop that by worshiping you.

417
01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:29.629
I'm gonna stop complaining by praising you. I'm going to stop believing that this is my outcome. I

418
01:05:29.639 --> 01:05:35.580
know you've got something greater in store for me. This is just a land in between. I'm leaving one

419
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:42.729
fertile place for another God and where I'm going, it's better than anything that I ever imagined

420
01:05:42.949 --> 01:05:47.290
and that's where I'm going with you. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.

421
01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:59.840
We're gonna just take an opportunity to just let that sink in and let God just do his work in our

422
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:05.879
lives. And, and I know that as we continue in this series about talking about transitions, we've got

423
01:06:05.889 --> 01:06:10.590
some amazing weeks ahead of us, some incredible moments that God is going to speak to us about how

424
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:17.879
we can just get out of the place where we're in and, and get to the place where he needs us to be.

425
01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:25.699
And so this is an opportunity for us to just thank the Lord and to worship him and to ask God to

426
01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:31.270
take his word and just make it alive, make it real, help us to put it into practice. You ready to do

427
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.659
that right now. It's a father. We just turn our attention to you and at the end of what we've heard

428
01:06:37.669 --> 01:06:41.439
and the promises that you've given and the word that you've spoken. I pray Lord that we, we just

429
01:06:41.449 --> 01:06:48.550
receive it, believe in it and trust you for it. In Jesus name. We pray. Amen. Amen. Would you stand

430
01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.389
with me as he would sing one more song? And then after this song we're dismissed, I'm not going to

431
01:06:53.399 --> 01:06:58.979
come back out. We're just gonna be uh over with the gathering, but our relationship with God is

432
01:06:58.989 --> 01:07:03.840
going to continue and we've got some cold drinks at the after party. They're going to turn the fans

433
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:08.870
back up because they're squeaky, they're noisy. And when I'm speaking, it's a distraction. So that's

434
01:07:08.879 --> 01:07:14.439
why they turned them down. So you're going to feel some fresh breeze coming your way right now, but

435
01:07:14.449 --> 01:07:21.439
it's gonna be cooler outside anyways probably. But just think about this being an opportunity where

436
01:07:21.449 --> 01:07:28.770
you have gained in stature in terms of your spiritual well being and you probably have lost a few

437
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:36.280
pounds too. So it's all good. Nothing but goodness, nothing but good things happening here. Father

438
01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:42.479
bless every person. I pray, bless us in these moments that we're in and the moments that you're

439
01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:51.270
taking us to give us victory, we cast out the spirit of complaint and we take upon ourselves, your

440
01:07:51.280 --> 01:08:00.350
spirit of gratitude. Instead, thank you for the way that you cover us and carry us for the way that

441
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:10.149
you challenge us in this moment. To be more, to do more, but also to trust you more. And as we sing

442
01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:17.379
this song, Lord, may I truly be a healing bomb for our souls for our minds? If we need breakthroughs

443
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:22.609
in our minds, Lord give them to us. Now, if we need breakthroughs over addictions, give them to us.

444
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:28.100
Now if we need breakthroughs, oh God, because of a lack of forgiveness, whether it's forgiving

445
01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:34.108
ourselves or other people give it to us. Now, whether it's a moment in which Lord, we need to

446
01:08:34.119 --> 01:08:41.298
receive you as Lord and Savior. Lord, would we invite you into our hearts right now? Whether it's a

447
01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:47.208
moment, Lord, that has come and gone so many times. May this be the moment that we seize and say,

448
01:08:47.258 --> 01:08:54.899
Lord just don't leave me in this place of transition but bring me to a place of transformation in

449
01:08:54.910 --> 01:09:01.490
Jesus' name we pray, amen, amen. God bless you guys.

450
01:09:04.259 --> 01:09:10.379
like the words of this song. Um This is how I thank the Lord. I don't think there's a more

451
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:15.858
appropriate song to say thank you Lord for the transitions and thank your father for all the

452
01:09:15.869 --> 01:09:26.459
opportunities that he's giving us to go from, from place to place and to transition with him in

453
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:27.149
Jesus' name,

454
01:09:51.799 --> 01:09:52.529
love us.

455
01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:59.450
Never have enough lifetime to fully know

456
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.680
to not food is a

457
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:07.930
I just search

458
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:11.160
don't play

459
01:10:14.569 --> 01:10:15.319
no red

460
01:10:17.439 --> 01:10:19.330
because you assume the best of

461
01:10:24.209 --> 01:10:29.200
for saving me when I was we. Yeah.

462
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.410
All the

463
01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.950
everything I have

464
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:45.479
my turn

465
01:10:48.129 --> 01:10:49.540
measure in the pray

466
01:10:54.850 --> 01:11:00.250

467
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:15.870
oh my God.

468
01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:24.669
Yeah.

469
01:11:26.899 --> 01:11:26.910
A

470
01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:36.529
is

471
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.529
