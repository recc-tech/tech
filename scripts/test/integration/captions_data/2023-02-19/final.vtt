WEBVTT

1
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.680
Hey, good morning, how are you this morning?

2
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:17.030
Kind of, yeah, a little bit sleepy, I understand you, I was like this three hours ago, but we're

3
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:24.290
really blessed to have you this morning with us here. If you're physically here and you brave the

4
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:31.570
cold temperature, it wasn't that cold, it was pretty mild today, but for those who are at home, we

5
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:39.690
are welcoming you also, even if you're still in your um I don't have the right translation for that.

6
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:46.740
So today we're still continuing our series becoming the one, it's the second to last in that series.

7
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.890
So it's been a huge blessing, really practical advice that we have been able to learn through that

8
00:07:52.890 --> 00:08:01.170
series. So uh this morning we'll continue in that series also, we want you to know that you are

9
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:09.150
really welcome here, no matter where you are in your spiritual journey, we want you to really feel

10
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:17.250
welcome the way you are and to give you just an example of how real this is for us. I just wanted

11
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:23.970
you to share a little story about someone I met a few weeks ago, uh a wonderful woman, really

12
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:31.300
interesting, she's coming here regularly and she describing herself as an Atheist. So that's awesome

13
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:37.350
having regular comer here belonging to that community, Being atheist and feeling welcome,

14
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:45.190
appreciated. And even if we're talking about God here and talking about Jesus, no matter what you're

15
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.575
believing, no matter where you are in your journey, you you can believe that community and feeling

16
00:08:50.575 --> 00:08:57.605
welcome and the warmth and the expectation about no matter where you are in your belief, that's

17
00:08:57.615 --> 00:09:02.515
exactly the community that we want to build. And I don't think I think we can brag about that,

18
00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:09.785
having people feeling welcome at this point, no matter where we are in your belief. So that's really

19
00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:18.090
what River's Edge is about. So feel warmly welcomed this morning. So right now we're gonna sing a

20
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:24.570
few songs and the idea of those songs and sometimes we may we may also lose that of sight, sight,

21
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:31.900
lose sight, lose sight of this, whatever the just put that in the right order in your brain, that's

22
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.230
gonna make sense. And I'll be totally in agreement with that. But the idea of those songs is really

23
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:44.320
to getting ourselves prepared. And right now, if you're just gonna take a pause, listening to what is

24
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:53.270
happening in between our two ears, there's probably a continuous flow of ideas and a lot of stuff

25
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.810
that is happening through our lives that we're bringing here in that moment. And the idea of those

26
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:09.310
songs are really to concentrate ourselves and be able to just worship our God. And also for those

27
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:15.380
of you are maybe not in that point in your life, which is absolutely okay, as we have just mentioned.

28
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:22.240
But it's just an idea also in creating a focus on the moment that we're living right now. So that's

29
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.690
the idea of those songs. So can you stand up with me and last time I've asked you some exercise,

30
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.990
like standing on one ft like this just to make sure that you're a little bit more warm for those

31
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.230
song period. But then I was sitting there and I was blaming you because you haven't done that when

32
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.930
I'm asking. And then when I was sitting there I said, oh, they can't do that because there's the

33
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:53.290
seat behind them. So I really wanted to apologize because I so judges you. Okay. I really think you

34
00:10:53.290 --> 00:11:00.040
were like just so nothing shape. So right now, I really wanted to apologize for that. So, can you

35
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.150
welcome warmly our worship team this morning?

36
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.890
We're gonna sing "Yes He Can" to start off the service. Get up on your feet and let's sing this

37
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.410
together. This is a fun one.

95
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.170
Thank you Lord Jesus. All the praises are for you, Hallelujah.

96
00:25:52.630 --> 00:26:00.580
Wow! Wonderful! So kids and youth you are dismissed to your classes. So uh right here in the corner

97
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:08.780
to my left, that's where you are welcome to go. Your teacher are waiting for you. Wonderful program

98
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:16.860
being prepared. So um some announcement and I've heard many comments about the announcement time and

99
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:22.090
it's really important for me to share that as an introduction. People are saying to me all the time,

100
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:28.670
johan we like so much the announcement. We're coming to the church only for that segment. Uh so no

101
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:34.930
worship, no message. Just the announcement. So for those of you like so much the announcement. We

102
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:41.170
integrated a new segment of announcement at the end of the service just to keep you captive. Okay.

103
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:49.720
Uh to hear more announcement. Yeah, obviously it's absolutely not the truth. Um and for those of you

104
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:57.450
who are new to that community. I'm in a special program for integration of native francophone to try

105
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:04.710
to speak english. So we're receiving subsidies for me talking here. So if you want to encourage also

106
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:11.520
please give freely that's also another option. This was also false. Okay, so having said that coming

107
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.500
to the true announcement, movie night. Okay, Movie night, March 3rd at seven p.m. Here. There will

108
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:28.720
be a wonderful movie. Uh, Redeeming Love. Redeeming Love is a movie adaptation of the book,

109
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:37.510
Redeeming Love by francine Rivers, which is an adaptation of the story in the old testament of Jose

110
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:46.690
and our wife gummer. So that will be a wonderful link between our series becoming the one and really

111
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:53.620
a good application of that in that new that movie. So don't miss that March 3rd movie night. Come

112
00:27:53.620 --> 00:28:01.580
here with your blanket and pillow, snack snacks will be provided talking about other events. Worship

113
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:09.010
night Saturday March 11th at seven p.m. Here at River's Edge. What is that? Worship night? It's

114
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:17.850
really a worship night that is organized with other different churches. So this is including singers.

115
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:25.640
Worship leader and musicians from other Christian community here within Montreal's that are all

116
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:33.870
coming together for a wonderful evening of worship. So please mark this to your calendar. Worship

117
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:42.450
night. We're talking about also a need for a volunteer with the kids. We do have some volunteers but

118
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:48.470
we need more and let me just pause a minute for that. And that's really important in terms of

119
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:54.970
announcement. So volunteering with the kids is really a good way if you're thinking about having

120
00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:03.720
kids eventually, okay, you want to have kids. This is really difficult when you have a kids too, um,

121
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:10.400
correct that if you're not satisfied okay with kids. So when you're trying, when you're having kids,

122
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:18.220
it's really difficult to come back. So that's a really nice way to try if you enjoy having kids for,

123
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:25.060
let's say just to our segment. So think about that as a training and and as a good way to validate

124
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:31.920
your intent without that much consequences. Okay, so, so, and obviously it's totally free. We could

125
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:38.450
charge thousands of dollars for you volunteering with kids and ex experimenting. If you're really

126
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:44.140
able to have kids, but here you can do that freely, wow, that's amazing. You can applause Yeah, for

127
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:54.580
sure. Yeah. Okay. But that was a twist that I was, I wanted to, to to try with you this morning. So

128
00:29:54.580 --> 00:30:00.840
maybe that's not the best twist to have. But seriously about the kids, uh, you are trained, you have

129
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:08.890
a wonderful package that is prepared by Talita. Everything is really, we're taking you. Okay, so

130
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:16.660
you're not left with that. The classroom of 567, 10 kids were really accompany you with any single

131
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:22.440
step. So please consider just look at the back right now don't look at me, Thalita will raise her

132
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:31.700
hand, Thalita is there. Okay, so don't be shy. Talk to her. Let's try it for a week or two and uh, and see

133
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:37.990
if you if you like that, so wonderful way to serve in that community. Talking about another way also

134
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.170
to support the community. I was talking about the subsidized that we're receiving because I'm

135
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:48.880
talking english or trying to but there is really four ways to give if you want to support that

136
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.840
community. Um you know, one of the things that you need to know Is obviously, as you will see with

137
00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:02.550
the community launched at after the gathering, we want to give to the community, but also 10% of

138
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:08.750
everything that we're receiving also is going through other communities to other ministries that are

139
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:15.390
serving in the world in different area where there is needs. So we're not just a community where

140
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:22.250
we're also investing here and for the local ministry, but we're investing also. So 10% of everything

141
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:27.800
that we're receiving to give back to other community. So it's really a circle of generosity that

142
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:34.100
we're trying to, that that we're really not trying that we are doing. So please continue to support

143
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:42.260
us and consider one of those four ways to give to support our ministry here. So without further ado,

144
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:48.320
let's welcome our Pastor Lorenzo for the continued e of our series, becoming the one,

145
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:33.080
it's such a good opportunity for us to gather around his word each and every week so that we can

146
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:40.120
learn from it, grow from it. And I believe that we can also be transformed by it. I believe that the

147
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:51.120
sacred scriptures tell us what it is that it takes to live a life that is truly alive, what it looks

148
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:57.950
like to live a life that is full and abundant. It provides principles and passageways into blessings

149
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.950
that we otherwise would not be able to experience on our own. We have a way of searching for these

150
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:09.070
things and trying to bring them into our life and hold onto them as slightly as we can, but we often

151
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:18.090
experience the emptiness of how futile that can be because so many things can go wrong. But what God

152
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.820
shows us is that even when things are going wrong, there are blessings and that there are things

153
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:32.110
that he is working not just in us, but also through us and in our circumstances, they are not the

154
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:42.790
final say on the story that your life is. And so when we think of what it looks like to be the one

155
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:49.740
to become the one that God wants us to be, we sometimes need to put aside selfish pursuits. But when

156
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:57.100
we are searching for a relationship, when we're in a relationship and not feeling fulfilled or

157
00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:07.810
satisfied, we can often find fault in that which we are pursuing what we are experiencing what we

158
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:13.850
are living. And so we've been looking at a story in the scriptures that's found in the old testament

159
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:23.340
in the book of Jose and it's a story that is not about love because Jose is not in love with Gomer,

160
00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:30.070
and Gomer is not in love with Jose, but it's a story of God bringing two people together to

161
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:36.960
illustrate what it looks like when his people are in a relationship with him, that they don't want

162
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:44.660
to be in. And interestingly enough, when we look at this particular story in some way, every person

163
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:52.780
who has ever lived is on a hunt for love, and we are also in many ways we're scared to death that we

164
00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:59.220
won't find it. And when we're in a relationship and we begin to see that Romantic love faith, or

165
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:04.980
there are things that tell us that we are possibly falling out of love, we're no longer in love,

166
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:14.820
like we had first envisioned or imagined, that we begin to look outside of that relationship and the

167
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:21.020
reality is is that the story in which we're in is a story of how we can do the exact same thing in

168
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:28.980
our relationship with God. There is this love that we have for God and maybe a desire to know more

169
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:35.710
about God. There's this exploration stage that we may be in if we're just kind of dating with this

170
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:44.150
idea of what it looks like to be a follower of God, or a follower of Jesus who points us to God, and

171
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:51.820
yet the story that we're in, it tells us something even more profound than that. It tells us, that

172
00:35:51.830 --> 00:36:00.480
the gospel story the story of God sending his son into this world to love us when we do not love him

173
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:08.650
back is the best love story that there is. And so the story is one that repeats itself because who

174
00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:15.700
places his love on people who does not deserve his love. Well, God does that. But we also can do

175
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:23.840
that. We do that in our relationships all the time until we decide not to anymore. There's something

176
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.250
that breaks in us, something that tells us that we've had enough and we don't know when that moment

177
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:35.770
is going to come. But when it comes, it's very hard to ever return back to a place where you are

178
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:41.570
willing to go back to that person, to that relationship to the same circumstance that the same

179
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:51.060
situations like you have experienced before. And so God speaks to us of how he is continuously

180
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.930
taking us back and and continuously going after us and pursuing us and blessing us and doing

181
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:04.800
everything that he can to give us everything that we need and us not recognizing at. And and that's

182
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:12.590
the story of Jose and Gomer. This is their love story in a way, but it's our story as well. And I

183
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:18.130
was going through this series and preparing for it and I found this this passage that I really

184
00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:24.010
wanted to focus in on today because today we're gonna be talking about what it looks like to settle

185
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:34.090
for true beauty. And in Jose a chapter three Verse one, this is what it says. It says that the Lord

186
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:44.210
said to me, go and show your love to your wife again. Though she is loved by another man and is an

187
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:52.170
adulteress. But I want you to love her as the Lord loves the Israelites and though they turn to

188
00:37:52.170 --> 00:38:09.920
other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes, what the heck are raising cakes doing in this story?

189
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:22.310
Why is the scriptures pointing out that God hates the way they love raising case. It doesn't it

190
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:28.210
doesn't it pique your curiosity just a little bit. Now. Think about how we just came out of this

191
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:35.470
season where we ate maybe a lot of Panettone. Oh sorry, that's me, I ate a lot of that. I do it

192
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:42.450
every year. I love it. I buy it and I put it in my cupboards and and I and I already know that I'm

193
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:50.270
gonna be eating them for the course of about 4-6 weeks. That's how much of it I buy. And when my

194
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:54.630
wife every once in a while wants to take it out for our guests and visitors, I look at her and I

195
00:38:54.630 --> 00:39:03.740
said don't touch that panettone, that's not for people, that's mine, that's mine. Now you would

196
00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.870
think that it's just you know, raisins in there. But no, there's there's there's every flavor

197
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:14.890
imaginable. And and the thing about this passage and what drives me crazy is that I don't understand

198
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:21.100
what God was trying to say here with the raisin cakes. But then I realized that, wait a second. I

199
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.280
remember reading about these raisin cakes before. There are a lot of stories in the Bible about

200
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:33.560
raisin cakes. In fact, in first Samuel chapter 30 verse 12, it talks about how pressed raisins were

201
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:42.770
administered to revive a fainting slave raisin cake brought someone back to life. That's how

202
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:49.850
miraculous it can be. And then there was another passage in which there was this this generous list

203
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:56.560
of of of food just provided by abigail for David. And the way that she she wanted to show her love

204
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:03.220
for him as he went out on a mission, was that she gave him reason cake. And then there were other

205
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:11.340
times where David after a great battle and after a great sacrifice in the temple, he made sure that

206
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:21.850
all of the people God raisin cake, it was like a delicacy. It was seen as a sign of luxury. It was a

207
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:32.980
demonstration of true honor. When you gave someone a raisin cake. But when God describes it in this

208
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:44.480
passage, he's saying that they're eating raisin cakes at another temple, at another altar to other

209
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:54.680
gods. And he looks at it and he says, this isn't an example of someone who understands true beauty,

210
00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:05.240
but this is someone who understands the luxury it provides, but doesn't notice when it's leading

211
00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:14.310
them away from me and there's something about that that speaks profoundly to our understanding of

212
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:23.140
attraction. And so before we take welsh cakes off the menu and garibaldi biscuits and panettone, or

213
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:29.340
Christmas cake, or even pulford, which is a dutch version of the same thing. And I've had them all

214
00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:36.810
by the way. We need to understand what the true meaning of this actually is. And I want you to think

215
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:41.630
back to the last couple of weeks where we've been talking about this subject and there was one

216
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:48.160
particular passage in Joseon chapter two and verses that we read where Gomer says these words, she

217
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:57.450
says she talks about my wool, she says my linen, my olive oil and my drink, and then she decks

218
00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:02.640
herself with jewelry. She does this in verse five, and then again in verse 13, and then after the

219
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:11.270
going after the lovers who she thinks she can can provide these things to her, she forgets all the

220
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:20.260
things that Jose a did give her. And so she's more concerned with the raisin cakes that she had been

221
00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:27.960
receiving elsewhere than than the raisin cake that that Jose was providing all along. And it isn't

222
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:35.710
just a metaphor for the way that God looks after and looks at his people when they reject him, but

223
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:41.920
it's also about the distractions that we're often faced with when we're trying to understand what

224
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.460
true beauty is. Now, the thing in Jose in chapter four verse 10. And then again in chapter eight

225
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:57.570
verse 14 is that God says that they build palaces and that there are false prophets use both to

226
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:04.430
prove that they have forgotten the Lord. And so God points this out and he says, when you eat these

227
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:10.260
raisin cakes, there's two things that are happening. One is that you are worshiping yourself, You're

228
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:16.680
worshiping your feelings. Have you ever gone into a card shop And and and just like, just looked at

229
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:22.260
the cards and and read what was written on the inside and you were trying to find something that

230
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:28.950
matched your feelings. And and sometimes when you find something and it doesn't match your feelings,

231
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:35.610
you kind of say, I can't say this, I can't give this card because I don't actually feel this way.

232
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.120
And I've talked to a lot of people over the years who said that their their their struggle was

233
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:52.400
actually finding a card for the person they were in a relationship with because nothing that they

234
00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:59.720
read was an indicator of how they actually felt. That sometimes what they were reading was a direct

235
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:08.300
contrast to what they were living. And they found themselves sometimes taking a card that they knew

236
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:15.370
they were lying when they gave it to the person they were in a relationship with. I'm not here to

237
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:21.210
expose anybody having done that, but I'm sure this is an experience that you may have had yourself,

238
00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.500
you've come close to that, or you felt that and you wanted to do something that was for the season,

239
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:35.520
but recognize that your love didn't match it. And I want you to know that that happens when we are

240
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:44.140
unable to truly quantify what true beauty is. And then there's something about our inability to see

241
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:53.570
beauty for what it is and what it can be other than through the lens of how we are feeling and what

242
00:44:53.580 --> 00:45:00.500
what Gomer does is that she keeps running back to her lover's back to the old temple eating raisin

243
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:09.330
cakes at another alter, living a life of luxury and pleasure, that she no longer believes that her

244
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:17.800
husband can ever provide for her. And when we get trapped into this kind of thinking, that's when we

245
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:25.200
get lost in not only being able to see true love and true beauty, but then to experience it

246
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:38.340
ourselves. And so God says, watch out for those reason case where you would much rather worship

247
00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:49.030
yourself and your feelings then worship me where you would much rather worship other gods and other

248
00:45:49.030 --> 00:46:00.840
altars than understand what it truly looks like to love me and then to love others through me. And

249
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:07.640
so, you know, loving raising cakes isn't a separate type of immoral behavior in this passage, but an

250
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:15.120
example of how we can turn to other gods and other means of fulfilling ourselves and satisfying

251
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:24.870
ourselves and and wanting to find Romance and attraction and beauty in that, which is with us. And

252
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:35.510
sometimes we feel eluding us. And when those feelings begin to change, then all of a sudden we begin

253
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:45.130
to realize that something is available someplace else. And I want you to know that that that I

254
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:52.770
honestly believe that the opportunity to go somewhere else to be with someone else to have something

255
00:46:52.770 --> 00:47:00.430
else is what we are continuously being tempted with. It is something that we are always battling

256
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:08.310
against, because instead of trying to find out what is true, we are going and chasing after that,

257
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:17.060
which we imagine is a truer version of what we are living instead. And so what God does is that he

258
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:26.860
confronts, that he helps us to see something completely different than other than that. And so this

259
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:32.620
is what he does. He says in proverbs 18 verse 22,

260
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:44.790
that he who finds a wife or a husband finds what is good and then receives favor from the Lord. And

261
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:50.800
so what God does is that he puts out this principle and he says, I want you to see that when I say

262
00:47:50.800 --> 00:48:00.900
this, I want you to know that this should be your pursuit. Your pursuit isn't beauty In an external

263
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:10.780
manner, but its beauty in an internal one that you are looking for inner beauty that is going to

264
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:20.270
bring about the favor of God. And so if you make this your focus instead of just pursuing raisin

265
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:28.290
case, then you're going to have a deeper and a more meaningful experience in your life. God is gonna

266
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:37.490
bring the favor of God on your life because it is your objective to do what God has put before you

267
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:48.750
in what is your pursuit. So what this does is that it reminds us These verses in first Corinthians

268
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:58.680
13. Now, if you ever been to a wedding, you've heard these verses and when you heard it, you always

269
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:05.860
throw you throw up a little bit in your mouth every time. And it's not just because everyone thing

270
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:12.840
has it, but because it just it got it got to the point where you just heard it so many times, you

271
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:18.280
just think it's just part of the ceremony. It's nice, you know the versus talking about love, but

272
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.660
you don't really believe in it, but but I want you to understand what God does with this particular

273
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:32.100
passage is that he says listen, man, attraction Romance, I love those things, but I want you to know

274
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:38.050
what true love is. I want you to know what true beauty is and not that the external stuff that is

275
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:44.300
going to fade and by the way, you know, it does fade and you're gonna spend the majority of your

276
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:55.060
life in a body you wish you didn't have and working really hard, working extremely hard to get it

277
00:49:55.060 --> 00:50:01.490
back to a shape that you imagine and envision yourself having instead of the one that is like

278
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:07.660
speaking very loudly and shouting at you from the mirror, you're looking at The majority of your

279
00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:14.270
life is going to be in a body that does not look like you and your teams are in your 20s. And so if

280
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:23.180
you marry someone based on attraction, the majority of their maturity and fatherhood and motherhood

281
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:27.450
and grandparents hood is going to be in another body.

282
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:39.360
And so if you want to be with someone and God is saying, I want you to focus on an inner beauty and

283
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.950
make sure they have that in abundance, because that's what's gonna keep you together. Can we say

284
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:52.480
amen to that? Because that's what's gonna matter, That's what's gonna be the most meaningful and the

285
00:50:52.480 --> 00:51:06.230
most important in your life. And so this passage is a demonstration of what true beauty is. It says,

286
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:15.900
love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy. It doesn't boast, it isn't proud, it isn't rude, it

287
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:22.390
isn't self seeking. It isn't easily angered. It keeps no account of wrongs. Love takes no pleasure

288
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:28.740
in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and

289
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:36.190
then it endures all things. Can we say amen to God's word, That's what beauty looks like. Inner

290
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:43.220
beauty is, that when you're looking for someone to love and for someone to love you back. Those are

291
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:48.210
the qualities, those are the characteristics you're looking for. That's what you're looking for in

292
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:54.330
the other person, that's what God is saying. Have you paid attention to these things? Like, don't

293
00:51:54.340 --> 00:52:01.220
derive your worth from, not from your from your dating status, but but derive instead from your

294
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.580
understanding of what true love is. And if you don't have that and you're not having that with the

295
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:11.790
person you're with and the person that you want to be with, then that tells you that that's far more

296
00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:16.950
important than just saying that you're with somebody and giving yourself to someone and wasting time

297
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:24.240
with someone and giving years of your life to someone who isn't even worth it, because they have no

298
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:31.680
indication of any of these characteristics in your day to day relationship. Why would you keep going

299
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:39.230
back and reliving the same garbage over and over again when God is saying this is what true beauty

300
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:50.700
is and I need you to become this and I need you to look for this and I want you to experience this

301
00:52:50.800 --> 00:53:00.410
together, this is what I want for you. And so God wants us to get this because he's saying that a

302
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:06.090
lot of us, we just we just don't and there's something about external beauty that God says, it's

303
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:12.540
okay, I mean in first Peter I want to show you this in first Peter chapter three verses three and

304
00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:19.700
four, it says, look, your beauty shouldn't come just from outward adornment, such as elaborate

305
00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:26.290
hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes because we get we need to feel good about

306
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:30.920
ourselves. And honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. We do feel better when we have something

307
00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:37.930
new and shining, we put that on and we do feel better when we do things that make us feel good. Like

308
00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:44.480
taking care of ourselves. Like like doing those things that just help us to pamper ourselves and and

309
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:53.630
its external, but it has an impact in us internally as well. We know that. But then Verse four says

310
00:53:53.630 --> 00:54:00.450
rather it should be that of your inner self. It should be about the unfailing beauty of a gentle and

311
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:07.860
quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. God is saying those external things, if that's

312
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:14.030
all you're focused on, then then what's on the inside is being neglected and and and that which is

313
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:19.550
being neglected is actually what makes you shy. That's actually what makes you attractive. That's

314
00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:26.260
what makes you beautiful. That that's exactly what God looks for. Not only in you, but that's what

315
00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:34.780
other people need and when they see that you could be, you know, in a wheelchair and it won't matter

316
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:43.410
because you are the personification of what it looks like to be beautiful on the inside. And you

317
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:52.000
live that every day on the outside, that even though you are not able to have all the beauty that

318
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.020
maybe someone else possesses, that will fade one day and someone was gonna have to work really hard

319
00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:07.460
to try to keep that going and fix it and stretch it and inject it and do all kinds of things to it.

320
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.810
And they're gonna look crazier than ever

321
00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:19.120
because they're obsessed with the outside, but don't understand the inner beauty that God and other

322
00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:27.660
people really want on the inside. And God is saying, are you just gonna be that? A person who's just

323
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:33.840
obsessed with the external? And then the first Corinthians chapter seven, look at what it says in

324
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:41.340
verse 3-5, it says the husband needs to fulfill his marital duty to his wife and likewise, the wife

325
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:47.440
to her husband. And this is all about that physical attraction. God is saying, don't you think I get

326
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:54.430
it? I invented sex. You think that I don't know how this works? I think, I don't know it's important.

327
00:55:54.430 --> 00:56:01.780
I know it's important. I know you want to have it, I know what's on your mind all the time. I know I

328
00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:09.550
know how you can be blessed by it and cursed by it. I know how you can become so obsessed with it,

329
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:15.250
that you become addicted to it. And I know how you can neglect it to an extent, or you just feel

330
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:22.470
that you can relive your rest of your life without it and there's Brokenness on both sides of that,

331
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:27.490
and what God says is that I understand this and so I understand that your body is not your own. I

332
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:35.880
gave you this and you could pleasure someone else with it. So for you to just pleasure yourself, it

333
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:41.630
is for you to be able to pleasure someone else with it. And that's why he goes on to say in this

334
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:48.860
passage these verses, he says the wife doesn't have authority of her own body, but yields it to her

335
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:53.840
husband in the same way that the husband does not have authority over his own body, but yields it to

336
00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:01.170
his wife says, do not deprive each other, except perhaps by mutual consent. And for a time that you

337
00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:07.720
may devote yourselves to prayer. In other words, there might be something wrong that is preventing

338
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.410
you from having a healthy sexual relationship, something wrong in your mind, something wrong in your

339
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:18.300
heart. Maybe you're too addicted to pornography and maybe you're getting all of your pleasure from a

340
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:23.870
screen instead of the person that you're with, maybe all that's happening in your life is happening

341
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:29.680
in a way that is broken instead of a true reflection of what it's supposed to be like. And so God

342
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.990
says, you keep looking at a broken mirror and you're trying to make sense of what beauty looks like

343
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.370
and it's so fragmented and so broken that you have lost sight of what it looks like for real. And so

344
00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:49.000
I'm going to bring it back into your life with a clear understanding and I'm gonna tell you that

345
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:57.890
this is how it's supposed to be. And then in the passage he says, satan is not gonna be able to

346
00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:02.810
tempt you because of your lack of self control. He's saying, you're going to become stronger, you're

347
00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:08.010
gonna get closer, you're gonna have a healthier relationship, you're gonna do this better than

348
00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:14.430
you've ever done it before, you're going to enjoy each other, you're going to be able to truly

349
00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:20.920
connect, not just on a physical level, but he's saying here very clearly on a spiritual one as well.

350
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:29.260
You're gonna have wholeness in your relationship in a way that you could not have any other way. And

351
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:35.430
so why does God tell us these things? He says, I want you to understand that the reason you're going

352
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:41.060
to devote yourselves to prayer and this is it. This is the reason because we must resist the

353
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:49.880
temptation to value the wrong kind of beauty, the wrong kind of sex, the wrong kind of fulfillment,

354
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:57.610
the wrong kind of pleasure, the wrong kind that leads us away from God and from the person that God

355
00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:05.920
has put us in a relationship with instead of the people that we sometimes pursue not only becoming,

356
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:14.440
but also wanting to have. I need us to see that God is trying to warn us so powerfully through all

357
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:25.720
of this, He's saying, I want you to get this, I want you to understand this, I need you to see what

358
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:33.530
love truly is. and so in first Corinthians 13 and in verse seven look at what it says here at the

359
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:50.210
end it says. But in marriage our love is called to always protect. Always trust. Always hope and

360
00:59:50.210 --> 01:00:03.830
always persevere. The reason God puts that at the end is that because at some point or Romance, our

361
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:16.110
attraction, our beauty is gonna fade. And so he says, that's why you need to come together and pray

362
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:25.260
because there's something that is going to reignite that and that is my presence in your life. I can

363
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:34.240
bring those things back in a way that you need and that you've always desired. And so would you take

364
01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:44.830
a moment instead of trying to find this fulfillment at another temple at another altar eating raisin

365
01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:45.430
cake,

366
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:55.580
would you consider doing that with the person you're already with? So you can stop searching for the

367
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.680
one and you can become the one instead.

368
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.830
Yeah. I'm always confused by your silence. Is it good silence?

369
01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:18.510
Or is it bad science? I can't always I can't always tell I can't always. Not always sure, but but I

370
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.760
hope it's good.

371
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:30.900
But if but if we developed and here's the truth. An attraction to true beauty, then we're gonna have

372
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.900
nothing to fear.

373
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:41.340
We're gonna have nothing to fear. And I know a lot of people in this room, you're afraid to settle.

374
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.780
You're afraid to settle with the person you're with. And I know why you're doing that because we are

375
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:54.980
taught in this world. And in this life that we have to always keep our options open. I want you to

376
01:01:54.980 --> 01:02:02.620
understand at the moment. You start thinking this way, you know you're eating raisin cake

377
01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.710
and so you have to

378
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:23.460
turn away from that and turn back to God's definitions of true beauty and true love.

379
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:31.170
And so if we are thinking this way, then you need to understand that the reality and the truth is is

380
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:38.110
that we're moving in a selfish manner. It's not that you're doing this intentionally, You're doing

381
01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:45.490
this instinctively. You're doing this because there is darkness and Brokenness in all of us because

382
01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:51.110
we don't understand true love and true beauty. We don't know what to look for in another person, but

383
01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:59.970
we do know what pleasures us. And so if the standard is what pleasures me, guess what? That's raisin

384
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:10.440
cake. But if if the standard is loving another person sacrificing for them giving ourselves up so

385
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:18.920
that they can be fulfilled. That's True beauty. That is true love. And that is what we are looking

386
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:27.710
for. That is what we are asking God for. And so interestingly enough, Paul quotes Hosea and in

387
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:35.030
Romans chapter nine and in verse 25 this is what he says, he says, I will call my people those who

388
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:46.810
aren't my people And the one who isn't well loved, I will call a loved one and what God is saying is

389
01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:55.590
that if I can do this, you can do it. If you can understand how I do this, you can do it because I

390
01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:02.090
am with you in you working through you, this is the love that I bring with me and I can bring that

391
01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:10.170
into your life and I can make sure that the favor of God is on you working through you is having an

392
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:17.420
impact in your life and so let me ask you some questions here and think about this before we, we

393
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:24.370
transition now into a time of prayer and I want you to answer honestly within your own mind and

394
01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:31.180
heart. Are you drawn more to an outer beauty than an inner beauty

395
01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:42.360
generally speaking, will you be able to serve God better together with this person or apart?

396
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:52.340
Do you desire to fulfill the biblical role of a husband and wife outlined in scripture? Are you just

397
01:04:52.340 --> 01:05:00.890
satisfied with just being yourself? Is the relationship that you're in or the one that you're

398
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:11.250
seeking? Is it going to help you in your Christian discipleship or does it dull and distract your

399
01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:15.330
interest in the Lord and in his people

400
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:26.190
when you're together? Are you more or less eager to grow spiritually

401
01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:34.800
when you're together? Do you study God's word? Do you pray? Do you give yourself in service to God

402
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:42.850
and to others as a result of the time that you are spending together? Do you think that he or she

403
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:51.490
will make a good disciple er of your Children or even your grandchildren and what do other mature

404
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:58.510
Christian friends and family members say about your relationship? Do others see a relationship that

405
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:05.370
is spiritually solid and God glorifying or do they see something that is rather superficial and is

406
01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:12.690
based on just physical attraction and and there isn't a lot of depth and meaning to it.

407
01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:20.270
I know that what God has to offer us is sometimes different than what we think we can offer

408
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:24.460
ourselves and I know that it's totally different than even maybe what we've experienced in our past

409
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:31.140
before and I know what some of us are thinking. Sometimes you you date people and you realize that

410
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.680
sometimes the person you've dated um you know who said they were a believer said they were a

411
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:42.150
follower of Christ, They turned out to be worse than than anybody you've ever dated sometimes even

412
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.710
worse than anybody you ever married

413
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:53.860
and I just want you to understand that that that's gonna happen if you are unable to set the right

414
01:06:53.860 --> 01:07:02.350
boundaries around your own heart and mind. It is a reflection of how you are not able to choose what

415
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:09.510
is good and right and acceptable and perfect for you. It is an indication of who the other person is.

416
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:18.970
It's a testament to who you are to what's missing and do what needs to change in you and through you,

417
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:24.600
you see what God does is that he says, I want to give you a healthy understanding of what true

418
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.840
beauty is. I want to give you an understanding of what real love is. I want you to go by these

419
01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:35.780
principles and when you're making your choices, you're looking at these things and you're saying,

420
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:45.860
can I live up to this? And as a person that I'm seemingly attracted to Romantically and and and and

421
01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:54.690
I find myself drawn to them sexually, is this person also able to live up to the same standard? Are

422
01:07:54.690 --> 01:08:00.380
they at least trying? Are they gonna make an effort? Is this something that they're pursuing? Is

423
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.820
this something that they want? Is this an improvement that they want to see take place or are they

424
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:14.360
just in it to test, drive me, take advantage of me use me for as long as I allow them. And then when

425
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:20.020
they fall out of love or I do the same that I will move on to someone and something else. Because

426
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:22.690
guess what? I kept my options open

427
01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:34.500
as far as I was concerned, this was never for keeps. I hoped it was. I believed it might be. And

428
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:40.990
when they read first Corinthians 13 at my wedding, I thought maybe it could be. But now I realize

429
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:47.520
that that wasn't true. And so now I'm gonna go and look for someone and something else and here's

430
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:57.620
the problem with that we never become who we need to be let alone for someone else to love and to

431
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:05.770
have a better understanding of what true love and beauty is. Let's commit ourselves to becoming

432
01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:07.250
beautiful on the inside.

433
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:17.500
Let's commit ourselves to standards that are higher than our own and not the broken standards of

434
01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:25.930
this world and of those around us. Let's live in a manner that shows us what true beauty and true

435
01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:36.030
love truly is. And then God says, I will favor you, I will bless you and I will bring that into your

436
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:43.700
life. You will have this because you have made a decision to become this

437
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:54.060
because you have decided to become this. You will experience this. You will live this because you

438
01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:02.590
were devoted to this. You will have it anybody else done with having raisin cake. Come on, we're

439
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:03.850
done with the raisin cake.

440
01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:15.760
If you arrived at the end, you have no idea what I just said and why. Raisin cake, The heck is he

441
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.560
talking about?

442
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:27.170
I love it. Thank you guys. I'm gonna stop here. Okay? And we'll continue next week. Sounds good. All

443
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:36.200
right, So I'll give you guys a chance to to just stand with me at the end and we're going to have

444
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.770
the banjos come back and they're gonna do one more song and then after they do their song, we're

445
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:47.070
gonna let you and just share some more announcements with us. But before he does that, then can we

446
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:53.550
just take a moment and just say God, I wanna, I wanna I want to be beautiful on the inside. I want

447
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:59.580
to I want to live according to your standards and your principles. I want to experience true beauty.

448
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:06.910
I want to experience true love. I want it in a way that brings favor and blessing not only into my

449
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:12.840
life but into the life of the person that I'm with, the person that I hope to have with me and to

450
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:19.230
build a life with that person, the person that that God has gifted you already, the person that you

451
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:27.770
are already in a commitment with that God can help you to to once again experience the fullness of

452
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:34.590
everything that we have talked about today. And so Lord, as we just give ourselves to you and

453
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:40.300
humility and simplicity of faith, we're all at different places in our spiritual journey and there's

454
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:45.990
certain things that we've been able to receive and others that we've we have not, there are things

455
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.630
that we're able to perceive and understand and implement and others, Lord, that we're just not ready

456
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:58.190
to wherever we are on this spectrum and where we are on this journey. I pray that you would just

457
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:03.560
deal with us with love as you always have and that you would be gracious and merciful towards us,

458
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.620
that you'd be compassionate, that you would help us to take the next steps in our, in our journey of

459
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:16.940
life and and even in our spiritual journey as well that you would look at us and that you would

460
01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:32.130
truly redeem renew refresh and fully restore that which this world and it's false beauty and love as

461
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:42.150
possibly wrecked havoc in our minds and in our hearts in our relationships. I pray Lord that we

462
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:55.280
would experience something new and that you would lead us there in a powerful and loving way.

463
01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:08.290
Lord thank you for the scriptures and what they teach us. But thank you that you are with us always,

464
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:19.140
even when we don't feel it, when we don't want it, when we sometimes don't even choose it, you were

465
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:31.460
still there and we pray these things in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Thanks guys, thank you God

466
01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.280
bless you.

467
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:42.590
Let's um let's sing this beautiful song. It's called Do it again. And what it does is that it

468
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:50.070
reminds us of things past, present and also future things that we have seen God do things that we're

469
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:58.010
hoping he will do things that we pray will happen as well. And so would you just sing this song

470
01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:07.260
together as we would reflect on this and then johan is gonna come and just lead us into a beautiful

471
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.390
brunch that we're gonna have together. So stick around for that. God bless you guys. Thank you.

504
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:29.280
Thank you for your faithfulness. Praise God.

505
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:44.350
So it was a wonderful gathering, thank you so much for being with us. Um and I strongly believe that

506
01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:51.200
God used uh his word and that moment that we had together to make sure that we keep our standards

507
01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:58.780

508
01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:06.170

509
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:13.260
extremely clear, we're taking a great care of any kids that is there. We're making sure that there

513
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:39.120
So if you have gave to that community last last year, please recuperate your receipt. Super

514
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.900
important because you take that receipt put that in your income tax receipts at the end of the day

515
01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:48.460
and you will have a wonderful credit if you have paid some income tax, you need to have paid tax

516
01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:53.320
before. Okay, important and then you can recuperate and if you don't know what to do with that money

517
01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:59.730
that you receive, consider giving to River's Edge. We're always welcoming this money. Okay, so just
