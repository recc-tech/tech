00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.250
Thank you Jesus that we can call on your name.

7
00:10:46.369 --> 00:10:53.960
Father. I just pray that you would have your way here today. Have your way in us. We pray this in

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:58.599
the name above all names. We exalt thee Jesus. Amen.

I gave him my

every breath that I

69
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:57.189
No.

70
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.030
Yeah,

71
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:13.739
great.

72
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.170
I

73
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.000
praise God. I mean to see that.

74
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:58.000
Thank you worship team for that lovely set. So let's get to the boring stuff, the announcements

75
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:05.079
and try and get Pastor Zoe out as quick as possible. All right. So we're gonna start off with the

76
00:26:05.089 --> 00:26:11.319
serve team. Uh We are still looking for people for our kids ministry and our tech team. So if that's

77
00:26:11.329 --> 00:26:17.489
something that might interest you, there are two sign up clipboards in the back of the room by the

78
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.709
info booth where uh Michelle is trying to point at it.

79
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:30.739
So if everyone looks back, you can see. All right. And if serving in one of those two teams isn't

80
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:36.839
something you're looking for. There's always four different ways you can give you, you can give

81
00:26:36.849 --> 00:26:43.010
financially if you want. You don't have to no pressure. But, uh, we, we do have 44 different ways.

82
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:50.739
So feel free if that, uh, is something more you're more likely to do. Also, please stick around

83
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:58.000
after our service. We have a lovely Thanksgiving feast prepared for us by our, our community kitchen.

84
00:26:58.329 --> 00:27:02.880
So let's give them a quick applause right now because they've been working hard all morning

85
00:27:05.609 --> 00:27:12.979
and like usual, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be the best food ever. So, and uh after that, we have our

86
00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:20.880
women's ministry. They have an event on October 21st at 3 p.m. and they're continuing their series

87
00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:28.130

98
00:28:46.979 --> 00:28:56.619
it should be a great time. And uh yeah, so that concludes for the for the announcements. And uh

99
00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:02.729
let's just welcome Pastor Lorenzo with uh a warm welcome. Thank you.

100
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:31.729
So, a turning point in my life was a season not too long ago when I felt that nothing was working

101
00:29:31.739 --> 00:29:39.079
out. I was being misinterpreted. People were leaving projects I had going on were falling through

102
00:29:39.349 --> 00:29:45.420
and I was crying out to God saying, would somebody please advocate for me, would somebody please

103
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:51.219
stand up for me? And it was only a couple of days later that I was reading through scripture and in

104
00:29:51.229 --> 00:29:57.800
the gospel of John, it says Jesus tells us that he is sending the Holy Spirit who will be the

105
00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:04.530
advocate. And that was such a word for me. And it was like, Jesus was telling me, you get to relax

106
00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:09.719
Amadea, I see the posture of your heart and that is what is important you're doing what you're doing

107
00:30:09.729 --> 00:30:17.270
for me and I will stand in the gap. I will be your advocate and that changed everything for me. I

108
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.439
could live in peace and relax knowing that Jesus had it.

109
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:33.479
We're in this series called Turning Point and we've been looking at stories in the scriptures and I

110
00:30:33.489 --> 00:30:38.430
feel like we're at a turning point even in our own history as a people, as we've been seeing the

111
00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:43.780
events that have taken place over the last little while in the Middle East, I think there's always

112
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:51.880
been an event there. Um But of late, I think we've been captured by and polarized, maybe by the old

113
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:59.349
events. So I wanted to just take a moment today to, to just pray and pray for peace and pray for

114
00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:05.680
both Israelis and Palestinians. Are we OK to do that together? And so father, we take this moment to

115
00:31:05.689 --> 00:31:12.099
pray for what is happening there, for the leadership that these people are under and for the

116
00:31:12.109 --> 00:31:20.660
governments that they are subjected to, for the rules and the politics and the religion that also

117
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:27.579
guides their decision making for their understanding of not only the past but their present and the

118
00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:34.329
way that they see themselves being able to free themselves from that and forging a new future Lord

119
00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:41.890
without you and without your intervention and without your power for people to experience peace, it

120
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:50.020
cannot be had. And so we pray for peace, we pray that you would comfort the grieving, that you would

121
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:59.270
give wisdom to those making decisions and that you would give insight in a way that you can unblock

122
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:09.619
and set free. All those that are captives, captives to their ideology, to their religion, captives,

123
00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:18.770
to the past and the pain, captives to the trauma and the tragedy. And we pray for freedom in Jesus

124
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:27.709
name. Amen. Amen. Thanks for praying with me today and for taking that step of faith. I realized

125
00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:34.969
that uh there's a lot of uh protests that are going on in the city and there's one that's happening

126
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:40.430
today in place to Canada, but it's for, for peace and it's happening at two o'clock. So if anybody

127
00:32:40.439 --> 00:32:47.560
who's interested in attending that it isn't for one side or the other, it is just for peace and it's

128
00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:53.890
happening at two o'clock in place to Canada. And um it's gonna be something that you might want to

129
00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:02.290
be a part of because it doesn't polarize you in one or the other, but just puts us in this world the

130
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.939
way that Jesus wants us to be, which is to be peacemakers. Can we say Amen to that?

131
00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:16.689
We are called to be peacemakers. That's our mandate. Our mandate is for peace and to be peacemakers.

132
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:23.250
And I pray that we become a people of peace. So I want us to take our attention. The worship said

133
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:29.869
just set things up so beautifully today for the topic in which we're in, which is called, um, step

134
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:39.030
out into the storm and it's so counterintuitive to everything that speaks to what would keep us safe

135
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:46.180
and secure, uh, to what would tell us that this is how you survive this moment. This is how you live

136
00:33:46.189 --> 00:33:54.619
past anything that is assailing you attacking you. I understand that when we hear, step out into the

137
00:33:54.630 --> 00:34:01.109
storm, it's, it's not just counterintuitive. It's, it's just illogical.

138
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:12.138
it's unsafe. You take refuge from a storm, you don't step out into it. And yet that's exactly the

139
00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:17.229
turning point story that we're gonna be looking at. And there are reasons for that. And I believe

140
00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:24.860
that God tells us something in this story that we sometimes might miss out in our everyday journey.

141
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.010
I wanna tell you lessons from this story. It is the lesson of Jesus walking on the water and it

142
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:40.939
appears in, in three out of the four gospels. It appears in Matthew and Mark and in John, but only

143
00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:49.100
in Matthew do we actually learn that Peter also walks on the water. And I think you may be familiar

144
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:55.819
with this story, even if you don't know a lot about scripture or, or Jesus or stories in The New

145
00:34:55.829 --> 00:35:03.030
Testament. I think you have at least heard this reference even in our culture today. And yet the

146
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:12.399
essential point that Matthew was making in this story is one that we often miss. And in this turning

147
00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:17.899
point series, we've been looking at events in the Old Testament and, and today we're looking at this

148
00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:24.800
event in the New Testament because it's been leading us to this moment. And, and what happens is

149
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:30.860
that Matthew, because he is the author of this book, he is speaking to the Hebrew people. He's

150
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:38.020
speaking to the Jews that are both in Israel and outside of Israel. And he's saying to them, I want

151
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:45.580
you to remember that there were two other moments in which there were miracles on the water. And he

152
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:52.780
says the first one, we all know extremely well and it's the Red Sea. It's when Israel was being atta

153
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:59.270
attacked by the Egyptian army and they had the army at their backs and they had the Red Sea at their

154
00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.899
front

155
00:36:02.459 --> 00:36:10.399
and God does something incredible. He parts the waters and in parting, it's not me getting emotional.

156
00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:16.370
I just got something stuck in my throat, but I hope you get emotional soon. So hold on to that.

157
00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:25.719
But what happens is that he's got the Red Sea at their front and when they have the Red Sea at the

158
00:36:25.729 --> 00:36:33.149
front, well, God has to part the waters. This is the only way and he does it through the

159
00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:39.719
instructions that He gives Moses and, and the Red Sea parts and they cross on dry ground. And so

160
00:36:39.729 --> 00:36:47.679
they passed through and this is the key point they passed through the Red Sea. The second instance

161
00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:55.689
is when they had to cross the Jordan river. And the Bible says that again, they passed through this

162
00:36:55.699 --> 00:37:03.209
time with Joshua, not with Moses. And they passed through on dry ground. And so we have, we have

163
00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:10.429
gotten familiar with the idea of having to pass through something and, and I think that it's, it's

164
00:37:10.439 --> 00:37:16.250
kind of captivated our minds and our hearts and the way that we understand life is that we're just

165
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:22.810
gonna have to go through things that we're always gonna have to just pass through them to get to the

166
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:30.139
other side. And, and we, we developed this determination and this grit and, and we, we look at

167
00:37:30.149 --> 00:37:34.979
people who sometimes give up too soon and, and we learn from that and we say, I don't want to be

168
00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:40.770
that or we've looked at moments when we've given up and we didn't persevere and we wondered

169
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:47.760
afterwards, where would I be today if I had just not given up? If I had just continued? The Bible

170
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:55.649
says that you can fall seven times but, but the righteous man keeps getting up, the righteous person

171
00:37:55.659 --> 00:38:00.649
just keeps persevering, doesn't matter how many times you fall, what matters is how many times you

172
00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:06.090
get up. And so we get this mindset where no matter what we're going through, we have to just keep

173
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:12.540
getting up, we have to just keep getting through it. We just have to keep getting past except that

174
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.629
in this story,

175
00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:23.330
during these miracles, the Israelites could only safely pass through the waters. They were never

176
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.030
given the power to walk on them.

177
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:33.659
And I want us to understand that what God does in our lives is that he continually pushes us to

178
00:38:33.669 --> 00:38:34.820
elevate our faith.

179
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.979
And he leads us to a place where we are no longer just satisfied with getting through things.

180
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.060
We're being prepared to walk on them.

181
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:56.649
I want you to capture this moment because it is, it is life changing for you in terms of

182
00:38:56.659 --> 00:39:02.439
understanding what it is that you're going through in your life right now. Because what you are

183
00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:08.850
going through keeps telling you that you have to just keep getting through it

184
00:39:11.379 --> 00:39:19.679
to get to the other side when Jesus has come to not just tell us, we can get through things, we can

185
00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:22.520
walk on them. Are you ready?

186
00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:32.870
You may not be. But by the end of this, I'm going to believe that you will be because I believe that

187
00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:40.050
today God is gonna show us something different than that. Maybe we've understood before. He's gonna

188
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:46.290
take our understanding and elevate. He's gonna take our fear and turn it into faith. He's going to

189
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:52.669
show us that not only can we get through storms, but we can walk on them. Now, God doesn't want you

190
00:39:52.679 --> 00:40:00.860
to just cross through your trouble. God wants you to walk on your storm and that's why Matthew 14,

191
00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:05.860
we're gonna read the back story and the back story is a powerful one because the people had just

192
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:11.820
experienced an incredible miracle and they saw Jesus do something that no one had done before he had

193
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:17.209
fed thousands of people. And then Jesus tells his disciples, I want you to get into a boat and I

194
00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:22.830
want you to go and, and just let me go and spend time with my father. And he goes out into the

195
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:29.030
mountain and he goes and prays and Jesus separates himself from his disciples. And this is where we

196
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:36.550
discover in Matthew 14 in verse 22 that immediately after this, Jesus insisted that, that his

197
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:43.739
disciples get back into the boat, they cross to the other side and he sent the people home. And

198
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:49.139
after sending them home, he went up into the hills by himself to pray and night fell while he was

199
00:40:49.149 --> 00:40:53.629
there alone. And meanwhile, the disciples were in trouble far away from land for a strong wind had

200
00:40:53.639 --> 00:41:00.540
risen and they were fighting heavy waves and about three o'clock in the morning, this is when Jesus

201
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:07.100
comes to them. And this is important. I want you to take note of the hour in which he comes has

202
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:13.850
anything good ever happened at three ami just, just putting it out there. So in verse 26 when the

203
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:19.620
disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and in their fear, they cried out. And

204
00:41:19.629 --> 00:41:27.219
here's, here's the second and most important point here is that it's a ghost. So it's 3 a.m. And

205
00:41:27.229 --> 00:41:33.750
what they're seeing is a ghost. But then Jesus speaks to them and he says, don't be afraid. He said,

206
00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:42.120
take courage. I am here now in Matthew 14, 28 to 33 we're going to now get into the key passage for

207
00:41:42.129 --> 00:41:48.219
today. Now it says that Peter called to him and said, Lord, if it's really, you tell me to come to

208
00:41:48.229 --> 00:41:55.340
you walking on the water. Yes, come Jesus said. And so Peter went over the side of the boat and then

209
00:41:55.350 --> 00:42:01.260
he walks on the water towards Jesus. And when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified

210
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:06.300
and he began to sink and he said, save me, Lord, he shouted and then Jesus immediately reached out

211
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:11.739
and he grabbed them and said, you have so little faith. Jesus said, why did you doubt me? And when

212
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:17.419
they climbed back into the boat, the wind then stopped and the disciples worshiped him. You really

213
00:42:17.429 --> 00:42:27.169
are the Son of God. They exclaimed and this moment shows that they then began to worship Jesus. Now,

214
00:42:27.179 --> 00:42:34.959
how crazy must this have been to witness? Right? But how crazy was, was Peter to get out into the

215
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:41.810
storm? And and the only reason why he gets out into the storm is because Jesus tells him to, he

216
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:48.989
doesn't decide to do this, but Jesus tells him to and he says, I can, I can stop the wind from where

217
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.520
I am.

218
00:42:51.570 --> 00:43:01.600
But I want to show you that I am greater than the events at the Red Sea and I am greater than the

219
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:10.770
events at the Jordan. That I'm not just one who controls the wind and the waves, but I can walk on

220
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:18.419
all the elements of this earth. I have the kind of power that now you will witness

221
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:29.149
is no longer in the shadows of the stories that you have heard. It is now being revealed so that you

222
00:43:29.159 --> 00:43:37.479
can leave your fear behind and step out in faith and understand that I am the Lord who when he calls

223
00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:38.439
out to you,

224
00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:50.209
not only can I make you walk on dry ground, I can actually make you walk on the water. Iii I wanna

225
00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:57.379
believe in a Jesus who calls me out onto the water. I I don't want him to just take care of my

226
00:43:57.399 --> 00:44:03.370
problem and give me the courage that I need to kind of walk through it. You know, to give me the

227
00:44:03.379 --> 00:44:10.270
kind of perseverance and persistence that I need to just get through things. I want him to give me

228
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:18.199
the power to also walk upon them, to elevate to the point where I know that I'm beyond even the

229
00:44:18.209 --> 00:44:25.709
trouble that I'm facing and the difficulty of the crossing and the circumstances that are calling me

230
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:31.060
to stop believing that anything can be different than what I'm experiencing and living out in the

231
00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:38.560
moment. And I, and I begin to think that ever since Peter began to sink in this story, we have done

232
00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:46.810
nothing but criticize Peter, but no one else had the courage to get out of that boat. And I think it

233
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:54.709
is so pivotal for us to understand this because when God calls on you to step out into the storm,

234
00:44:55.179 --> 00:45:03.929
how many of us actually step out over the boat, out of the boat and onto the water? And I, I think

235
00:45:03.939 --> 00:45:09.929
about this a lot in my life and I think about how often I, I'm just afraid to just go out into the

236
00:45:09.939 --> 00:45:16.250
storm. I'd rather take refuge from it, hide from it and believe and hope that it's just gonna pass

237
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:23.209
me by. What else can we do? But, but, but protect ourselves and take refuge by, by boarding

238
00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:30.830
ourselves in or finding a place that is strong and secure so that if something does get blown away,

239
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:38.080
we don't get blown away by it that no matter how powerful the wind is, it doesn't hold us back from

240
00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:46.310
being able to still withstand it and, and, and resist it instead of always having the tendency to

241
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:54.510
run from it. I, I realize that it, it's not intuitive. I know that what God is asking us to do just

242
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:59.689
defies any kind of understanding that we've previously had. But we need to pay attention to what

243
00:45:59.699 --> 00:46:07.780
happens in this story because to take the next step of faith in overcoming fear, you're gonna see

244
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:11.780
that God is calling you to step out into the storm.

245
00:46:14.919 --> 00:46:23.070
And if you don't see that moment, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna stay in your place of

246
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:29.149
fear. You're not going to experience the next thing that God has in store for you, you're just gonna

247
00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:35.669
keep reliving storm after storm instead of learning how to walk on the water. Are you ready to walk

248
00:46:35.679 --> 00:46:39.439
on the water instead? Are we, are we for real?

249
00:46:43.709 --> 00:46:48.169
And, and I, I think that what Jesus does is that he, he always fulfills the scriptures. That's why

250
00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:55.310
he has to also reveal how he's, he's better than the events of the past. And, and I think that when

251
00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.739
God has shown up in your life in the past, he's shown up in a very clear and specific way and you

252
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.719
know, He's helped you cross things and get through things and get past things and overcome things.

253
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.669
But now God is saying it's time to take the next step.

254
00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:17.770
It's time for you to face the storm. I need you to step out of the boat and face the storm. I want

255
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.629
you to get into it and I want you to see that nothing changes, nothing changes. I'm still here for

256
00:47:23.639 --> 00:47:27.350
you. I'm just gonna show you a different way to overcome it.

257
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:35.699
And what's beautiful is that in Isaiah? He fulfills this pass in, in this passage in, in chapter 43

258
00:47:35.709 --> 00:47:44.989
verse two, it says, and this is God already made this promise God already made it. He already made

259
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.479
it. So now what He wants to do is He wants to fulfill it in our lives. And it says this in verse two,

260
00:47:51.510 --> 00:48:01.000
when you go through deep waters, I'm gonna be with you. And when you go through rivers of difficulty,

261
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:12.229
you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up, the

262
00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:22.949
flames will not consume. You are beautiful. Can you make that promise yours today? Can you make it

263
00:48:22.959 --> 00:48:33.979
so that it's your word for your situation? You see, we looked at the passage in the back story of

264
00:48:33.989 --> 00:48:40.110
how Jesus leaves them and they're on their own. And sometimes we felt abandoned by God. I, I know I

265
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:45.939
have, I felt like he hasn't been present and he was absent and the things maybe it could have been

266
00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:50.199
avoided if he was just there to stop them from happening in the first place. Anybody else feel like

267
00:48:50.209 --> 00:48:54.870
that like these guys are on the boat and they're, and they're, they're fighting the storm of their

268
00:48:54.879 --> 00:48:59.080
lives. The thing is that we don't realize that these guys were, were seasoned veterans of the sea

269
00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:05.149
like they, they knew this, they knew this life better than Jesus did. Jesus was a carpenter, he

270
00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:12.969
wasn't a fisherman, he didn't know how to navigate the sea, but even in the life in which they had

271
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.030
10,000 hours of expertise. Have you ever hear that you need 10,000 hours to become an expert at

272
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:27.540
something, even though they had that, that they were experts, they knew they were now out of options

273
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:28.310
and out of hope.

274
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:36.919
That's how fear took a hold of them because they went beyond what they knew they could get out of on

275
00:49:36.929 --> 00:49:42.479
their own. And that's when fear grips us, right, when it's beyond us and we know it. And some of us

276
00:49:42.489 --> 00:49:45.939
get there sometimes quicker than others because we just

277
00:49:48.129 --> 00:49:52.629
sometimes just aren't prepared the way others have. They haven't

278
00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:01.030
given up as often. Maybe they can say that their faith is a little bit stronger because of the

279
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:07.989
things that they've gone through. And so we sometimes compare ourselves and have you heard this

280
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.360
before? That com comparison is the thief of joy.

281
00:50:14.399 --> 00:50:21.659
And a lot of us are always comparing ourselves to other people in their faith and, and it steals

282
00:50:21.669 --> 00:50:27.639
from us, not just joy, but the opportunity to experience greater faith. See, see, God is not

283
00:50:27.649 --> 00:50:36.320
comparing you to someone else. He's trying to get you to be a better version of yourself. That's

284
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:43.500
what God is interested in. He's interested in you, achieving greater things going beyond the limits

285
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:48.850
that have held you back, being the person that He knows that you were always meant to be to do the

286
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:57.040
things that He knows you were always meant to do. He wants you to not just get through things but to

287
00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:02.760
walk on the water. And here's the first thing that he tells us to do in this story.

288
00:51:05.449 --> 00:51:12.840
He says, I want you to start looking for Jesus and I want you to stop seeing ghosts.

289
00:51:18.739 --> 00:51:23.520
I think the ghosts speak to us about dwelling on the past.

290
00:51:25.639 --> 00:51:36.800
I think ghosts speak to us of that which can cause fear and trepidation in the most strong hearted

291
00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:45.669
and strong willed mind. When you see something that you think has come back from the dead, I don't

292
00:51:45.679 --> 00:51:52.360
care how strong your faith is, I think there's gonna be a bit of fear. True? But I feel like most of

293
00:51:52.370 --> 00:52:00.870
us haven't understood that if we stop dwelling on the past, we can start believing in our future.

294
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:11.280
And many of us in this room are held back by our past. More than we're concerned about going to

295
00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:14.739
where Jesus is calling us to, which is our future.

296
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:23.719
I know that you have had a hard time. I know that you have had trauma and tragedies in your life. I

297
00:52:23.729 --> 00:52:29.939
know that each and every one of us, if we took just a few moments to share the deepest pains and

298
00:52:29.949 --> 00:52:37.449
hurts that we've gone through. I know we would all have a lot to share. True or not true. A lot. But

299
00:52:37.459 --> 00:52:42.889
some of us are more stuck than others. And I'll tell you why because we're still dwelling on the

300
00:52:42.899 --> 00:52:49.909
past because we are still seeing ghosts instead of seeing the Lord who's on the water. But here's

301
00:52:49.919 --> 00:53:00.949
the problem. You can't see that. It's Jesus because all you're doing is seeing ghosts. Hm. How could

302
00:53:00.959 --> 00:53:07.939
these guys who knew Jesus so well? Not see that. It was Jesus. I'll tell you why because there's no

303
00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:11.850
place in our hearts for both fear and faith to coexist

304
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.159
fear will always overcome faith

305
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:29.669
if we are governed by our ghosts, but faith will overcome fear. If we're looking for Jesus instead.

306
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:36.340
Come on. Come on. Come on. Right.

307
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:45.419
And when is this gonna happen? It's gonna happen at the most unlikely time.

308
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.979
It's gonna happen at 3 a.m. It's gonna, the, the time is important because it's gonna come when you

309
00:53:52.989 --> 00:53:59.620
don't expect it. And, and if you're, if you're believing in ghosts, you're gonna see ghosts.

310
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:09.229
But if you're believing in Jesus, you're going to have the opportunity to hear what he's telling you

311
00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:18.189
to do. And instead of staying in the boat thinking that's the safe place, you're gonna step out into

312
00:54:18.199 --> 00:54:22.060
the storm, which is the real place where God has wanted you all along.

313
00:54:24.669 --> 00:54:32.159
And so God is saying, look for the next steps that I want you to take and, and I love that Peter

314
00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:37.610
takes the first step out of the boat and takes the second step onto the water and he keeps walking

315
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:44.080
on the water as long as it focuses on Jesus and, and the moment that he starts to pay attention to

316
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:50.790
what's in the wind and pay attention to the water and, and maybe how far Jesus is, maybe Jesus isn't

317
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:56.760
getting any closer. You know, sometimes you take steps towards a destination and it just feels like

318
00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:01.350
it's getting further from you. Anybody ever had that experience? Like I'm, I'm living it right now

319
00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:08.000
in my own life. II, I feel like every step that I take the, the goal is just further, further and

320
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:13.239
further from me. Anybody else feel like that that's happening in your life. It's like everything

321
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:19.389
that you're doing, right doesn't get the goal any closer. But, but here's the thing, if we keep our

322
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:29.010
focus on Jesus before you know it, he is right in front of us and, and the moment that Peter begins

323
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:36.570
to think, I love this because it's so true for not just my past but for yours, Jesus was there to

324
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.429
pull us out of the water anyways.

325
00:55:41.169 --> 00:55:46.570
And the Bible says that he gets him back into the boat just like we need to get back into the boat.

326
00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:52.510
The plan is not for us to keep walking on the water. It's, it's for us to get back into the boat and

327
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.229
to worship him.

328
00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:02.280
But we have to get out into the storm to have something to worship him for. You see, we're not gonna

329
00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:09.129
be able to do that. And until all human possibilities and until all hope was gone. That's when Jesus

330
00:56:09.139 --> 00:56:18.449
says, obey and, and if, if Peter doesn't obey, like the command came to all of them, but only Peter

331
00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:23.600
is the one who responded. And I believe that the reason we don't experience more in our life is

332
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:30.790
because we're not obeying to the level that Jesus is calling us to. And so when he calls you to step

333
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:37.689
out into the storm, it's just, it's just your act of obedience. What is it? What is God asking you

334
00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:44.280
to trust Him with and trust him for? I don't know what it is for you. I know what it is for me. I

335
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.570
know, you know how I know, you know how I know it's so clear in my life because I've been

336
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:55.209
disobedient to it so many times anybody else see in an area of your life where you're constantly

337
00:56:55.219 --> 00:56:59.040
being disobedient, you know exactly where God is asking you to be

338
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:06.739
and when He calls on you to obey it, it's not because He wants to make things hard for you. It's

339
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:13.540
because He wants to deliver you. He wants to give you his best. And that's when Jesus says, come to

340
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:21.479
me obey. And that's when we have to say Jesus, what's the next step? And just keep taking that? And

341
00:57:21.489 --> 00:57:29.040
I love that. The next thing that he says in the story is, look for how your faith is being tested

342
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:37.080
and how your fears are being revealed. I, I know that when Jesus is calling on us to take a step out

343
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:44.320
of the boat and a step onto the water that he's actually asking us to pay attention to what we're

344
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:51.360
actually afraid of. And so when he calls on us to step out into the storm, he's saying this is what

345
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:58.870
you're afraid of. Does anybody have like a worst case scenario kind of mindset? It's like you, you

346
00:57:58.879 --> 00:58:05.300
tend to just articulate all the things that are gonna go wrong and that could go wrong and you, you

347
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:14.419
find yourself not not wanting to be that way, obviously, but that's, that's how you kind of work and,

348
00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:19.479
and you don't want to speak these things, but you find yourself speaking them anyways

349
00:58:21.649 --> 00:58:27.889
and it's not that speaking them is just going to make them happen. But what I've come to realize is

350
00:58:27.899 --> 00:58:35.260
that we tend to go in the direction of our words and our thoughts and, and even when my words aren't

351
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:43.209
being spoken, I tend to go in the direction of my thoughts and, and the scriptures does, does say in

352
00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:45.570
proverbs that as a person thinks

353
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:51.020
that's who they become.

354
00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:03.310
And so if I'm dwelling on these things, I'm being directed by these things and I'm choosing a

355
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:12.469
direction by these things. And God is saying, look for how your faith is being tested because that's

356
00:59:12.479 --> 00:59:19.199
where your fears are being revealed. And when your fears are revealed, God exposes them so that He

357
00:59:19.209 --> 00:59:25.590
can take that weakness and he can turn it into a strength. God is saying I am not shocked by your

358
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:34.429
weakness. What I want is for that weakness to stop being so powerful in your life. I want to take

359
00:59:34.439 --> 00:59:41.209
that weakness and I want to turn it into a strength. I want your mind to be positive. I want you to

360
00:59:41.219 --> 00:59:49.560
dwell on my promises. I want you to be a person of purpose and not being driven and directed by the

361
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:56.409
things that are prevailing in your mind that are being led by fear. I want you to instead be a

362
00:59:56.419 --> 01:00:04.459
person of faith. And when I call on you, I want you to step out into the storm. And what Jesus

363
01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:11.360
wanted everyone to see and for us to understand is that the raging sea was nothing but a set of steps

364
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:20.219
for Jesus to walk on and for Him to get to His disciples because there is no place for fear and

365
01:00:20.229 --> 01:00:29.320
faith to coexist in our hearts. Because when it does, it destroys our focus and our ability to walk

366
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:38.899
on the storm. Here's the next thing. Look for how your faith will unleash the supernatural. What God

367
01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:45.340
is showing Peter is that he can do something that he could never otherwise do. If he just stepped

368
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:54.389
out in obedience, that which is impossible, can become possible. That's which no one has ever done.

369
01:00:55.689 --> 01:01:02.129
You can be the first to do see this is what the story of Peter reveals. I don't know what you're

370
01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:08.689
gonna become the first to do in your home, in your life, in your household for your generation. But

371
01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:16.020
I believe that all of us have been called to be first. All of us have been called to do something

372
01:01:16.169 --> 01:01:25.229
that breaks the generational tendencies that have held us back to this very day where we are still

373
01:01:25.239 --> 01:01:32.860
seeing ghosts instead of seeing Jesus and the power that he can unleash in our lives. And I know

374
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:38.340
that it's not always something that we're doing or something that we've done. I know that it's

375
01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:46.260
something that people have done and have done to us. But there is no moment in which people are in

376
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.419
control

377
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:59.050
and they are unlimited in their control. There is always a moment in which we read earlier that if

378
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:05.199
there are deep waters, we can cross them. If there are challenging rivers, we can overcome them. If

379
01:02:05.209 --> 01:02:11.649
there's a consuming fire, we will not be burned by it. And there's a story in which the friends of

380
01:02:11.659 --> 01:02:18.790
Daniel get thrown into a furnace, the people who had the right to make that law and the people who

381
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:25.439
had the power to enact that law and the people who stood there with authority holding on to those

382
01:02:25.449 --> 01:02:32.899
men who had been bound and had the authority to take them and throw them into the furnace. It didn't

383
01:02:32.909 --> 01:02:37.790
change the fact that when they put three people in the furnace, there was 1/4

384
01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:49.879
and they came out of the fire and they had to be released because there's never a moment in which

385
01:02:51.340 --> 01:03:03.600
people are in power over the power of the Lord himself. The Lord is still the ultimate power. And if

386
01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:10.550
he's with you, then that's the only thing you need to get through whatever it is. But more

387
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:18.969
importantly to step out into the storm in faith and believe that there is nothing that can touch you

388
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.159
because Jesus Christ himself is with you. You believe that for yourself,

389
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:38.399
you see Jesus wants us to understand this today. He wants you to look out to worship him on land.

390
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:50.969
He wants you to worship him out on the water and he wants you to worship him in the boat. This story

391
01:03:50.979 --> 01:03:57.159
is the first time that the disciples worshiped Jesus as God. Do you know that the first time it

392
01:03:57.169 --> 01:04:02.570
happens in the, in the, in the New Testament? But it isn't the first time that Jesus is worshiped.

393
01:04:03.649 --> 01:04:11.620
The first time that Jesus worshiped was actually the mag J the wise men that came from the east. The

394
01:04:11.629 --> 01:04:18.659
second time was a leper who had been healed. He worships Jesus. The third time was a synagogue ruler

395
01:04:18.669 --> 01:04:28.790
who worshiped Jesus because he recognized that he was before the promised Messiah. But this is the

396
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:37.070
first time that the disciples do it. This is where they call him God and they worship Him. This is

397
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:43.580
the first time that the Lord Jesus spoke of Peter's little faith, but then showed us that a little

398
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:50.350
bit of faith is better than no faith at all. That a little bit of faith can get you out on the water

399
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:59.290
that a little bit of faith can get you out into the storm. That a little bit of faith can get you to

400
01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:06.129
worship God in a way that opens up your mind and heart. Like never before you see, when they finally

401
01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:13.419
got back into the boat, they saw Jesus completely different. They'd already seen his miracles. They

402
01:05:13.429 --> 01:05:17.629
already experienced his teaching. They already saw that he was better than anybody that they had

403
01:05:17.639 --> 01:05:24.699
ever heard or followed before. What they saw now was someone who had power over everything and they

404
01:05:24.709 --> 01:05:30.090
knew only God had this. And so they were able to worship Him. You see, you need to get to that place

405
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:35.530
in your life where you just stop seeing Jesus, the religious teacher. You stop seeing Jesus, the

406
01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:41.850
good rabbi. You stop seeing Jesus as the moral compass of your life that you stop seeing. Jesus is

407
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:47.409
just one of the many faiths. And you start seeing Him as the God who has called you out into the

408
01:05:47.419 --> 01:05:53.209
storm is the God who gives you the ability to experience the supernatural in your life is the God

409
01:05:53.219 --> 01:05:58.729
who helps you to walk on the water. The God who makes it possible for you to get back into the boat

410
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:05.719
and there you can come before him and worship him because you have gone through something now that

411
01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:10.840
you will forever be changed by because now you've left your fear behind. You're not seeing ghosts

412
01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:12.909
anymore. The only thing you're seeing is Jesus.

413
01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:21.469
So you're not afraid of what time it is. You're not afraid of what the wind is doing and what the

414
01:06:21.479 --> 01:06:27.229
waves are going to do. You're not afraid of the fact that you had to go out there on your own. No

415
01:06:27.239 --> 01:06:34.250
one followed you. You don't have to worry about what you don't have because you've understood that

416
01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:41.879
you have now everything that you've ever needed, you have Jesus the supernatural with you in you for

417
01:06:41.889 --> 01:06:48.689
you before you preparing all things so that you can step out into the storm and be victorious. God

418
01:06:48.699 --> 01:06:50.129
bless you guys. Thank you so much.

419
01:06:57.979 --> 01:07:04.139
And as the worship team comes up and leads us into this last song and we get to enjoy Thanksgiving

420
01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:09.889
because it's River's Edge. We celebrate Thanksgiving two weeks in a row. Nobody else does this. E

421
01:07:10.959 --> 01:07:17.229
we're, we're the only ones crazy enough to do it last week and this week. Um But I wanna read this

422
01:07:17.239 --> 01:07:22.659
verse together. Would you just stand and we don't do a lot of this, but maybe we should do it more.

423
01:07:23.969 --> 01:07:30.639
Um And, and you know, it's all about timing and pacing, but when we read corporately God's word

424
01:07:30.649 --> 01:07:37.580
together. We're also saying that we are believing in the promise that He has made and I will stand

425
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:44.419
on his power and his truth. And I'll believe this for my life. And, and the thing about Job chapter

426
01:07:44.429 --> 01:07:45.340
nine, verse eight,

427
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:57.169
it says this and we're gonna read it together. He alone has spread out the heavens and marches on

428
01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:06.149
the waves of the sea. We do it again. He alone has spread out the heavens and he marches on the

429
01:08:06.159 --> 01:08:14.290
waves of the sea. We believe that. Will you believe that for yourself? Amen. Let's do that.

430
01:08:17.089 --> 01:08:23.370
Let's sing this song together. And I pray father right now that we would become the people of faith

431
01:08:23.379 --> 01:08:31.529
that no longer hold fear in their hearts that you would dispel it as we reject it, we resist it.

432
01:08:32.369 --> 01:08:37.708
We're not gonna run from you. We're gonna run to you. We're gonna obey in the area of our life where

433
01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:40.028
we need it most. And today, Lord, if you're being

434
01:08:42.039 --> 01:08:47.349
the God of the supernatural for us, I pray that we would trust you that we would look and put our

435
01:08:47.358 --> 01:08:55.129
focus on you and that we would recognize through faith that it's you calling us out on those waters.

436
01:08:56.269 --> 01:09:01.659
And we pray this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's sing this song together. Would you wish your

437
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:05.220
I am

438
01:09:10.879 --> 01:09:12.740
to put our focus on Jesus.

439
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:23.999
