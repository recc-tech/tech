1
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.700
Join me and stand as we would just kick this gathering off. And we are so excited that you could be

2
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:11.559
with us. And to be a part of this experience for us on a week to week basis is about encountering

3
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:20.130
God, but also about experiencing community. And those two things are what this is about. And we are

4
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:27.500
so glad that you could be with us as you would find time in our busy schedules to meet, not only

5
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:33.210
with God, but with each other. And so I pray that this would become a community of faith that you

6
00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:38.859
would feel that you already belong to that even if you're at a different place on your spiritual

7
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:44.559
journey. And maybe just, maybe you don't even quite believe yet. We want you to know that you

8
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:51.760
already belong. And so we want to welcome you and accept you the way you are because that's what God

9
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:59.960
does and he leads us into following Jesus so that we can become like Him. It's not about being like

10
00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:08.530
Him right now, but it's about committing to becoming like Him and he is here to help us to fulfill

11
00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:15.780
that and accomplish that through faith, love and hope. And so I pray that we would worship together

12
00:10:15.789 --> 00:10:24.539
today as we would experience God and we would experience him through community. And so let's worship

13
00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:27.239
together. Let's welcome the River's Edge worship team.

14
00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:38.559
The first song we're gonna sing is called open the eyes of my heart. To see and hear the hidden

15
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:48.260
things of God requires spiritual eyes and ears. Hunger for spiritual truth, requires awakened senses

16
00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:56.840
and to love the things of God requires a new heart. God alone is the source of spiritual eyes and

17
00:10:56.849 --> 00:11:02.340
undivided hearts. So let's ask God to open our eyes.

18
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:21.890
What

19
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:34.200
want

20
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.210
but

21
00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:51.580
want to

22
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:54.599
Yeah.

23
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.500
What

24
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:33.080

25
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.929
Holy, holy.

26
00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:32.539
Oh

27
00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:42.070
Holy. I want to see you. Let's see.

I want to see

34
00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:38.460
open. Who,

35
00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:43.539
what

36
00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:53.250
I want to see?

37
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.450
Last one who

38
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:03.909
hope

39
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.429
I just

40
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:36.669
let us make Jesus the center of our life in our church. He's a second center of it.

41
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.309
The

42
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:53.780
from beginning to the end, it will always be

43
00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:57.309

81
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:11.040
dismiss the kids right now and so kids just make your way over to the check in. Uh your teachers are

82
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:17.890
waiting for you. I know you're gonna have a great Sunday. We have such amazing teachers and a great

83
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:25.400
program and we're excited about being able to introduce kids worship. Um in just a few weeks, we're

84
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:30.660
working on scheduling that and uh as soon as that's ready to go, we'll be announcing that on a

85
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:38.369
Sunday like this and uh there'll be live worship for the kids um going forward. Uh We also wanted to

86
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:44.130
tell you that today at four o'clock, um there's a concert that's happening here and it's to benefit

87
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:55.869
um the war torn victims in Ukraine and it's uh being uh put on by the Aurora Chorealis choir. And so

88
00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.400
if you'd like to be a part of that, there will be tickets that will be available at the door. It's

89
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:11.089
$20 for adults and $15 for students. And this is happening today at four o'clock right here. We're

90
00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:18.150
hosting this event and we have a great facility for that and a lot of equipment required to put that

91
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:26.729
on. And so we are glad to be able to partner with this choir in being able to do this today. We also

92
00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:36.130
have another event that's important and that is our women's ministry. We call it girls and it's for

93
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:43.359
girls of all ages as well as all stages of life. And there's an event that is happening on Saturday,

94
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:51.569
June the 17th and it's going to be taking place at 10 AM right here at River's Edge and the theme is

95
00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:59.569
unlikely royalty. And it's a story of a woman in the Bible who is chosen as part of the genealogy of

96
00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:06.819
Jesus and Patricia will be speaking on that topic as well as we have members of our worship team

97
00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:14.199
that will be leading us in worship. We have an incredible spread of baked goods and tea that will be

98
00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:19.479
provided and just some other fun surprises as well. It's an event that you definitely don't want to

99
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:25.239
miss and bring someone with you to it. We have a sign up sheet, but if you didn't sign up and you

100
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:31.390
still want to attend on the day, then please do the thing that we really need more than anything is

101
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:38.229
to know, uh, if you need child care because we offer child care and we want to know how many people

102
00:28:38.239 --> 00:28:44.140
would be bringing Children with them so that we can be properly prepared in entertaining your kids

103
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:51.189
and making sure that you can enjoy that event, worry free. And so make it a point to sign up today

104
00:28:51.199 --> 00:28:58.599
at the info table at the back and uh put your name down or put someone's name down for them and then

105
00:28:58.609 --> 00:29:04.449
make sure that they show up that always works too. Another event that we have coming up of course is

106
00:29:04.459 --> 00:29:12.099
in two weeks time. One of the greatest holidays of all time is Father's Day and Father's Day. You

107
00:29:12.109 --> 00:29:20.020
disagree. Why are you laughing? My daughter was born on Father's Day. Isn't that interesting? Yeah.

108
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:29.959
Yeah, it was a special moment for me. Um And I haven't had many since then, but just joking. So, but

109
00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:37.920
Father's Day is coming up in two weeks time and we are going to also launch a beautiful ministry

110
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:43.500
that we are calling guys. Does that make sense? Since we have one that's called girls that we would

111
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:50.359
have one for the guys that's named guys. So a men's ministry called Guys is going to be launched on

112
00:29:50.369 --> 00:29:55.189
that day. We're going to share more about what our guys ministry is going to do at River's Edge and

113
00:29:55.199 --> 00:30:01.380
the plans that we have moving forward with that ministry. But on that day because we know that men

114
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:08.699
love brunch community kitchen is serving brunch on Father's Day. That amazing.

115
00:30:11.579 --> 00:30:18.719
So, and I thought it was perfect because if there's one thing I know guys want is two brunches on

116
00:30:18.729 --> 00:30:25.180
the same day, the one at the church and then one that's be obligated by their family members to give

117
00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:30.599
them. And so if you can get the second one, well, you always can count on the first one. And so

118
00:30:30.609 --> 00:30:37.430
we'll offer that on the 18th. And so we are gonna talk to you guys more about that next week and

119
00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:41.839
what we have planned for you. But right now, I want to tell you about a worship night that's coming

120
00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:48.650
up and it's on Friday, June the 23rd. This is put on by our young adult ministry at River's Edge.

121
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.910
Can we give it up for our young adults? It's amazing.

122
00:30:54.619 --> 00:31:00.280
And on that night, there's going to probably be about something around 15 to 18 songs, different

123
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:06.520
leaders leading worship on that night, a great group of singers and musicians that are going to lead

124
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:12.420
us into worship. And I'm excited to be a part of that and excited for you to be a part of that as

125
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:18.400
well. And so if you haven't made any plans that weekend, make sure that they include this worship

126
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:23.189
night that's going to be happening on the 23rd. I want to thank those that have stepped up to kind

127
00:31:23.199 --> 00:31:28.150
of make their way over to the South booth and say, hey, I'm willing to check out sound and live

128
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:35.229
stream as well as visuals. And we've gotten the chance to train some people on that. And we are

129
00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:41.209
looking forward to meeting you if you haven't found a place to serve at River's Edge yet. This is a

130
00:31:41.219 --> 00:31:47.349
great way that you can get involved once a month and possibly once every two months, depending on

131
00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:52.520
what your schedule can allow. But we want to help you get connected. And one of the ways you can do

132
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:58.260
that by meeting other people is also by serving, not only can you give to this community, but you

133
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.020
can make some amazing friendships through it. And so we encourage you to check out the tech team and

134
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:07.469
speak to someone today. We also have four ways to give and we thank you for your generosity. And as

135
00:32:07.479 --> 00:32:14.449
we enter into the summer months, we know that this can sometimes affect our giving. We want you to

136
00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:20.339
just plan ahead for that and just realize that you can always give from wherever you are. Also with

137
00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:25.310
two apps that we have. One of them is called Tithely. The other one is called Canada Helps. So if you

138
00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:31.569
can't be here in person and you can give also through e transfer, and we do count on those finances

139
00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:36.290
to be able to do all the things that we've been talking about today. Everything that we offer is

140
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.800
because of the donations that come in. And so that's just a glimpse of what we can do. But we would

141
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:47.410
love to do so much more in the weeks and months to come. And that's how we're going to grow as a

142
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:53.030
community of faith is also through the financial support that we receive to make things happen like

143
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.709
we talked about today. And so we're going to transition now into the message. And today's message is

144
00:32:58.719 --> 00:33:02.359
called peace of mind through prayer and fasting.

145
00:33:14.609 --> 00:33:20.640
So we're in this series called peace and unlocking new levels of it. And this is the second to last

146
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:27.500
message I have one next week. It is called peace of mind through presence. And that's God's presence.

147
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.920
But today, we're going to look at this topic of prayer and fasting. And I think we're going to

148
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:36.770
demystify some things with regards to it. And we're going to begin just by quickly looking at this

149
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.810
passage of scripture that is found in second chronicles chapter 20. And we're going to begin reading

150
00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:47.089
at verse one all the way to verse 13. It's a great story that goes beyond verse 13. But I'll talk

151
00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:53.040
about those points in the message itself. But the 1st 13 verses give us the foundation that we need

152
00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.670
to really understand what we're talking about today. And so let's take a look at verse one. It says

153
00:36:24.419 --> 00:36:32.330
God bless the reading of his word to our hearts. Amen. It's a beautiful story in which we see

154
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:38.790
that calamity has indeed come to their doorstep. And the news that comes to Jehoshaphat obviously

155
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:44.810
brings a lot of anxiety and worry. It disrupts the peace that he had in his mind before the moment

156
00:36:44.909 --> 00:36:51.409
when he received the news. And I think that at different times in our life, we've received news of

157
00:36:51.419 --> 00:36:57.050
something that would have disrupted our peace. And the principles that are in this story are the

158
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:02.169
principles that we can put into practice when this comes to our doorstep. When it comes into our

159
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:13.149
lives, when it breaches our walls and comes into our kingdom and finds itself inhabiting the minds

160
00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:21.530
and hearts of those that we would want to protect you. See, in this story, it's a story of how

161
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.850
sometimes it's time to stop everything and just pray.

162
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:35.409
And I feel like sometimes we just don't do that. We just kind of continue life as per usual. It

163
00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:41.659
doesn't matter what the news is, it doesn't seem to, to strike enough fear in us to, to make us

164
00:37:41.669 --> 00:37:47.129
reconsider what our next steps are. And I feel like if we are people of God and understand who God

165
00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:51.770
is and, and what he wants us to do next, and we would understand that what we would need to do next

166
00:37:51.780 --> 00:38:00.389
is actually stop everything and pray and then not stop and be paralyzed by fear, not stop and be

167
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:10.770
powerless by worry and anxiety, but instead stop everything and pray because therein lies all the

168
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:19.320
power that we need. And what Jehoshaphat does is the king is that he calls his people together. And he

169
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:26.580
says this is what we're going to do. Now. He had the power to tell everyone to stop everything and

170
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:32.060
to pray. And so everyone stopped everything because he realized that it wasn't going to be enough if

171
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:38.139
he stopped everything. See sometimes in our lives, the things are so serious that other people have

172
00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:44.520
to stop everything and pray with us. We're not going to see the victory that we need to see if other

173
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:52.219
people don't join us and pray with us. We want to see power, but we're not going to be able to see

174
00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:56.419
it and experience it unless other people join us in prayer.

175
00:38:58.429 --> 00:39:04.389
The people that are in this kingdom are the ones that are at risk. The people of Judah are the ones

176
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:11.340
who need to stop everything. And there are times when we have a household that's divided and the

177
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:18.419
very person that we need to pray with us is not able to pray because they don't have the same belief.

178
00:39:19.959 --> 00:39:25.830
It doesn't bother us when we're dating. It doesn't bother us when we're having sexual relations. It

179
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:32.050
doesn't bother us when we're out there partying and out there doing life together, but it will

180
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:37.850
ultimately bother you the most when the time comes to pray and you don't have someone to do it with.

181
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:44.379
It is then in those moments that you'll realize that the person that you're with isn't a person who

182
00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:52.659
can join you in power to pray and be able to stop everything because not, are you not just in a

183
00:39:52.669 --> 00:40:00.250
position where you're being attacked? Everything that you have is under attack. It's not just what's

184
00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:06.439
in your present, it's what's in your future. And there's those moments that we realize, you know,

185
00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:12.449
why didn't I make a better decision? Why did I make a better choice? Why didn't I take a better step?

186
00:40:12.459 --> 00:40:14.389
Why didn't I do things differently?

187
00:40:16.669 --> 00:40:24.520
And so we need to sometimes go outside of our own household and immediate context of who we have in

188
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:34.699
a relationship and say, I don't have this with so and so, but can you join with me and pray? And

189
00:40:34.709 --> 00:40:42.179
that's when you begin to understand the value of community that is spiritual because there are

190
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:47.010
moments in your life when you can't have that in your own household because sometimes you're just

191
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:53.689
simply doing life alone. Maybe this is a stage in your life where you are alone spiritually, but

192
00:40:53.699 --> 00:41:00.629
you're never alone because God brings people into your life so that you can experience His power and

193
00:41:00.639 --> 00:41:05.209
have everyone stop everything and pray with you.

194
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:13.560
And so when we find ourselves in need, we can turn to people and say, hey, can you do this with me?

195
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.810
Because this is what happened to Jehoshaphat. He, the Bible tells us that he was terrified by the

196
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.439
news. Look at what it says in second chronicles chapter 20 verse three,

197
00:41:26.449 --> 00:41:35.419
he was terrified. And the Bible says that he actually begs the Lord for guidance. And as he begs the

198
00:41:35.429 --> 00:41:44.250
Lord for guidance, he orders everyone in Judah to begin fasting. Now, when we stop everything to

199
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:55.540
pray, it means that food no longer has importance. It means that working as you normally would no

200
00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:06.899
longer is of importance. It means whatever it is that you were doing, you stop fasting means taking

201
00:42:06.909 --> 00:42:15.669
a break from all the things that were in your regular activity and you seek God instead. And you're

202
00:42:15.679 --> 00:42:20.520
saying, But how can I do that when I have responsibilities when there's a role that I need to

203
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:27.850
fulfill? If I stop my, my, my boss is going to fire me. If I stop, my Children are not going to be

204
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:33.560
able to have what they need. If I stop, my husband is not going to have any clean underwear,

205
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:42.570
whatever it is that happens in a household, we sometimes wonder how can people and life manage

206
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:52.030
without us. But here's the truth. How can we possibly manage the next moments without God? And if we

207
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:58.070
consider all those things more important than God, then here's what we're saying. We're saying that

208
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:04.520
we can get through this somehow on our own. But what Jehoshaphat recognizes is that that's not true.

209
00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:14.000
It's time to stop everything. And then the next thing that He does is that He turns to God and he

210
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:22.689
reminds God of his own promises. He reminds God of the story of his own people. He reminds God of

211
00:43:22.699 --> 00:43:30.270
all the things that He knows that God knows, but he wants to say it out loud because it's going to

212
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:38.169
strengthen not only His faith, his resolve, but that of the people. And so what we see in the story

213
00:43:38.179 --> 00:43:44.000
and it's important to point out is that it's not just time to stop everything and pray, but it's

214
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:51.340
time to pray God's promises. And that's what He does from verse six to verse nine. Look at what He

215
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:59.679
does look who put it up on the screen. He says, you're the God of our ancestors. You alone are the

216
00:43:59.689 --> 00:44:04.110
ruler of all the kingdoms of the earth. It doesn't matter who comes against us, you're powerful,

217
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:11.270
you're mighty. No one can stand against you. You drive out those who lived in this land and now

218
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:16.639
these are the people that we spared and now they're attacking us. You told us not to attack them. So

219
00:44:16.649 --> 00:44:19.989
we didn't, now they're coming for us. What are you going to do about it?

220
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.469
What are you gonna do about it?

221
00:44:26.689 --> 00:44:27.340
These are

222
00:44:29.399 --> 00:44:38.090
not people who were our enemies, but now they are. And so isn't your presence in your temple that

223
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:48.540
you told us to build? Aren't you with the arc and the tablets and the staff aren't you with us? And

224
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:54.489
aren't we going to be able to cry out to you the way that you told us to so you could save us so you

225
00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:01.899
could hear us and so that you could rescue us. I love that when we get to the point where we are in

226
00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:11.149
a place of need, the best thing you can do is remind God of what he's already said. His promises are

227
00:45:11.159 --> 00:45:21.719
for you and whatever it is in your time of need. God is someone who will hear your prayer, but I

228
00:45:21.729 --> 00:45:28.070
love it. When our prayers are based on his scriptures, they're based on his promises. It's not just

229
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:36.620
us begging and pleading for God to intervene. It's us reminding Him of what He's already promised us.

230
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:46.909
And so we need to stop everything and remind God of the promises that He has made. And that's what

231
00:45:46.919 --> 00:45:52.989
Jehoshaphat does. And I love, that's how He starts, right? He gathers the people. And then when He

232
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.419
starts to pray, he tells them these are the promises that God has made us. And then He reminds God

233
00:45:59.429 --> 00:46:06.889
of those promises. Here's the next thing he does. He tells them it's time to fix our eyes, not on

234
00:46:06.899 --> 00:46:15.260
our power but on God's. And he already says, we can't go and match this powerful army, this army

235
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:22.979
that's coming against us. We cannot fight them and win. There's no way that we can, but he believes

236
00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:30.830
wholeheartedly that everything isn't dependent on them. It is dependent on God that God has the

237
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:39.469
power to overcome. And so he says, for, we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us

238
00:46:39.479 --> 00:46:45.899
and we don't know what to do, but our eyes are on you. I love it when we come to a place in our

239
00:46:45.909 --> 00:46:52.870
lives when we just know that this is just bigger than we are. And until that moment comes, I don't

240
00:46:52.879 --> 00:46:57.959
think we get to a place where we want to fast and pray. I think up until that point, we're still

241
00:46:57.969 --> 00:47:02.560
trying to figure things out in our own strength and we have enough people resources, maybe enough

242
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:08.540
back up in, in one way or another that we feel that we can lean on what we've got so that we don't

243
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:17.040
have to get to that place where we truly do fast and pray and do what Jehoshaphat does in this story.

244
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.719
And that's a mistake on our part. I think the sooner and the quicker that we get to the place where

245
00:47:21.729 --> 00:47:27.090
we recognize that no matter what the situation is that we're always powerless in comparison to the

246
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:33.219
enemy that is before us, that we understand that God's power is all that we need and we need to fix

247
00:47:33.229 --> 00:47:37.949
our eyes on that power and not on anything else. Don't be deceived by your power. Don't be deceived

248
00:47:37.959 --> 00:47:44.860
by someone else's. Don't be deceived by who you know, don't be decide, don't be, don't be the person

249
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:51.149
who decides that things are going to be ok because you've got an inside man and woman. You got

250
00:47:51.159 --> 00:47:58.080
someone who's, who's got your back and watching over you. I see this all the time in professional

251
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:03.199
sports where people just feel like that their talent is indispensable. I'll tell you, I'll tell you

252
00:48:03.209 --> 00:48:09.600
what people will always do over talent. They will always protect the brand. They don't care about

253
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.610
the talent as much as they care about the brand and the moment you start affecting the brand, I'll

254
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.760
tell you you're gone

255
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:21.620
and that's true for any business. It's true for anything in life. And I tell you that people will

256
00:48:21.629 --> 00:48:27.020
ultimately decide that you are not worth the trouble and will move on from you. And these are people

257
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:33.729
who you would have maybe sacrificed everything for. But at some point, they have to make a decision

258
00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:39.649
for themselves and realize that I can't risk what I've got going on. So I'm gonna have to risk you

259
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.580
and it's, and it's gonna blindside you and you're gonna, you're gonna see that come out of nowhere.

260
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:50.139
It's gonna hit you. And you're gonna say, how did this happen? And you gotta look at this as the

261
00:48:50.149 --> 00:48:55.169
ultimate betrayal. But no, you need to reconsider that because your first betrayal was that you

262
00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:59.000
didn't put the power in God's hands. You put it in someone's hands.

263
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:09.209
You see the power has to be in God's hands, not in any person's hands. When you put it in God's

264
00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:16.699
hands. God always got your back. He will always give you the victory because you put yourself

265
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:26.489
in between yourself and the blessings that He has in store for you. You believe that today

266
00:49:29.479 --> 00:49:31.250
the victory that he has promised you.

267
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:39.399
And I love that he just doesn't count on any power that he has other than the power that is, that is

268
00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:49.110
God. And it's so important because there's a doctor by the name of Caroline Leaf and she's a

269
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:57.020
believer in and she wanted to prove what the impact of, of prayer would have on the human mind.

270
00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:09.219
And this is what she says. It's been found that 12 minutes of daily focused prayer over an eight

271
00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:16.290
week period can change the brain to such an extent that it can be measured on a brain scan.

272
00:50:21.479 --> 00:50:26.659
And we sometimes are just putting all of our time and efforts into, I don't know, talking things out,

273
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.530
talking things through worrying about things, having anxiety over things, just allowing things to

274
00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:41.479
overpower us, overwhelm us. And we don't realize that we could be handling this so differently that

275
00:50:41.489 --> 00:50:47.050
it could not only have an impact on our minds, but it could actually have an impact on the way that

276
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:55.620
we actually see outcomes. I imagine that not only does prayer touch the heart of God, but it

277
00:50:55.629 --> 00:51:03.459
actually changes the chemistry of your brain. And God is saying that if you put your faith and trust

278
00:51:03.469 --> 00:51:08.550
in me, this is what's going to happen, this is how things are going to change. This is how things

279
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:14.699
are going to be different like never before. And that's why it's time to stop everything and fast.

280
00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:21.360
You see, it's not just about the praying, it's about the fasting, it's about the giving up part. And

281
00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:27.629
we would think that we're giving things up to somehow barter with God. Like if I give this up God,

282
00:51:27.639 --> 00:51:32.780
then you're gonna be able to do this in return. God is not looking for an exchange here. There's

283
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:37.699
nothing you could ever offer that is more important than what Jesus already gave

284
00:51:39.979 --> 00:51:49.780
than what he already did. There's nothing that you have that God needs except you. He just wants you.

285
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:56.340
And so when we say God, I'm going to put everything into this and I'm going to, and by that, I mean,

286
00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:01.340
myself, I'm not going to divide myself like I normally do. I'm not going to give you just a couple

287
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:06.090
of minutes a day. I'm not going to just pretend like you're just going to cover me and you're just

288
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:12.580
going to take care of me and you're just going to comfort me. No, I'm going to take this seriously

289
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.050
and I'm going to fast and pray and that's what the people did. They stopped everything and they

290
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:25.000
fasted in second chronicles in chapter 20 and look at verse 12 and 13. It says we do not know what

291
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:30.590
to do, but our eyes are on you and then all the men of Judah with their wives and Children and

292
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:38.139
little ones, they stood there before the Lord and they stood there before God as a family and they

293
00:52:38.149 --> 00:52:47.219
stood God before them as a unit. And you know, the Bible tells us that sometimes we don't have that

294
00:52:47.949 --> 00:52:54.929
just don't, for whatever reason, we're just not there yet. We had it maybe lost it. We may be trying

295
00:52:54.939 --> 00:53:00.699
to have that and we haven't gotten that in the way that we wanted to.

296
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.219
But God says that wherever two or three are gathered in my name,

297
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.000
I'm in the midst of them.

298
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:18.500
I am with them. You know what that means to me. It means to me, it means that we can still create

299
00:53:19.199 --> 00:53:25.610
that same kind of powerful standing before God moment that we see in the story

300
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:35.060
and when you gather and you are in agreement and you do so in the name of Jesus, then chains are

301
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:35.620
broken.

302
00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:42.000
Breakthroughs take place.

303
00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:55.850
And what God says is that you may underestimate the power of community. And that's why Jesus says I

304
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.429
am the bread of life

305
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.620
because when you gather in my name

306
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:13.580
and you break bread with each other and you stop everything to fast and to pray, here's what happens.

307
00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:15.260
I come with power.

308
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:25.739
I come with power. Is there a place in your life where you need power right now? Is there a place

309
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:31.689
where you are anticipating a breakthrough that you want something to happen? How many people do you

310
00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:37.050
have praying for your breakthrough right now? How many people do you have that are, are stopping

311
00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:44.550
everything to pray and to fast with you? See, we sometimes just wait for God to bring the blessing.

312
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.570
But but here's how you can accelerate. The blessing is by stopping everything to fast and pray.

313
00:54:52.909 --> 00:54:59.489
That's how you can make it happen. And and, and God is giving us the insight in, in how this can

314
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:06.149
happen in this story. And so it's time for us to believe

315
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:17.909
that we can experience everything that we need when we stop everything to pray and fast. Here's

316
00:55:17.919 --> 00:55:22.000
another point. It's time to believe that the battle belongs to God

317
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:32.360
in second Corinthians in chapter 20 in verse 15 and 17, it says, don't be afraid or discouraged

318
00:55:33.669 --> 00:55:39.570
because of this vast army. The battle is not yours but God's I want you to go out and face them

319
00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:45.489
tomorrow and the promise is the Lord will be with you. Now, I want you to think of it this way.

320
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.229
Every enemy you have is not your enemy. It's God's.

321
00:55:51.129 --> 00:55:51.939
Now

322
00:55:56.899 --> 00:56:02.360
when I was in a schoolyard in elementary school,

323
00:56:04.949 --> 00:56:15.489
there were a bunch of people that were teasing this kid. Yeah. And for a while I was telling others

324
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:23.239
not to do it. But it got to the point where it was fun to do it. And I kind of wanted to join in

325
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:33.250
and there was a day in which everyone was shouting the kid's name and asking him to lick the fence

326
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:41.760
post on one of the coldest winter days, right? It's like stuff that you do when you're a kid and

327
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.510
there's evil and darkness in your heart.

328
00:56:47.469 --> 00:56:52.659
And, and so everyone's calling this kid's name and they tell him to do it and the kid doesn't know

329
00:56:52.669 --> 00:56:56.530
why he shouldn't until his tongue gets stuck.

330
00:56:59.229 --> 00:57:03.989
And the principal gets called out and he comes up with a hot rag and he's putting it on the kid's

331
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.229
tongue and, and of course, a piece of skin was stuck on that fence post. It's probably still there.

332
00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:16.780
Or the next day

333
00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:20.969
his dad came to school.

334
00:57:23.399 --> 00:57:33.189
Now, normally a parent wouldn't be allowed in the school yard. But this father, he didn't care

335
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:41.189
and he just like, went after every kid because he didn't know who it was.

336
00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:53.590
And because we touched his son, his father showed up and his father was ready to beat up every kid

337
00:57:53.889 --> 00:58:00.409
in that school yard. If he had to, to make sure that we never did that to his son again. Does that

338
00:58:00.419 --> 00:58:08.780
make sense that we can resonate with that? And what he did is he just started, started shouting at

339
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:14.949
anybody and everybody and, and, and if there was a group of kids that were further away and hadn't

340
00:58:14.959 --> 00:58:20.530
heard and stopped what they were doing, he made sure he ran over there too and he found himself just

341
00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.729
running over to whatever group of kids were in there. It didn't matter what grade they were in and

342
00:58:24.739 --> 00:58:28.229
he had kindergartners in tears.

343
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:39.139
Let let alone grade sixers filled with fear, but he was just like running all over that yard, making

344
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:45.290
sure that the warning was heard by everyone. I want you to imagine that when you have an enemy in

345
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.590
this life and in this world and God is running around the world for you,

346
00:58:53.379 --> 00:58:57.310
he's making sure that no one can lay a hand on you.

347
00:59:00.639 --> 00:59:09.479
I don't know if you believe in a God who defends you like that, but you need to start because every

348
00:59:09.489 --> 00:59:12.830
battle doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the Lord.

349
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:19.620
And it's time for us to understand that and to believe that.

350
00:59:22.479 --> 00:59:27.469
And you know, what is amazing about this story is that Jehoshaphat does something that was unusual

351
00:59:27.479 --> 00:59:35.060
for its day and for its time and he said it was time for them to go out into battle, but it was time

352
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:43.300
for them to worship. And so look at what it says in second chronicles chapter 20 verse 21 he says

353
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:49.540
that after he consulted the people, the king appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to

354
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:56.520
the Lord and praising him for his holy splendor. And this is what they sang. Give thanks to the Lord.

355
00:59:56.689 --> 01:00:06.469
His faithful love endures forever. I I I want you to see that what they sang about was what makes

356
01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:08.070
God powerful.

357
01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.610
It is the way that he loves us.

358
01:00:15.929 --> 01:00:27.050
It is the way that he loves you. See, it is his love for you that you can count on. And that is what

359
01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:36.330
gives the power in your life to believe that the battle belongs to the Lord. And just in case they

360
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:43.679
forgot it as they were marching against a greater enemy. They sang it and they were reminded of it

361
01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:52.080
every step of the way. And you see every time worry would enter every time, fear would get a hold.

362
01:00:52.090 --> 01:01:00.040
Every time they would become anxious, they would sing. We give thanks to you God because your love

363
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:07.479
endures forever. Every time they started to doubt it every time they maybe even didn't believe it,

364
01:01:07.659 --> 01:01:14.629
they began to shout these words to sing them, to believe in them and to remind each other. And then

365
01:01:14.639 --> 01:01:22.429
they would look at each other as they were marching and say, yes, the love of God endures forever.

366
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:30.610
He will not stop loving us as we go out into battle. The love of God endures forever. We will keep

367
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:37.719
singing to the Lord because his love is greater than any enemy. We've got, it doesn't matter how

368
01:01:37.729 --> 01:01:44.389
they have joined together to try to come against us and defeat us, they are already defeated because

369
01:01:44.399 --> 01:01:53.030
the love of God endures forever. You see, God is so capable of giving us that victory. But it has to

370
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.360
also come from a place of worship. It has to come from a place of praise. It has to come from a

371
01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:06.350
place in which we are able to recognize this. Now, what's beautiful about this story isn't just the

372
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.350
parts that we've just looked at, but it's this part that comes next. You see it's time to gather the

373
01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:19.580
blessing. You see, when they go out into the into battle, the Bible tells us that something really

374
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:26.260
strange happens that before the Mobi and the Ammonites and the Mennonites. I don't know. I think

375
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:34.429
that's what they were called the Meunites. Before they go out into battle. Guess what happens? Other

376
01:02:34.439 --> 01:02:42.239
enemies come and start to give them a hard time enemies that they didn't know. They had. God sent

377
01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:47.260
other people to destroy their army before they even got to Israel.

378
01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:55.959
See, God was able to gather enemies against their enemy.

379
01:02:58.189 --> 01:03:04.719
I don't know if that excites you or not in your life. But when you've got an enemy and God sends a

380
01:03:04.729 --> 01:03:11.500
bigger enemy to take care of your enemy, I think that's worthy of some worship and praise now.

381
01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.030
And, and, and the Bible reminds us that it's time to gather the blessing because what happens is

382
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:26.219
that when they finally show up at the appointed place for the battle, their enemies already

383
01:03:26.229 --> 01:03:35.429
destroyed, they're all dead. They get there and all they see is bodies everywhere and to make things

384
01:03:35.439 --> 01:03:45.979
worse for everyone else. But amazing for them is that all there is left isn't just bodies, but all

385
01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:46.800
their plunder.

386
01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:55.919
Everything that they thought they would be able to take from Israel. Israel is now taking from them

387
01:03:57.449 --> 01:04:05.169
and it's just there on the ground just for them to pick it up. That's all they had to do was just go

388
01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:12.050
and gather it. And that's why it says in verse 25 that King Jehoshaphat and his men went out to

389
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:19.260
gather the plunder and they found vast amounts of equipment, clothing and other valuables more than

390
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:25.870
they could carry. There was so much plunder that it took them three days just to collect it all that.

391
01:04:25.879 --> 01:04:32.320
On the fourth day, they gathered in the Valley of Blessing and the reason it's called that and it

392
01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:40.520
got its name that day because the people praised and thanked the Lord there and to this day, it's

393
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:48.060
still called the Valley of Blessing. Do you want to believe God for the value of blessing today? Do

394
01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:55.189
you want to believe that for you that whatever the enemy is, whatever the enemy has been, whatever

395
01:04:55.199 --> 01:05:02.689
the enemy is done, no matter what has happened before this moment, everything can change, you can go

396
01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:08.870
in and you can just collect the blessing when you do things the way that God describes us and

397
01:05:08.879 --> 01:05:18.129
proclaims us to do them. He's putting it out there for us to inherit this, to experience this. And

398
01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:26.860
then he sends the people into not just a place of blessing but into a place of rest and this is how

399
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:37.510
the story ends. It ends in second chronicles chapter 2029 30. And it says that when all the

400
01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:45.729
surrounding Kingdoms heard that the Lord himself had fought against the enemies of Israel, the fear

401
01:05:45.739 --> 01:05:55.379
of God came over them. And so Jehoshaphat's kingdom was at peace for his God had given him rest -

402
01:05:55.389 --> 01:06:05.620
look at this - on every side. See when God fights for us, he gives us rest and peace, not just in one

403
01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:08.659
area of our life, but on all sides,

404
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:17.520
he blessed them beyond their imagination and then gave them something that they were troubled with

405
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.120
at the very beginning, which was peace of mind.

406
01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:28.699
You see, they couldn't have peace of mind when an enemy that size was coming for them. But God not

407
01:06:28.709 --> 01:06:35.020
only took care of the enemy, he blessed them beyond measure and then gave them peace on every side.

408
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:41.100
You're ready to receive that in your life. You ready to have that for you because this is how we can

409
01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:49.560
have it. Put everything aside because it's time to pray and fast. God bless you guys. Thank you so

410
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:49.979
much.

411
01:06:56.899 --> 01:07:02.570
Would you stand as we would just wrap this up with a, a beautiful service? Thank you God for

412
01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.449
everything you've done today and, and for what you're gonna do in the weeks to come. I know that

413
01:07:07.459 --> 01:07:13.719
God's got great things in store for you. I know that He wants you to just walk in and collect your

414
01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:20.540
blessings. I, I know that He wants that for you. He wants to give you the victory over every enemy.

415
01:07:21.419 --> 01:07:28.239
He wants to give you that peace on every side. And so father right now, we want to thank you. We

416
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:35.929
want to bless your name for all that you have done and for all that you're going to do. I thank you

417
01:07:35.939 --> 01:07:42.770
that today is a day in which we can honor you and bless you beyond our own, even imagining that we

418
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:50.149
can worship you and praise you and put our faith in your power and your promises today that you can

419
01:07:50.159 --> 01:07:56.149
provide the breakthrough that we need in the area of our life where we need it most. You see where

420
01:07:56.159 --> 01:08:01.540
it is that we aren't trusting you. You see also where we are trusting you God, but but we're not

421
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:07.879
seeing the victory the way that you want us to have it. And so I pray that today you would speak to

422
01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:13.409
us in the area where we need to make the adjustments, the changes, where we need to take these

423
01:08:13.419 --> 01:08:20.629
principles and put them into practice so that we can collect that blessing that you have for us. We

424
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.819
don't even have to go and fight the enemy because you've already fought them for us because you've

425
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:31.839
already defeated the enemy. You did it through Jesus. You already gave us that victory on the cross.

426
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:37.959
And when you rose from the dead and you are giving us that victory right now in this room. I pray

427
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:43.580
that the power of the resurrection and the resurrected Jesus will reign powerfully in our lives

428
01:08:43.589 --> 01:08:49.679
today and give us the victory over our minds. And then it would give us victory over our bodies and

429
01:08:49.688 --> 01:08:56.738
over our circumstances and our situational hazards and the things that are tempting us and the

430
01:08:56.749 --> 01:09:02.918
things that are breaking us and the things that have somehow just ruptured us in our relationship

431
01:09:02.929 --> 01:09:10.990
with you. Father. I pray that you would remove every enemy, that you would defeat every enemy. And

432
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.919
that before we even faced them, lord, that we would see them defeated. Because that is how you love

433
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:31.019
us. Your love endures forever, your love endures forever. And we pray these things in Jesus' name.

434
01:09:31.418 --> 01:09:39.708
Amen. A man. God bless you guys. Hey, let's sing this last song And it's so great to see you all

435
01:09:39.719 --> 01:09:41.458
here today. Amen.

436
01:09:59.790 --> 01:09:59.930
What

437
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.209
this way?

438
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:11.850
Think? Well,

439
01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:15.669
we

440
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:20.240
